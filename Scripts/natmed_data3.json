Peak plasma levels occurred 1-2 hours after intake (101118).\nDistribution\nIn an animal model, the ba ji tian constituents monotropein and deacetyl asperulosidic acid were found widely distributed to all tissues following oral administration. Ba ji tian was more bioavailable in females (101118).\nExcretion\nIn an animal model, the half-life for the ba ji tian constituents monotropein and deacetyl asperulosidic acid was 3-5 hours following oral administration (101118).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of ba ji tian is the root. The root contains several active constituents, including an iridoid lactone called morindolide, iridoid glucosides such as monotropein and deacetyl asperulosidic acid, anthraquinones, monoterpene glycosides, and sterols, including beta-sitosterol (448, 451, 452, 101118, 101119). Other constituents include succinic acid, nystose, inulin-type hexasaccharide, and heptasaccharide (449). The essential oil of ba ji tian contains 1,2-benzedicarboxylic acid, hexadecanoic acid, hexanoic acid, and nonanoic acid. It also contains aldehydes, alkenes, benzenes, and lactones (94270).\nAcaricidal effects\nThe essential oil of ba ji tian has acaricidal effects against Dermatophagoides spp. and Haemaphysalis longicornis. The active ingredients appear to be 2-methylbenzaldehyde and its analogues (94270).\nAnti-fatigue effects\nAnimal research suggests that ba ji tian might demonstrate anti-fatigue properties (453). The constituent polysaccharides likely play a role in this activity (33274).\nAnti-inflammatory properties\nBa ji tian has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in traditional medicine. In animal and laboratory research, ba ji tian extract and the constituent iridoid glycoside, monotropein, has been found to exert antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity (33267, 33268). Ba ji tian extract also seems to inhibit inflammatory enzymes and mediators (33267). Ba ji tian is also of interest for inflammatory bowel disease due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In an animal model, ba ji tian extracts reduced the symptoms of colitis, likely by decreasing levels of inflammatory cytokines (101119).\nAntiarthritic effects\nIn vitro research shows that an iridoid glycoside, monotropein, isolated from ba ji tian increases proliferation of chondrocytes, inhibits cartilage matrix degradation, and inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis via interruption of the nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. This mechanism delays arthritis progression and improves articular tissue morphology in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, when monotropein is given by intra-articular injection twice weekly for 8 weeks (113412).\nAntidepressant properties\nOligosaccharide constituents of ba ji tian are reported to have antidepressant activity possibly by increasing serotonergic effects in the brain (449, 3558, 33263, 101213). They activate tryptophan hydroxylase and inactivate serotonin decarboxylase in the gut, increasing synthesis of cerebral serotonin (113408). These constituents also play a role in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway of the medial prefrontal cortex (101213). Animal research shows that inulin-like oligosaccharides isolated from ba ji tian act in the hippocampus to decrease expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-beta, and caspase-1, and to reduce activation of microglial cells and NLRP3 inflammasomes (113410). In other animal research, ba ji tian oligosaccharides reduce depression-like behavior, and have a protective effect on cerebral histopathology. They reduce depression-associated mitochondrial damage in the astrocyte subtype of glial cells, reducing production of reactive oxygen species and release of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6 and 1-beta, and thereby reducing neuronal damage and death. Maintenance of mitochondrial function, and removal of impaired mitochondria via autophagy occurs in response to upregulation of mitofusion 2 (Mfn2) expression in astrocytes by ba ji tian oligosaccharides, leading to inactivation of the P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway.\nAntiosteoporotic properties\nBa ji tian is used traditionally to build bone mass and for osteoporosis. In animal research, ba ji tian, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has been shown to improve bone mass (33273, 33277, 101212). Anthraquinones found in ba ji tian, including rubiadin and 2-hydroxy-1-methoxy-anthroquinone, appear to inhibit bone resorption, possibly by reducing the activity of osteoclasts (33275, 101211). In a rodent model of osteoporosis, polysaccharides from ba ji tian given orally for 8 weeks enhance bone mineral density and bone volume, possibly via suppression of a pathway involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and its coactivator, PGC-1-alpha (113409).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn a rodent model of osteoporosis, polysaccharides from ba ji tian increase serum levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione, and decrease levels of malondialdehyde (113409).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro and in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis, a water extract of ba ji tian root reduces skin lesions and symptoms, and reduces epidermal/dermal thickness, mast cell infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. The mechanism involves inhibition of expression of a non-coding RNA gene, MALAT1, which in turn reduces expression of C-C chemokine receptor 7, and inhibition of cellular proliferation and inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (113411).\nDiabetic effects\nBa ji tian is used traditionally for diabetes. Research in animal models suggests that ba ji tian might reduce or increase serum glucose levels (33264).\nFertility effects\nBa ji tian is used traditionally for male infertility. In animal research, ba ji tian extract promotes spermatogenesis and the healing of reproductive organs. This activity is attributed to constituent polysaccharides, possibly through reduction of inflammation and regulation of levels of sex hormones (94271). Ba ji tian extract also appears to protect Leydig cells from oxidative stress (33272).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nTraditional uses of ba ji tian include cancer and increasing white blood cell count. In an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease, ba ji tian extracts reduce abnormal immune responses by regulating proliferating T lymphocytes (101119)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of babassu are the dried, powdered mesocarp (the inner layer of the husk), and the oil extracted from the kernel. The mesocarp contains starch, protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrates, fiber, and minerals (101224, 101225). It also contains the polysaccharide glucan MP1 (25678). Babassu also contains tannins, steroid compounds, and triterpenes (25679). The oil obtained from babassu kernels is rich in medium chain triglycerides (101226, 106551).\nAnti-inflammatory effect\nIn vitro, babassu oil has been shown to stimulate fibroblast migration, inhibit nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and increase levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin 6 (106551). In a mouse model of inflammation, topical application of babassu oil reduces swelling, hyperplasia, and myeloperoxidase activity (106551). Another animal study suggests that a babassu mesocarp constituent, MP1 glucan, enhances phagocytosis and reduces acetic acid-induced vascular permeability, which is an early-stage inflammatory reaction (25678). However, other animal research suggests that an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp flour given intraperitoneally activates peritoneal macrophages, resulting in increased nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide production, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release, and MHC class II expression (25676).\nAntioxidant effect\nIn vitro research suggests that an aqueous extract of dried babassu mesocarp does not have antioxidant activity (101225).\nAntithrombotic effect\nEvidence from animal research suggests that babassu reduces carrageenin-induced thrombosis in mice. The antithrombotic effect may be due to increased macrophage nitric oxide production, and slowed blood coagulation. No reduction in the number of platelets was noted (25679).\nAntithyroid effect\nIn animal and in vitro research, babassu has demonstrated significant antithyroid effects, similar to those observed with propylthiouracil and methimazole (25680).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp is associated with reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with further reductions observed when used in combination with resistance training (106552).\nErgogenic effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp in combination with resistance training is associated with increases in maximum strength when compared with control (106552).\nImmunomodulating effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp is associated with increased production of activated B lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and reduced production of activated macrophages and interleukin 6 (106552).\nIrritant effects\nInjecting a babassu extract into the pleura of the lungs in rats causes inflammation and adhesions. This suggests that babassu may be a suitable agent for pleurodesis (101224).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp is associated with reductions in body weight, with further reductions observed when used in combination with resistance training. Reductions in retroperitoneal and interstitial fat deposits also were observed (106552).\nWound healing effects\nLaboratory studies in rats with surgically-induced wounds show that local treatment with babassu aqueous extracts and babassu oil can produce improvements in wound healing, as measured by the rate of re-epithelialization, increased tensile strength, increased fibroblast proliferation, blood vessel formation, and collagen deposition, and reduced inflammation (25674, 25675, 25677, 25681, 25683, 25684, 106551)."

Another small clinical study in university students shows that taking a different Bach flower remedy consisting of essence from 10 different flowers, four drops daily for 2 weeks, does not reduce test anxiety when compared with placebo (28988).\n\nBach flower remedies have also been studied in other patients with anxiety. In young children undergoing dental treatments, a small clinical study shows that taking four drops of a specific Bach flower remedy (Five Flowers Remedy, also called the Rescue Remedy) 15 minutes before a procedure does not reduce provider-assessed anxiety when compared with music therapy or placebo. However, this product modestly lowers heart rate and reduces behavioral disturbances during the procedure when compared with placebo, which may indicate reduced anxiety (104536).

Dr. Bach believed that illnesses are \"manifestations of flaws\" in personality. He believed that a person's own nature, character, and feelings play a key role in the development of diseases. Therefore, Bach flower remedies are often promoted to help mental and emotional problems, rather than to directly treat physical ailments (28987). Dr. Bach also believed that the vibrations/energy retained in these remedies \"rebalances\" the conscious and unconscious (104536).\n\nMany people often refer to Bach flower remedies as homeopathic products because they are diluted like homeopathic remedies. In fact, Dr. Bach developed the first 7 of his 38 remedies while working at the London Homeopathic Hospital. However, there are differences in the principles of Bach flower remedies compared to homeopathy. For example, successive dilutions are an integral part of homeopathy, but are not a part of Bach flower remedies. Furthermore, the law of similars in homeopathy does not apply to Bach flower remedies. Also, in many cases, extremely diluted toxic substances are used in homeopathy, whereas Bach flower remedies do not use toxic substances.\n\nBach flower remedies are usually so dilute that they contain little or no detectable amounts of active ingredients. Therefore, just as with homeopathic preparations, Bach flower remedies are not expected to have any beneficial pharmacological effects, or any drug interactions or side effects (28987).

Bacteremia and sepsis have been reported in patients with indwelling or central venous catheters or patients who are severely ill and/or immunocompromised, including preterm infants, that were using probiotic products (4380, 8561, 13008, 13070, 90298, 102416, 103444, 105138, 105140, 105141)(107543, 107597, 107599, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). However, reports of pathogenic colonization in relatively healthy patients with intact immune systems who do not have indwelling or central venous catheters are extremely rare (4380, 4389, 4390, 4391, 4393, 4398, 105139, 107543, 107545, 107546, 107547).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Oral Bacillus coagulans seems to be beneficial for constipation.\nClinical research in individuals with mild intermittent constipation shows that taking B. coagulans SNZ 1969 (CTCBIO, Inc.) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 8 weeks reduces colonic transit time, increases the number of weekly complete spontaneous bowel movements, and improves bowel discomfort when compared with placebo. Colonic transit time was reduced by at least 25% in 58% of patients taking B. coagulans, compared with 32% of patients taking placebo (107613). Other clinical research in patients with functional constipation shows that taking B. coagulans Unique IS2 (Unique Biotech Limited) 2 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks modestly increases the number of bowel movements and reduces abdominal pain and pain with defecation when compared with placebo. Also, 98% of patients achieved normal stool consistency, compared with 74% of those taking placebo (107612). Adding lactulose 10 grams to this regimen increases stool frequency when compared with placebo, but not when compared with lactulose alone. However, normal stool consistency was achieved earlier and by more patients in those taking lactulose plus B. coagulans when compared with lactulose alone. The combination was also more beneficial for reducing defecation pain, abdominal pain, and sensations of incomplete evacuation (107614). Also, a small clinical study in adults with constipation-dominant functional bowel disorders shows that taking a specific supplement containing B. coagulans 1 billion CFUs twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves abdominal pain and abdominal distention, as well as discomfort and effort during defecation, when compared with baseline (104232). However, the validity of the findings in this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Bacillus coagulans seems to be beneficial for IBS.\nClinical research in adults with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking B. coagulans daily for 56-90 days improves quality of life and decreases bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and stool frequency when compared with placebo. Improvements in headache, anxiety, and constipation have also been shown (92730, 92735, 92740, 105169). In addition, meta-analyses show that taking B. coagulans reduces overall symptom, straining, and/or abdominal pain severity when compared with placebo (107594, 110866). In one study, taking B. coagulans for 80 days resulted in no symptoms in 63% of individuals, compared with only 21% of those taking placebo (105169). Doses used in some of this clinical research have included a specific B. coagulans MTCC5856 product (Lactospore, Sabinsa Corporation) 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 90 days (92730), another specific B. coagulans product (GanedenBC30, Ganeden Biotech Inc.) 300 million to 2 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks (92735, 92740), B. coagulans LBSC (Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd.) 2 billion CFUs three times daily for 80 days (105169), or B. coagulans Unique IS2 2 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks (110866). Other clinical research in adults with IBS shows that taking a specific combination product (Colinox, DMG Italia SRL) containing B. coagulans and simethicone after each meal three times daily for 4 weeks improves bloating and discomfort, but not pain, when compared with placebo (92726).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking an inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 product (Staimune, Kerry, Inc) 1 billion cells daily for 2 weeks does not improve jump power or muscle endurance when compared with placebo (107610). This study might not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. A larger study in resistance-trained males shows that taking B. coagulans Unique IS-2 2 billion colony-forming units daily for 60 days in combination with 20 grams of an 80% whey protein concentrate modestly improves some measures of power and muscle strength when compared with taking whey protein alone. However, some measures of strength were not improved, and there was no effect on maximum oxygen consumption, muscle hypertrophy, or body composition (110878).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this purpose.\nCirrhosis. Oral Bacillus coagulans has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with liver cirrhosis who are at increased risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) shows that taking a combination of B. coagulans, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium butyricum, and Bacillus mesentericus three times daily, in conjunction with norfloxacin for 6 months, does not reduce the risk of developing SBP when compared with norfloxacin alone (92731).\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this condition.\nDiabetes. Oral Bacillus coagulans has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30) 100 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 10 billion CFUs, and fructo-oligosaccharides 500 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and insulin and improves measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo. There was no effect on plasma lipids (107731).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for acute diarrhea or diarrhea-dominant functional bowel disorders.\nClinical research in infants 6-24 months of age with acute diarrhea of various causes shows that taking B. coagulans 120 million colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for up to 5 days in conjunction with oral rehydration solution does not decrease duration, frequency, or volume of diarrhea when compared with oral rehydration solution and placebo (92738). However, a small clinical study in adults with acute diarrhea shows that taking a specific supplement (Lactic Acid Bacillus) containing B. coagulans 2 billion CFUs, three times daily for 7 days, reduces diarrhea and improves abdominal pain when compared with placebo (100853).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diarrhea-dominant functional bowel disorders shows that taking a specific supplement containing B. coagulans 1 billion CFUs twice daily for 4 weeks reduces abdominal pain, abdominal distention, discomfort and effort during defecation, and the number of stools classified as diarrhea when compared with baseline (104232). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for dyspepsia.\nSeveral small studies show that B. coagulans can improve symptoms of dyspepsia (104231, 104232, 104233, 107611). In one study, 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) were taken twice daily for 4 weeks, resulting in an improvement in abdominal pain and abdominal distention when compared with placebo (104232). Some studies have used B. coagulans in combination with other probiotics. In adults with functional dyspepsia, taking a combination of B. coagulans MY01 and Bacillus subtilis MY02 as 1.25 billion CFUs each twice daily for 8 weeks improves postprandial distress scores of at least 0.7 in 48% of patients, compared with only 20% of those taking placebo (107611). A small clinical study in older adults aged 55-75 years with indigestion, abdominal pain, and flatulence shows that taking a probiotic syrup containing B. coagulans 500 million CFUs with digestive enzymes (alpha amylase 25 mg, pepsin 10 mg, and lipase 1.5 mg) 5 mL twice daily for 5 days reduces symptoms of dyspepsia when compared with placebo (104233). Also, a small study in adults with non-specific gastrointestinal discomfort shows that taking a specific combination supplement (SNZ TriBac, Sanzyme Biologics) containing B. coagulans SNZ 1969, Bacillus clausii SNZ 1971, and B. subtilis SNZ 1972, 2 billion CFUs daily for 30 days, decreases self-reported symptoms of burping, belching, and sour taste when compared with placebo (104231). It is unclear if these effects are due to B. coagulans, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nFlatulence. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for flatulence.\nClinical research in children aged 6-8 years shows that taking B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30, Ganeden, Inc.) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 months modestly decreases the incidence of flatulence when compared with taking placebo (107615). However, preliminary clinical research in patients with postprandial intestinal gas-related symptoms shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Digestive Advantage Gas Defense Formula, Ganeden Biotech) containing this same strain of B. coagulans and an enzyme blend daily for 4 weeks does not improve bloating or gas when compared with placebo (92736).\nless\nGingivitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for gingivitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this condition.\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for H. pylori.\nIn patients with H. pylori, preliminary clinical research shows that taking B. coagulans (Donghai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd) 1050 mg three times daily for 8 weeks results in a 20% eradication rate 1-2 weeks after treatment. This was as effective as taking Clostridium butyricum 1050 mg twice daily, alone or in combination with B. coagulans (105168). This study is limited by lack of blinding and the lack of a placebo group. Also, it is unclear how B. coagulans compares to standard H. pylori eradication treatments.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for cholesterol reduction, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this purpose.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this purpose.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in infants with a gestational age of less than 33 weeks or a very low birth weight shows that taking B. coagulans 350 million colony-forming units daily until hospital discharge does not reduce the risk of NEC or death when compared with placebo. However, taking B. coagulans reduced the incidence of feeding intolerance in these newborns (92733). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with NAFLD shows that taking 1 capsule containing B. coagulans 1 billion colony-forming units plus 400 mg inulin for 8 weeks may be beneficial for treating inflammation associated with NAFLD when compared with placebo. However, this combination did not improve lipid profiles or glycemic indices. Inulin was used in this study as a prebiotic to ensure bacterial growth in the gut lumen (104230).\nless\nPostoperative ileus. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for postoperative ileus.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery shows that taking B. coagulans TBC169 105 million or 175 million colony-forming units the night before surgery, and then every 8 hours starting 8 hours after surgery, reduces time to first flatus by up to 10 hours when compared with placebo. There were also modest reductions in the rates of postoperative gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, distension, and ileus. However, there was no difference in time to first defecation or length of hospital stay (110879).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30, Ganeden Biotech Inc.) 2 billion colony-forming units daily for 60 days, in conjunction with standard therapy, reduces overall pain when compared with placebo. However, it does not reduce the number of painful or swollen joints or improve activities of daily living (92734).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in newborns shows that taking B. coagulans 100 million colony-forming units daily for one year reduces the incidence of acute rotaviral diarrhea. Taking B. coagulans decreases the incidence of diarrheal episodes by around 5 per year and reduces duration of diarrhea by around 3 days per episode when compared with placebo. However, taking B. coagulans does not reduce the occurrence of mild to moderate dehydration (92729).\nless\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Oral Bacillus coagulans has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with SIBO who were previously treated for 3 weeks with broad spectrum antibiotics shows that taking a specific probiotic product (Lactol, Bioplus Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd.) containing B. coagulans spores and fructo-oligosaccharides twice daily on 15 days per month for 6 months, in conjunction with minocycline, modestly decreases stomach pain and flatulence (91145).\nless\nTravelers' diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus coagulans for travelers' diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. coagulans for this condition.\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral Bacillus coagulans is beneficial for URTI prevention.\nClinical research in children aged 6-8 years shows that taking B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30, Ganeden, Inc.) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 months modestly decreases the incidence of some URTI symptoms, including nasal congestion, bloody nasal mucus, itchy nose, and hoarseness, but not others such as dry cough and sore throat, when compared with placebo (107615).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBacillus coagulans spores are stable in stomach acid due to a protective coating. When exposed to the acidic pH of the stomach, the spore coating absorbs water, swells, and begins to germinate. Germination continues in the small intestine, where B. coagulans rapidly multiplies. Around 85% of ingested B. coagulans is believed to reach the small intestine (92727, 104230).\nExcretion\nBacillus coagulans is excreted via the feces. Spores are present in the feces up to 7 days after administration (92727).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBacillus coagulans is a spore-forming, lactic acid-producing, Gram-positive bacillus that is not found in the normal human flora. However, it is considered a non-pathogenic, or \"friendly\", bacteria (92727).\n\nB. coagulans is used therapeutically as a probiotic. Probiotics are considered \"friendly\" bacteria and are taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body where the bacteria would normally occur. Alterations in the normal flora allows for potential colonization by pathogenic organisms (6088).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA small clinical study shows that tumor necrosis factor alpha and nuclear factor kappa-B are reduced in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) taking oral Bacillus coagulans with inulin. The presence of B. coagulans in the small intestine seems to reduce the growth of pathogenic bacteria. It is hypothesized that this reduces the production of lipopolysaccharides and their penetration into systemic circulation (104230). However, other clinical research shows that taking B. coagulans does not have beneficial effects on various inflammatory or anti-inflammatory markers (110878).\nAntibacterial effects\nBacillus coagulans might reduce pathogenic bacteria colonization through several mechanisms. B. coagulans produces coagulin, lactic acid, and lactosporin, which have antibacterial activity and might reduce pathogenic bacteria growth through this mechanism (6089, 6090, 15861, 92732). Animal research suggests that ingesting Bacillus spores increases immune response (15859). Animal research also shows that B. coagulans reduces colonization of some strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (15862). In humans, B. coagulans reduces colonization of Synergistiales and increases colonization of Bacillales and Lactobacillales (107613).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, Bacillus coagulans reduces fungal growth of Fusarium species (15863).\nImmune effects\nBacillus coagulans might reduce pathogenic bacteria colonization through several mechanisms. One of these potential mechanisms is through immune stimulating effects. Animal research suggests that ingesting Bacillus spores increases immune response (15859). Preliminary clinical research in adults with HIV-1 infection shows that taking B. coagulans daily for 90 days increases the percent of CD4+ T cells but does not increase overall CD4+ T cell counts (92739). In schoolchildren, taking B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 for 3 months had beneficial effects on inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins (IL)-6 and -8, and modulated levels of various immune markers (107615)."

It commonly inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and is used as a probiotic (104231, 110808, 110834, 110847). It is used to ferment soy to make food such as natto (110808, 110845). Some commercial products marketed as B. subtilis instead contain newly classified Bacillus species, including Bacillus inaqosorum, Bacillus spizizenii, and Bacillus stercoris (110856, 110857, 110858).",
            "Warnings": "Three previously recognized Bacillus subtilis subspecies have recently been reclassified as species (110857, 110858). One of which is Bacillus subtilis DE111 (Deerland Enzymes, Inc., Kennesaw, Ga., United States), a strain of Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum, now known as B. inaquosorum (110856). These previously classified subspecies are included in this topic.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that Bacillus subtilis is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",

Bacillus subtilis has been used with apparent safety in clinical studies. B. subtilis strains BS50, B2335, CU1, MB40, MY02, or R0179 have been used with apparent safety in doses of 2-10 billion colony forming units (CFUs) daily for 2-8 weeks (107611, 110841, 110843, 110846, 110847, 110848, 110854, 110859). One specific product, B. subtilis DE111, has been used with apparent safety in doses of one billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks or 5 billion CFUs daily for 10 weeks (110850). Another specific product (Medilac-S), containing a combination of B. subtilis R0179 and Enterococcus faecalis, has been used with apparent safety in doses providing up to 300 million CFUs of B. subtilis daily for up to 96 weeks (110853, 110860).\nCHILDREN: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Bacillus subtilis in children of any age.

A 70-year-old female recovered from bacteremia after this consumption was stopped and she was treated with vancomycin. It was hypothesized that this infection was due to an immunocompromised state related to age, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, multiple myeloma, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (110844). In a 67-year-old female, bacterial entry was suspected to be related to erosion of her esophagus (110862).\n\nThere have been other rare cases of bacteremia or infections due to B. subtilis. These cases are unlikely to be related to intake or supplementation but to an immunocompromised state and/or introduction of bacteria to the body via non-oral routes. Cases of bacteremia include a newborn infant with sepsis, an adult with esophageal perforation, and a patient undergoing bone marrow transplantation subjected to contaminated materials (110834, 110837, 110840).

There was no difference in stool water content or other gastrointestinal symptoms (110836). The effect of B. subtilis on symptoms of chronic diarrhea is unclear from this study.\nless\nDyslipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for dyslipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nDyspepsia. Oral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome studies have used B. subtilis in combination with other probiotics. In adults with functional dyspepsia, a small clinical study shows that taking a combination of B. subtilis MY02 and Bacillus coagulans MY01 as 1.25 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each twice daily for 8 weeks improves postprandial distress scores of at least 0.7 in 48% of patients, compared with only 20% of those taking placebo (107611). Also, a small study in adults with non-specific gastrointestinal discomfort shows that taking a specific combination supplement (SNZ TriBac, Sanzyme Biologics) containing B. subtilis SNZ 1972, Bacillus coagulans SNZ 1969, and Bacillus clausii SNZ 1971, 2 billion CFUs daily for 30 days, decreases self-reported symptoms of burping, belching, and sour taste when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and passing gas (104231). It is unclear if these effects are due to B. subtilis, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nFlatulence. It is unclear if oral Bacillus subtilis is beneficial for patients with flatulence.\nA small clinical study in healthy adult shows that taking B. subtilis BS50 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) once daily for 6 weeks does not affect the proportion of patients with flatulence when compared with placebo. However, the proportion of patients with an improvement in burping and bloating was more than doubled when compared with placebo (110841).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for Helicobacter pylori infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with IBS with diarrhea shows that taking B. subtilis 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs), along with Streptococcus faecium 900 million CFUs and tianeptine 37.5 mg three times daily, improves overall IBS symptoms to the same degree as taking the same doses of B. subtilis and Streptococcus faecium in combination with amitriptyline 10 mg daily for 4 weeks (100805). The same dose of B. subtilis was used by all patients; the effect of B. subtilis alone is unclear.\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for preventing NEC in infants, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical or adverse effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nNeonatal jaundice. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for preventing neonatal jaundice, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nPancreatitis. Oral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients hospitalized with mild acute pancreatitis shows that taking a combination of B. subtilis and Enterococcus faecium reduces hospital length of stay by approximately 0.7 days when compared with taking placebo. There were also modest reductions in time to relief of abdominal symptoms and time to oral feeding (110849). The dose of B. subtilis is unclear from this study. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or the combination.\nless\nPrematurity. Oral or parenteral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that receiving B. subtilis, along with Enterococcus faecium and multivitamins (Medilac-Vita) twice daily with mosapride 0.5 mg three times daily modestly increases the decline in serum levels of total bilirubin and the fading of jaundice compared with mosapride in combination with Saccharomyces boulardii or routine care only. Growth rate, symptoms of abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal motility, rates of feeding intolerance, and incidence rates of complications such as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, were all improved in the groups receiving mosapride and probiotics compared with routine care only (110852). The dose of B. subtilis is unclear from this study. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to B. subtilis, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nSepsis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bacillus subtilis for preventing sepsis in infants, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. subtilis for this purpose.\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of over 50 clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific product containing B. subtilis R0179 and Enterococcus faecium R0026 (Medilac-S), 3 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily of for 4-96 weeks, as adjunctive therapy with oral aminosalicylates, usually sulfasalazine or mesalazine, increases the likelihood of inducing clinical remission by 21% when compared with the conventional therapy alone. The proportion of patients reporting symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea was reduced by 40% to 53%. Most individual studies showed that these probiotics reduced the likelihood of symptom recurrence; however, a pooled analysis for this outcome could not be conducted (110853). It is unclear if any effects are due to B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or the combination.\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Oral Bacillus subtilis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn open-label study in critically ill adults receiving ventilation shows that receiving B. subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis (Medilac-S) three times daily through a nasogastric feeding tube for up to 14 days results in microbiologically confirmed VAP in around 36% of individuals compared with around 50% of patients not receiving these probiotics, and the mean time to develop VAP was increased by almost 3 days. These findings suggest that seven patients need to be treated to prevent one episode of VAP. However, there was no effect on the incidence of clinically suspected VAP or length of hospital stay. All patients were also given standard preventive strategies (110851).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBacillus subtilis is an aerobic or facultative-anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacteria. It is found in soil and water and inhabits the gastrointestinal tract. B. subtilis is considered convenient for use as a probiotic because its spores are heat-stable and store easily (104231, 110808, 110834, 110842, 110847, 110848). Some strains of B. subtilis are used for the production of enzymes, such as bacillopeptidase F and nattokinase (12073, 12090, 110845).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHuman research shows that taking B. subtilis DE111 increases the population of anti-inflammatory immune cells. However, there was no effect on blood markers of inflammation (110846).\nCardiovascular effects\nB. subtilis is of interest for cardiovascular health. Beneficial effects of B. subtilis on plasma lipids have been shown in human and animal research. Some clinical research shows that taking B. subtilis DE111 for 4 weeks modestly improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over baseline (110808). However, other research in humans does not agree with these findings (110841, 110859).\nGastrointestinal effects\nB. subtilis is of interest for gastrointestinal health, such as the prevention and treatment of diarrhea. Some clinical research in adults shows that taking B. subtilis decreases the frequency of loose stools (110836). The mechanism of action may be related to the probiotic effects of B. subtilis. Human research has shown that some strains of B. subtilis remain viable in the gastrointestinal tract (110848). Other human research shows that B. subtilis may alter the diversity of gut microbiota and affect levels of certain genera that play a role in bowel frequency (110386, 110863, 110864). Other research shows that B. subtilis increases levels of deconjugated bile acid in plasma (110859). Also, B. subtilis seems to alter levels of some amino acids, bile salts, polyphenols, and neurotransmitters in the small intestine within 4 hours of intake (110864). However, other human research does not show that B. subtilis affects the general microbiota, production of short chain fatty acids, fecal markers of inflammation, or gut barrier function (110841, 110846).\n\nB. subtilis is also of interest for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection. In an animal model, B. subtilis PXN21 spores do not reduce the colonization of C. difficile. However, they improve symptoms of the infection and increase survival. The most evidence of benefit was related to treatment post-, as opposed to pre-C. difficile infection. The mechanism of action may include the role of innate immunity induced by B. subtilis following the formation of its vegetative cell in the colon (110839)."

It is unclear if oral bacopa is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nA small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment shows that taking bacopa 300 mg daily for 12 months does not improve measures of cognitive function or memory when compared with donepezil or baseline measures (109623).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral bacopa is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nA small clinical study in boys 6-14 years of age with symptoms consistent with ADHD but without an official diagnosis shows that taking a specific bacopa supplement (KeenMind - CDRI 08, Flordis) for 14 weeks does not improve symptoms of ADHD but improves some cognitive outcomes including error-making, cognitive flexibility, executive functioning, and sleep when compared with placebo. Bacopa 160 mg was given once daily in those weighing 20-35 kg and twice daily in those over 35 kg (109625). However, another small, open-label study in children aged 6-12 years with ADHD shows that taking a different bacopa supplement (BacoMind, Natural Remedies), 225 mg daily for 6 months, improves symptoms such as restlessness, impulsivity, learning problems, and attention deficit when compared to baseline (97603). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of blinding or comparator group.\nless\nBack pain. Although there is interest in using oral bacopa for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bacopa for this condition.\nCognitive function. Bacopa seems to improve some measures of cognitive function, but data are conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies, along with more recent clinical research, shows that taking bacopa 300-600 mg daily for at least 12 weeks is not associated with improved measures of cognition including working memory, learning rate, recognition of pictures and words, reaction time, or attention when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analysis of this meta-analysis and another small clinical study show some evidence of improved reaction times, verbal learning, total recall, retention, memory, and information processing in healthy adults when compared with placebo (10058, 17946, 33287, 97605, 109624, 111520).\n\nIn children aged 6-8 years old, a very small clinical study shows that taking a syrup containing bacopa extract 350 mg three times daily for 3 months improves visual motor function and immediate memory when compared to baseline (33304). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the placebo group.\n\nBacopa has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A study in healthy adults aged 18-60 years shows that taking a single dose of a combination of bacopa 300 mg, American ginseng 100 mg, and coffee fruit extract 100 mg (Bacognize) improves some measures of working memory and attention by a small amount at 45 minutes when compared with placebo (103375). It is unclear if these effects are due to bacopa, other ingredients, or the combination. In contrast, a moderate-sized study in healthy, middle-aged adults shows that taking a combination product containing whole plant bacopa 7.5 grams, gingko biloba, and group B vitamins for 12 weeks does not improve measures of memory, attention, cognition, mood, or stress reactivity when compared with placebo.

In one study, no detectable levels of the saponin glycosides were identified in the serum of patients taking bacopa daily for 12 weeks (109626).\nExcretion\nThe saponin glycosides of bacopa are excreted in the feces (109626).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of bacopa are the leaves and roots. The pharmacological activity of bacopa is attributed to various saponin glycosides, including the jujubogenin glycosides (bacopaside A3 and bacopaside X) and pseudojujubogenin glycosides (bacopaside I, bacopaside II, and bacopaside C) (10060, 10061, 33302, 33301, 33300, 33299, 97269, 103378, 109626). Aerial parts of bacopa contain betulinic acid, wogonin, and oroxindin (33292).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA study in mice with induced neuroinflammation suggests that giving a constituent of bacopa (i.e., bacopaside X) for 14 days modestly reduces mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1 beta, and interleukin 1 alpha when compared with control (112417).\nAntiepileptic effects\nIn animals, bacopa ethanolic extract increased cerebral levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 15 minutes after administration. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex and its deficit exacerbates epilepsy (33295).\nAntifungal effects\nThe bacopa constituents betulinic acid, wogonin, and oroxindin have shown antifungal activity in laboratory studies (33292).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome of bacopa's therapeutic effects could be attributed to antioxidant effects (10058, 33282, 97607). Bacopa seems to lower intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, which could also protect against cell death (17943, 17944, 33284). Some in vitro evidence also shows that bacopa extract can protect neuronal cells and connective tissue cells from oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide and acrolein, a by-product of lipid peroxidation (17944, 33291). Additionally, one laboratory study shows that an alcoholic bacopa extract increases levels of liver antioxidants and reduces oxidant effects caused by morphine administration in rats (33285).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn animal tissue models, bacopa appears to increase adaptation responses to stressors. It also normalizes corticosterone and monoamine levels in experimental models of stress (17946).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nIn vitro testing of a bacopa root extract and the isolated constituent bacoside in rat liver microsomes did not show clinically significant inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, or 3A4 (97269).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBacopa juice given with sucralfate seems to alleviate gastric ulcers induced by aspirin, pylorus ligation, and cold-restraint, but not ethanol, in rats (33283). Laboratory research also shows that bacopa extract has activity against Helicobacter pylori (33290). A study of mice induced with ulcerative colitis suggests that oral bacopa extract given for 7 days may attenuate disease severity scores measuring stool consistency, bleeding, and weight loss when compared with control. These effects appear to be from bacopa's saponin components (112418).\nImmunological effects\nBacopa may act as a mast cell stabilizer in allergic conditions (10060).\nMuscular effects\nBacopa ethanol extract appears to stop vascular and intestinal smooth muscle spasms by antagonizing calcium and acetylcholine (33281).\nNeurological effects\nSome evidence suggests bacosides A, B, X, and bacopa alcoholic extract may facilitate learning ability, memory, and cognitive performance (33298, 112417). Possible mechanisms for cognitive improvement include modulation of acetylcholine release, choline acetylase activity, muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding, and expression of mRNA markers associated with Alzheimer disease (10058, 33294, 112417). Due to these cholinergic effects, there is interest in using bacopa for Alzheimer disease. In vitro research shows that bacopa may protect neurons from beta-amyloid-induced cell death. This may be related to bacopa's inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (17943, 17943). In an animal model of Alzheimer disease, a bacopa extract increases measures of spatial memory (17945).\n\nLaboratory findings in clinical research also show that bacopa enhances cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, a key regulator of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, which is instrumental in learning and memory (111520).\nThyroid effects\nAnimal research suggests that bacopa increases thyroxine (T4) levels in mice by about 40% (33286)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of bael are the unripe fruit, seed, root, leaf, and bark. Constituents of the plant include carotenoids, alkaloids, furanocoumarins, flavonoids, terpenoids, and tannins. The main furanocoumarins in the fruit are marmelosin, marmesinin, and 8-hydroxypsoralen. Other constituents of the fruit include imperatorin and the alkaloid aegeline (99295, 99296, 99297, 99300). The leaves contain aegeline, betulinic acid, marmenol, montanine, and scopoletin (33314, 33327, 33329). The leaf essential oil contained limonene, alpha-phellandrene, beta-ocimene, alpha-pinene, caryophyllene, beta-elemene, and germacrene B (99902). The seeds contain coumarins, including luvangetin (33332).\nAnti-asthma effects\nBael is a traditional treatment for asthma. Bael extract appears to antagonize the contractile effects of histamine in the trachea using an isolated organ bath method (33320). In animal models, imperatorin, a constituent of bael, inhibited inflammatory processes in a rat allergic asthma model (99299).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBael is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. These have been shown in animal models (33318). In vitro, bael extract inhibits 5-lipoxygenase activity (99299). The constituent marmelosin inhibits the tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediated inflammatory pathway (99298).\nAntidiabetic effects\nVarious parts of the bael plant are used traditionally in the treatment of diabetes. The fruit, leaf, and seed extracts have glucose lowering effects in animal models of diabetes (33312, 33316, 33323, 33324, 33325, 33328, 33329). In vitro, bael extract increases glucose uptake into muscle cells (33324). In animal models, bael extracts increases insulin levels and reverses oxidative damage to the insulin-producing pancreatic islets (33316, 33323, 33328). Constituents of interest include the coumarins (33312). Leaves contain aegeline, a constituent that has hypoglycemic effects (33329).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nBael unripe fruit is traditionally used for diarrhea. Animal research suggests that the unripe fruit has antidiarrheal effects (33310, 33334). In vitro, the fruit extract has microbicidal effects against Giardia and rotovirus. Furthermore, although the extract does not have direct antibacterial effects, it appears to prevent bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and the production and activity of some enterotoxins (99297). Bael is also stated to have digestive and astringent properties (18).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, the essential oil isolated from the leaves exhibits variable antifungal activity and inhibits spore germination of fungi isolates (3832).\nAntiulcer effects\nBael is used for various gastrointestinal issues. In animal models, an extract of the unripe fruit has shown anti-ulcer effects, possibly related to its antioxidant effects (33334, 99295). Luvangetin, as an isolate from bael seeds, has anti-ulcer action in animal models (33332).\nNeurological effects\nBael is traditionally used for memory and intelligence. In vitro, bael leaf extract inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity (99296)."

There have been at least five published reports of liver damage associated with this product. In all cases, the patients were females aged 54-68 years taking doses of 250-500 mg twice daily for 1-3 months. Signs and symptoms included jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, fever, rash, and elevated serum bilirubin and liver transaminase levels. All patients fully recovered and levels normalized within 3 months after discontinuation (18009, 96282). In addition to these published case reports, approximately 30 liver-related adverse events have been reported to the manufacturer of this product (18009).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Baikal skullcap.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking tablets containing baicalein, a constituent of Baikal skullcap, 600 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 6 days results in a maximum concentration of 1323 ng/mL and a time to maximum concentration of approximately 2 hours (110023). Taking baicalein with food appears to increase the maximum plasma concentration of baicalein, but does not affect the overall exposure to baicalein (105868).\nDistribution\nAfter oral administration of Baikal skullcap root in rats, free forms of baicalein and wogonin, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, appear in the liver, kidney, and lung (33464). Some in vitro research also suggests that baicalein is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, as well as gut epithelium (33409).\nExcretion\nBaikal skullcap constituents and their metabolites are primarily excreted in urine (33352, 33355, 33496). Baicalein-6-O-beta-glucopyranuronoside, 6-O-methyl-baicalin-7-O-beta-glucopyranuronoside, and baicalin are detected in urine following oral administration of baicalin (33355). The serum half-life of baicalein, a constituent of Baikal skullcap, is approximately 9-15 hours (105868, 110023).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Baikal skullcap are the root and, to a lesser extent, the above ground parts. Most pharmacological activity has been attributed to flavonoid constituents, including baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, and scutellarein (33356, 33375, 33417, 33431, 33448, 33470).\nAnti-allergy effects\nBaikal skullcap is traditionally used to treat allergy symptoms. In vitro research suggests that baicalin from Baikal skullcap inhibits the release of histamine and leukotriene from mast cells (33445).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMany of the clinical effects of Baikal skullcap are thought to be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Some in vitro research suggests that Baikal skullcap and its constituents may have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, based on the modulating effects of cytokines (interleukins and interferons), eicosanoids, nitric oxide, and other inflammatory mediators (5541, 12847, 12848, 17031, 33344, 33347, 33378, 33432, 33439, 33459, 33487, 33498).\nAnticancer effects\nBaikal skullcap is traditionally used for cancer, especially prostate cancer. Numerous animal and in vitro studies have evaluated the potential anticancer properties of Baikal skullcap and its constituents (5541, 6294, 33338, 33348, 33350, 33358, 33364, 33367, 33368, 33369)(33375, 33380, 33381, 33386, 33389, 33390, 33401, 33419, 33428, 33442)(33451, 33456, 33479, 33488, 33489, 33502, 92774, 92775). Potential mechanisms of action likely involve apoptosis via suppression of cellular events and inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids (33358, 33396, 33467, 33479, 33483, 33506, 92774). Additional in vitro research suggests that Baikal skullcap may have antiangiogenic effects (33357, 33426). The antiangiogenic effects of Baikal skullcap may be due to toll-like receptor 4 signal transduction pathways (33426).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBaikal skullcap is of interest for diabetes. Human research shows that taking Baikal skullcap has a small effect on postprandial, but not fasting, glucose levels (101738). Animal research shows that the constituent baicalein inhibits alpha-glucosidase activity (6292). Also, the constituent baicalin reduces elevated insulin concentrations following a high-fat diet (33444). In vitro research suggests that baicalein inhibits intestinal sucrase (6292).\nAntiretroviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that Baikal skullcap inhibits the activity of the human immunodeficiency virus, by interfering with its entry into cells as well as its replication (5541, 33337, 33340, 33492).\nGenitourinary effects\nSome animal research shows that oroxylin A, a constituent of Baikal skullcap root, produces relaxation of the rat uterus (33420).\nHematologic effects\nThere is interest in using Baikal skullcap to treat Peyronie disease. Some researchers have suggested that a constituent of Baikal skullcap, wogonin, inhibits cell proliferation and downregulates the profibrotic factor monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). Preliminary observational research in adults with Peyronie disease has found that taking Baikal skullcap extract 150 mL twice daily is associated with reduced plaque volume and curvature when compared with no treatment (105867).\nImmune effects\nBaikal skullcap is traditionally used for various types of infections. In vitro research suggests that constituents of Baikal skullcap have varying effects on immune mediators suggesting the potential for changes in activity and proliferation of cells involved in the immune response (33344, 33414, 33443). Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy adults receiving a quadrivalent influenza vaccine shows that taking a supplement containing extracts of Baikal skullcap and catechu twice daily for 56 days (starting 28 days before vaccination) modestly increases the overall immunoglobulin response to vaccination, but does not improve the levels of influenza-A or influenza-B specific antibodies or lymphocyte response when compared with placebo (112175).\nLipid effects\nBaikal skullcap is of interest for atherosclerosis. Some animal research shows that Baikal skullcap significantly reduces serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apo B concentrations; increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apo AI levels (33363, 33410).\nNeuroprotective effects\nBaikal skullcap is traditionally used for seizures, psychiatric disorders, and anxiety. Although the mechanism of action is not known, Baikal skullcap has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in laboratory research, possibly through antioxidant mechanisms (33413, 33423, 33473, 33505).\nProstate effects\nBaikal skullcap is traditionally used for prostate cancer and as an anti-inflammatory agent. In an animal model of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Baikal skullcap inhibited inflammation and proliferation of cells possibly by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase (101740).\nSedative effects\nBaikal skullcap is thought to have sedative effects. In vitro research suggests that flavonoids from Baikal skullcap bind to GABA-A receptors with possible benzodiazepine-like effects (6290, 6291)."

Approximately 97% of the cyanide is removed by boiling for 2.5-3 hours at 98-102oC. Superheated steam drying or fermentation is also used to reduce cyanide levels (96874). Bamboo shoots are eaten like other vegetables and are a source of protein, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins E and C (96875).\nAnti-cancer effects\nSome preliminary laboratory research suggests that bamboo leaf extract causes apoptosis of cancer cells (33533, 33536).\nThyroid effects\nIn laboratory and animal research, bamboo extracts inhibited activity of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase.

            "Overview": "Bananas are fruiting plants that commonly grow on the margins of tropical rainforests. There is a large diversity of banana species, with many natural hybrids. Common cultivated bananas, eaten as dessert bananas or sweet bananas, are hybrids of Musa acuminata. Plantains, or cooking bananas, are hybrids of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana (93772, 93773, 93775, 93776, 93800). All parts of the banana plant, including the roots, stems, pseudostems, leaves, fruit, and flowers, have been used in traditional medicine in various cultures worldwide (93773, 93775).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used in the amounts commonly found in food.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when the leaves are applied topically and appropriately (93456).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of the other parts of the banana plant when used orally or topically as a medicine.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using amounts greater than those found in food.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, bananas are well tolerated when consumed as food.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, cramping, gas.\n\nTopically: Urticaria.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Anaphylaxis, intestinal obstruction.\nEndocrine\nIn one case report, an adolescent girl who consumed nothing other than 20 bananas daily developed hyperkalemia and hyperdopaminemia. These changes in the blood resulted in pseudoaldosteronism and dysthymia (93780).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, banana starch isolated from green bananas has resulted in bloating, gas, cramping, and softer feces (93448, 93449, 110619). When consumed prior to exercise, fullness and bloating during exercise have been reported (93459). In children, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension have been reported when banana is used in the treatment of diarrhea (93461). Cases of intestinal obstruction due to banana seeds have been reported (93777).\n\nIn one case report, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) has been associated with banana consumption (93778).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, banana has been reported to cause allergic reaction, including urticaria and redness, abdominal pain and nausea, dyspnea (93779, 93781, 93782, 93797, 93798, 93803), and anaphylaxis (93783, 93793, 93802, 93803). Topically, contact urticara has also been reported (93784). Skin testing is not always accurate, even for patients with severe banana allergy (93793).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, high banana consumption has been associated with a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms in females, but not males, in a cross-sectional study of the general Chinese adult population (106471).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiarrhea. Low-quality evidence shows that oral cooked green bananas might be helpful for the management of acute and persistent diarrhea due to various causes in children. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for treatment of diarrhea in adults.\nA meta-analysis of nine blinded or open label clinical studies in children aged 8 to 34 months with acute and persistent diarrhea shows that consuming cooked green bananas along with standard treatment, such as fluids, for 1 to 14 days increases rates of resolution for acute and persistent diarrhea when compared with control. Furthermore, consuming green banana increases the likelihood of diarrhea resolution by day 3 and reduces the risk of dehydration and related complications when compared with control (115475). Several clinical trials used cooked green bananas 50-100 grams per day in children aged 6-12 months, 100-200 grams per day in children aged 12-24 months, and 300 grams per day aged 24 months to 5 years (93451, 93462, 93463, 106469, 115475).\n\nA moderate size, open label clinical study among children aged 6-35 months hospitalized with persistent diarrhea in Bangladesh shows that consuming a diet of green banana mixed with rice suji increases the number of children who recover within 5 days when compared with a full-strength rice suji diet but is equivalent to the standard treatment (control) of 75% strength rice suji diet (112150). Duration of hospital stay is also similar with green banana and 75% strength rice suji and shorter than with full strength rice suji. There is also less relapse at home among children who had been given the green banana rice suji diet in hospital compared with the 75%-strength rice suji. The validity of the study is limited by the lack of blinding.\n\nClinical research also shows that bananas might be beneficial for diarrhea associated with enteral feeding in adults with critical illness. Adding banana flakes (Kanana Banana, Corpak Co) 1-3 tablespoons every 8 hours to the feeding tube seems to be as effective as routine medical treatment involving feeding rate adjustments and use of antidiarrheal agents for reducing symptoms and duration of diarrhea. After 7 days of treatment, 57% of patients in the banana group were free of diarrhea compared with only 24% of patients in the group receiving routine treatment (93453).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral banana flower for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral banana is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in trained male cyclists shows that consuming 0.4 grams/kg carbohydrate orally from ripe bananas with water 10-20 minutes prior to a 75 km cycling time trial, and 0.15-0.2 grams/kg carbohydrate from bananas with water every 15 minutes during the trial, modestly improves cycling time and oxygen consumption when compared with water alone. This regimen is equally effective to the same dose of carbohydrate from a 6% carbohydrate beverage (Gatorade) (93459, 93465). However, another study from the same group of researchers found conflicting results with the use of carbohydrates from banana for this purpose (100995). It is possible that the consumption of carbohydrates in general, not the use of bananas specifically, is beneficial for athletic performance. However, other preliminary clinical research in trained male runners shows that consuming a banana and drinking plain water does not improve the time to run 10 km on a treadmill when compared with plain water alone. No benefit was seen with the consumption of other carbohydrate drinks when compared with plain water; it is possible that the duration of exercise was too short to identify an improvement in performance (93457). Further research is needed to clarify the benefits of banana, if any, for athletic performance.\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if topical banana leaf is beneficial in patients with burns.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults and children with partial thickness burns shows that daily changes of a banana leaf dressing with povidone iodine reduces pain during dressing changes. Furthermore, wound healing is as effective as a boiled potato peel bandage with povidone iodine, with no increased need for skin grafting (93454). When compared with Vaseline gauze dressing for 8 days following skin graft treatment for burns in adults, banana leaf dressing increases speed of epithelization from 11.7 days to 8.7 days, and improves average pain, pain during dressing removal, and ease of dressing removal. By the 8th day, complete epithelization was present in 57% of the wounds dressed with banana leaves when compared with 0% of the wounds dressed with Vaseline gauze (93455).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using topical banana green fruit for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral green banana is beneficial in patients with constipation.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with functional constipation shows that consuming cooked green bananas, 30 grams daily for 8 weeks, improves stool consistency and abdominal pain and reduces straining and pain during defecation when compared with baseline. Consuming cooked green bananas with a conventional laxative such as polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes or sodium picosulfate also appears to decrease the dose of laxative needed in these children when compared with baseline (100996). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nContraception. Although there has been interest in using oral banana root for contraception, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nCough. Although there has been interest in using oral banana flower for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral banana is beneficial in patients with depression.\nA large cross-sectional study in the general Chinese adult population has found that moderate, but not high, banana consumption is associated with a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms in males. However, high banana consumption is associated with a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms in females (106471).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral banana starch is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking banana starch 24-57.2 grams orally daily for 4-28 days does not improve serum glucose levels, glucose variability, glucose control scores, or insulin levels when compared with control starches (110619, 93448).Other preliminary clinical research in obese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking banana starch 24 grams in 240 mL of water each day for 4 weeks reduces body weight when compared with a taking soymilk powder in water. However, banana starch did not improve lipid levels or body fat (93448). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking desiccated banana 250 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve lipid levels or glycemic response when compared to baseline (93452).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral banana is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nPreliminary clinical research in trained cyclists shows that consuming 0.4 grams/kg of carbohydrates orally from mini-yellow bananas with water 20 minutes prior to a 75 km cycling time trial, and 0.2 grams/kg of carbohydrates from banana every 15 minutes during the trial, decreases muscle soreness ratings 1.5 hours after the time trial when compared with water alone. Consuming carbohydrates from Cavendish bananas in the same manner did not decrease delayed onset muscle soreness, although cyclists reported less muscle cramping with both types of bananas when compared with water (100995). It is unclear whether carbohydrates from banana are any more effective than other carbohydrate sources or whether these results are generalizable to other types of exercise.\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for GERD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nHangover. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for hangover, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using topical banana leaves for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral banana is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking desiccated banana 500 grams orally daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of total cholesterol by 7.5% when compared with baseline in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Taking 250 grams daily does not seem to reduce total cholesterol levels; however, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels increase by 14.5% (93452). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nHypokalemia. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for hypokalemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nJoint pain. Although there has been interest in using oral banana flower for joint pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral banana stem has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with calculi of at least 5 mm shows that taking a specific Ayurvedic product (Herbmed) containing banana stem 250 mg and Crateva nurvala 250 mg orally daily for 3 months moderately improves symptoms associated with urinary calculi and reduces the size of the calculi by 11% to 33% when compared with baseline (93460). It is not clear if this is due to banana stem, Crateva nurvala, or the combination. Also, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMenorrhagia. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for menorrhagia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral banana is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research in obese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking banana starch 24 grams in 240 mL of water orally each day for 4 weeks reduces body weight by 1 kg more when compared to a control group consuming soymilk powder in water (93448).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nShigellosis. It is unclear if oral green banana is beneficial in patients with shigellosis.\nClinical research in children 6-60 months of age who are being treated with antibiotics for shigellosis shows that eating cooked green banana 250 grams per liter of a rice-based diet for 5 days improves symptoms of diarrhea, including the presence of fecal mucus and blood, when compared with a rice-based diet alone. Adding banana to the diet decreased the number of daily stools by 70% in those consuming banana compared to 50% in children consuming the rice diet alone (93461).\nless\nSkin grafts. Although there has been interest in using topical banana leaves for skin grafts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nSmoking cessation. Although there has been interest in using oral banana fruit for smoking cessation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of banana for this purpose.\nStroke.

Plasma levels of fructose and 2-isopropylmalic acid also increase (93459).\nDistribution\nAlthough the dopamine in bananas is absorbed, the blood-brain-barrier prevents passage to the brain after oral consumption (93459).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, sulfated derivatives of the banana constituents ferulic acid and eugenol are found in the blood following oral consumption of bananas. The serotonin breakdown product 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is also elevated (93459).\nExcretion\nIn humans, the ingestion of bananas results in increased urinary excretion of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (93775).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAll parts of the banana plant are used medicinally. These include the ripe and unripe fruit, both the stem and pseudostem, as well as the flower, leap, sap, inner trunk, inner core, and root (93773, 93775).\n\nThe major constituents of banana depend on the variety. These include catecholamines (93775, 93776), phytosterols (93776), and carotenoids, such as beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lutein. The levels of carotenoids are higher in the more colored varieties of bananas. Common bananas in Western countries are low in pro-vitamin A carotenoids (93775, 93776, 93795). Some types of bananas are high in phenolics, especially flavonoids (93775, 93776).\n\nBananas are high in starch, especially when unripe (93775, 93796). Bananas contain fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and carbohydrates, mainly as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, (93465). The soluble fiber levels of bananas are higher when the banana is ripe. An unripe banana has much higher levels of insoluble fiber (93452). The amount of resistant starch varies with different varieties of banana (93796).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nExtracts and constituents of banana have shown anti-inflammatory effects in various laboratory models and in human research. Constituents appear to inhibit cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide and impact levels of cytokines. In animal research, an extract of the flowering stalk or peel decreased pain and inflammation (93773).\nAntibacterial effects\nExtracts of various parts of the banana plant, including the corm, leaf, flower, peel, fruit, and leaves, have antibacterial effects against a wide range of Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria (93773).\nAnticancer effects\nGreen banana is traditionally used for cancer. Extracts of the fruit pulp, peel, flower, and other parts of the plant have shown anti-cancer effects in laboratory research (93773).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBanana is traditionally used for diabetes. Banana fruit has a low to moderate glycemic load (93796). Banana fruit extract has shown hypoglycemic effects in animal diabetic models (93773). However, in patients with diabetes, banana starch or desiccated banana do not appear to successfully lower blood glucose levels (93448, 93452). Clinical research in adults with glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes shows that consuming banana starch daily for 4 days to 8 weeks does not improve glucose tolerance or blood glucose levels (93449, 93450). However, consuming banana starch might improve homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores by 32%, which is similar to the 25% improvement seen with metformin (93450).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome of the general health effects of banana are thought to be associated with its antioxidant effects. Banana contains numerous constituents that have the potential to act as antioxidants. Banana leaves, pulp, and peel have shown antioxidant effects in laboratory and human research (93773, 93776). In humans, banana has increased antioxidant capacity during exercise (93459).\nExercise performance effects\nIn human research, banana reduces levels of cortisol and inflammatory cytokines associated with exercise while also decreasing the expression of cyclooxygenase-2. It is possible that this decreased inflammation results in better recovery (93459, 100995).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBanana is commonly used in the treatment of diarrhea due to its amylase-resistant starch content (93448, 93461). Resistant starch is thought to result in increased production of fatty acids in the colon and delayed transit time. In human research, green banana results in increased levels of short chain fatty acids in the colon. This change was associated with a decrease in inflammatory cells in the feces and decreased myeloperoxidase activity (93461). The short chain fatty acids may also stimulate salt and water absorption in the large intestine, thereby reducing stool volume and providing energy for large intestinal mucosal growth or repair which could help in the management of persistent diarrhea (112150). Also, human research suggests that green banana decreases intestinal permeability (93462).\n\nBanana is also used traditionally for gastric ulcers. In animal models, extracts of the pseudostem, peel, and pulp inhibited ulceration and reduced hemorrhage, edema, and congestion. The peel appears to be more effective than the pulp for this purpose (93373).\n\nThere is some evidence that eating banana might increase levels of Bifidobacterium in feces, which suggests prebiotic activity (93799).\n\nBanana is also of interest as a prebiotic for mitigating the accumulation of gut microbiome-derived uremic toxins that can accumulate in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, a small clinical study in adults with chronic kidney disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis shows that daily consumption of unripe banana flour for 4 weeks does not affect total or free serum levels of the uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, or indole 3-acetic acid (106470).\nHypotensive effects\nIn a human model of cold-stress induced hypertension, eating one banana prevented an increase in blood pressure. This was likely due to the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (93801).\nImmune effects\nIn laboratory research, banana extracts have been shown to induce activity of macrophages. In animal research, banana extracts are associated with increased numbers and activity of immune cells and changes in the production of cytokines (93373).\nWeight loss effects\nBananas are commonly used to aid in weight loss. In human research, the evidence related to weight loss and glycemic control is mixed (93448, 93449, 93450). Bananas might have satiating effects (93794). A small study in overweight and obese females shows that consumption of a beverage containing unripe banana flour and cocoa with breakfast daily for 6 weeks is associated with reductions in waist circumference, waist-height ratio, and body fat percentage when compared with baseline (106468)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of baobab are the leaf, fruit, seed, root, stem, and bark (102138). The fruit and leaves are rich sources of nutrients and are used as food (17647, 106330).The protein content of the fruit is approximately 170 mg/gram and the content of the leaves is 112 mg/gram (17640). Baobab fruit is also a relatively rich source of essential fatty acids, providing approximately 84 mg/gram. Of these, linoleic acid makes up about 27 mg/gram (17640). Baobab seed oil is also a good source of fatty acids. It contains about 31.7% saturated fatty acids including palmitic acid, 37% monounsaturated fatty acids including oleic acid, and 31.7% polyunsaturated fatty acids including linolenic acid (17643). Baobab leaves contain 60% to 70% carbohydrate, 13% to 15% protein, 11% fiber, and 4% to 10% fat (102137).\n\nBaobab fruit and leaves contain calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and manganese (17640, 17643, 17647, 102137, 106330). The fruit powder contains approximately 2-4 grams/kg of calcium and 0.4-4.5 grams/kg of phosphorus. Dried baobab leaf contains approximately 15-18 grams/kg of calcium and 1.5-2 grams/kg of phosphorus (17639, 17640). Baobab fruit and leaves are also a significant source of vitamin C (17640, 17643, 17647, 106330).\n\nBaobab leaves also contain flavonoids, triterpenoids, saponins, mucilage, steroids, tannin, and alkaloids (17749, 102137). The fruit contains phenols, proanthocyanins (epicatechin, quercetin, and others), hydrolysable tannins, phytic acid, trypsin inhibitors, oxalates, and hydrocyanic acid (108936).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn rats, an aqueous extract of baobab bark has analgesic properties against heat and chemical-induced pain (102138).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBaobab leaf extracts reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, in diabetic rats (102137).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a rat model of diabetes, administering a methanolic extract of baobab leaves orally for 6 weeks reduces blood levels of glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (102137). In healthy adults, taking a single dose of an aqueous extract of baobab fruit 33.25 mg reduces the postprandial glucose area under the concentration-time curve and the glucose maximum concentration after an oral glucose tolerance test when compared with no extract (108936).\nAntihypertensive effects\nIn an animal hypertensive model, baobab stem bark extract prevented the development of hypertension (106328).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, baobab extracts have relatively low activity against bacteria and fungi (17648). Baobab extracts have some in vitro activity against viruses including herpes simplex, Sindbis, and polio (17641, 17642).\nAntioxidant effects\nBaobab has antioxidant activity in vitro and in animal models (102137, 106328, 108396). The fruit pulp has greater antioxidant effects than the leaf (17647). Leaf extracts reduce lipid peroxidation and maintain cellular antioxidant enzymes in diabetic rats (102137). An aqueous extract of the fruit has high antioxidant activity in vitro, scavenging superoxide anions and nitric oxide radicals (108936).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn diabetic rats, a methanolic extract of baobab leaf reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (102137).\nMosquito repellant effects\nExtracts of baobab leaves have larvicidal and repellent activity against Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (17749)."

Excessive amounts of barley sprouts should not be consumed during pregnancy (19).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, barley is well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal distension, bloating, flatulence, unpleasant taste. Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.\n\nTopically: Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.\nDermatologic\nTopically, barley malt contained in beer has been reported to cause contact dermatitis (33762). After occupational exposure, barley has been reported to cause contact dermatitis of the eyelids and extremities, as well as contact urticaria (33735, 33770, 33774).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nWhen consumed orally, barley provides fiber. Increasing fiber in the diet can cause flatulence, bloating, abdominal distention, and unpleasant taste. To minimize side effects, doses should be slowly titrated to the desired level. Adverse effects usually subside with continued use (12514).\n\nBarley contains gluten. In patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease, consuming barley can cause gastrointestinal upset and impairment of xylose excretion (33763, 33772).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, consumption of beer has been reported to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals (33722, 33724). Symptoms included tingling in the face, lip, and tongue, angioedema, generalized urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, cough, fainting, and rhinoconjunctivitis. It can also cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals (317). Topically and with occupational exposure, barley has been reported to cause contact dermatitis and rash (33762, 33735, 33770, 33774).\n\n\"Bakers' asthma\" is an allergic response resulting from the inhalation of cereal flours by workers in the baking and milling industries, and has been reported to occur after barley flour exposure (1300, 33756, 33760). Cross-allergenicity has been shown to exist between different cereals (33758).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\n\"Bakers' asthma\" is an allergic response resulting from the inhalation of cereal flours by workers in the baking and milling industries, and has been reported to occur after barley flour exposure (1300, 33756, 33760). Cross-allergenicity has been shown to exist between different cereals (33758).\n\nBy inhalation, barley flours may be a source of allergens in asthma (33764, 33773). Inhalation of wild barley grass pollen may result in bronchial irritation or pneumonitis (33726, 33755).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Consuming barley 3-3.6 grams daily as a source of dietary fiber appears to reduce the risk of CHD.\nClinical research shows that a diet containing foods high in soluble fiber, such as whole grain barley or dry milled barley, reduces the risk of heart disease (2737, 4962, 4963, 4964, 4965, 4966, 4967, 4968). In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a health claim stating that consuming at least 3 grams of soluble fiber per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD (5792, 5797, 102336). However, some clinical research shows that at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber daily is needed to reduce the risk of CHD (5788, 5795).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Consuming barley 3-12 grams daily seems to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in adults with hypercholesterolemia.\nClinical research shows that taking barley significantly reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when used with a normal diet or added to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step I diet (11134, 11986, 17129, 33734, 33748, 33752). A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that consuming preparations containing barley 3-12 grams daily for at least 4-12 weeks reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels by around 12 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL, respectively, with no change in triglyceride or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. These changes did not appear to be dose-dependent (17129). However, a small clinical study in males with hypercholesterolemia shows that the effect of barley on cholesterol is modestly dose-dependent. Taking 0.4 grams, 3 grams, or 6 grams of soluble fiber from barley daily for 5 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 14%, 17%, and 20%, respectively, and reduces LDL cholesterol by 17%, 17%, and 24%, respectively, when compared to baseline (11986).\n\nThe form of barley used may alter its effect on cholesterol levels. Some research has shown that barley highly enriched (75% by weight) with beta-glucans does not seem to significantly affect cholesterol. This lack of effect seems to be the result of processing the barley into a highly enriched beta-glucans product (10166). Food processing seems to affect beta-glucans structure or solubility and therefore decreases the cholesterol lowering effects of barley.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nColorectal cancer. Increased consumption of barley as a source of fiber does not appear to be beneficial for primary or secondary prevention of colorectal cancer.\nClinical and observational research shows that consuming dietary cereal fiber, including barley fiber, does not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer or prevent colorectal cancer recurrence (160, 4819, 4820, 4821, 5104).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral barley is beneficial in patients with COVID-19.\nA small clinical study in Iranian adults hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 shows that drinking 250 mL of Persian barley water daily for 2 weeks, along with conventional treatment, decreases length of hospital stay, body temperature, and markers of inflammation when compared with conventional treatment alone. However, Persian barley water does not appear to improve oxygen saturation or symptoms of COVID-19 (111148). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control and concerns related to the statistical methods used.\nless\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral barley for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of barley for this purpose.\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral barley for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of barley for this purpose.\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral barley is effective for the prevention of gastric cancer.\nObservational research suggests that increased consumption of dietary fiber, a component of barley, is associated with 70% lower odds of gastric cancer when compared with low consumption of dietary fiber (10435).\nless\nGastritis. Although there has been interest in using oral barley for gastritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of barley for this purpose.\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral barley for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of barley for this purpose.\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral barley for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of barley for this purpose.\nUlcerative colitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral barley might improve symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.\nSeveral small, open-label trials in patients with ulcerative colitis show that consuming food containing germinated barley 20-30 grams daily for 4-24 weeks reduces symptoms of ulcerative colitis when compared to baseline (33725, 33729, 33732, 33777). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of comparator groups.\n\nBarley has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement (Profermin, Nordisk Rebalance) containing barley malt flour, oat flour, Lactobacillus plantarum, and lecithin twice daily for 8 weeks decreases symptom scores by at least 50% in an additional 26% of patients when compared with a control nutritional supplement. Disease remission occurred in 31% of patients taking this product compared with 15% of patients in the control group (92818). It is unclear if these findings are due to barley, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate barley for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with barley.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBarley contains greater amounts of soluble and nonsoluble starches compared to other cereals, and approximately 17% of the carbohydrate in barley is not absorbed. This leads to fermentation in the colon by microflora, which is measurable by the H2 breath test (33768).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of barley are the grain and the grass. Barley contains 3% to 11% beta-glucans, a soluble fiber (10166, 17129, 92817, 101020). Barley contains varying amounts of total tocopherols and tocotrienols (49.9-67.6 mg/kg) and vitamin E content (vitamin E equivalent: 15.7-20.1 mg/kg) (33739). It also contains hordenine and lunasin (11136, 33736).\nAnticarcinogenic effects\nBarley is of interest in the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers, such as gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. In vitro, young green barley inhibited the proliferation, and induced cell death, of colon cancer cells (101020). Also, laboratory research suggests that lunasin, a peptide found in barley, may have anticarcinogenic properties (33736).\nAppetite effects\nThere is interest in using barley to decrease appetite. It contains beta-glucans, which lead to satiation by increasing gastric distension and delaying gastric emptying. Beta-glucans also slow the glycemic response, and may affect circulating levels of appetite-related hormones (11135, 33766, 92817). A small clinical study in healthy Japanese females shows that consuming white rice with high beta-glucans barley increases fullness and decreases hunger and subsequent energy consumption when compared with white rice alone (92817). Another small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming barley bread 73 grams decreases appetite rating scores but does not reduce subsequent food intake when compared with white bread, whole wheat bread, and oat bread (111147).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn preliminary clinical research in patients without hypertension, a diet of wheat and rice and a half-wheat-rice/half-barley diet, decreased systolic blood pressure (33741). Several mechanisms have been proposed for blood pressure reduction, including an increase in electrolyte and water excretion, alteration of gastric emptying time, and an increase in fecal mineral loss (11463).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGerminated barley foodstuff (GBF) is derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley. GBF appears to induce proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate defecation through bacterial production of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate. GBF is believed to facilitate epithelial repair and has been associated with increased growth of microflora in the intestinal tract (33725, 33778). Because of this, there is interest in using barley for ulcerative colitis (92818).\nGlucose effects\nBarley may contain more fermentable carbohydrates than other cereals, such as rice. Fermentation of undigested carbohydrates produces short-chain fatty acids, some of which may reduce hepatic glucose production and affect postprandial glycemia (33768). Because of the viscous properties of beta-glucans, boiled flours appear to produce higher glucose and insulin responses when compared with milled kernels (33766). Clinical research in healthy men shows that ingesting barley beta-glucans can decrease glycemic and insulinemic responses when given with high-carbohydrate food (33744). Also, in healthy subjects, bread or cereal made with barley or rye kernel lowered blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) when compared with white or wheat bread (33742, 33749, 111147). Barley also appears to improve glucose tolerance and lower inflammatory markers after a standardized breakfast in healthy individuals (33750). In an obese animal model, barley intake reduced levels of plasma insulin and resistin, both of which are involved in glucose control (101022).\nLipid effects\nThere is interest in using barley to reduce cholesterol. The fiber content of barley is likely responsible for the observed reduction of cholesterol levels in healthy and hypercholesterolemic people (11134). Clinical research shows that soluble fiber such as barley might increase the excretion of bile acids or neutral sterols (cholesterol precursors), increase catabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and reduce fat absorption (11986). In clinical, animal, and laboratory research, barley use has been associated with decreased total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, and may act additively with other cholesterol-lowering agents (10166, 11134, 33747, 33752, 33759, 33771). The plasma lipid-lowering effects of barley have been attributed to rich amounts of beta-glucans (33728, 33746, 33752).\n\nTwo barley products, barley oil and brewer's spent grains (BSG), neither of which contains soluble fiber, have been investigated for their potential positive impact on lipid metabolism. Brewer's spent grains (BSG) is a by-product of the brewing industry; it typically contains 98% insoluble dietary fiber and is high in protein (20-30%) and lipid (6-10%) and contains three times more tocotrienols than the whole grain. The combined animal and human studies on barley oil and brewer's spent grains suggest that some components, possibly the tocotrienols, affect lipid-controlling enzymes and lower cholesterol (11134). Other contributory factors may be d-alpha-tocotrienol (33757). In animals, high-protein barley flour (HPBF)-based diets increased body weight, suppressed HMG-CoA reductase, impaired fatty acid synthetase, and decreased serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels (33759).\nPrebiotic effects\nBarley is a source of soluble fiber, which acts as a prebiotic in the human gut. In an animal obesity model, barley intake increased the growth of Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and other probiotic species involved in the degradation of fiber. These changes were associated with reduced levels of the short chain fatty acid succinic acid (101022).\nSympathomimetic effects\nHordenine, an aminophenol in the root of germinating barley, is a sympathomimetic. However, there have been no reports of stimulant effects in humans (1302, 11136).\nThermoregulatory effects\nThere is some evidence in humans that taking a traditional Japanese beverage containing roasted barley extract helps to regulate skin temperature in cold conditions. The effects of the roasted barley extract are possibly related to the constituent cyclo (D-Phe-L-Pro). In animal models, this compound affects vasodilation by a mechanism of action related to the endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway (101021)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of basil are the above ground plant parts. Basil is a rich source of vitamin C, carotenoids, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron (19, 76892). Basil leaves contain approximately 0.21% essential oil (95141). Basil leaf essential oil contains linalool, estragole (methyl chavicol), eugenol, methyl cinnamate, o-cymene, citral, alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, gamma-terpinene, cineole, menthol, rosmarinic acid, geraniol, and geranial, among other constituents. Levels of the different constituents vary depending on geography, genetics, growing conditions, processing, and extraction methods. Some varieties of basil oil contain as much as 85% estragole or as little as 8%. Basil oil that is low in estragole is generally higher in linalool content (2, 59567, 68661, 76786, 76794, 76796, 76799, 76806, 76811, 76832, 76848)(76864, 95141, 103622).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that basil has anti-inflammatory effects (76870, 76787). Potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of lipoxygenase activity (76787) and nitric oxide production (47806).\nAntimicrobial effects\nBasil extracts or essential oil have shown activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in laboratory research. Basil essential oil has also shown anti-fungal effects (95141).\nAntioxidant effects\nBasil extracts and essential oils have shown antioxidant and free-radical scavenging effects in human and laboratory research (30631, 30640, 31044, 49005, 67228, 68671, 71700, 76815, 76821, 76825)(76847, 76880, 76890). The antioxidant properties of basil have been shown to be influenced by environmental conditions, growing practices, and processing techniques (67350). The antioxidant capacity of dry basil has been shown to be lower than fresh basil (40694).\nAntiparasitic effects\nBasil essential oils and constituents have demonstrated antiparasitic effects against Trypanosoma and Giardia species (43479, 76850).\nAntiviral effects\nAntiviral effects of basil have been shown in laboratory research (59406, 76834). Constituents such as apigenin, linalool, and ursolic acid exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activity (76834).\nCancer-related effects\nBoth anti-cancer and cancer-promoting effects of basil constituents have been shown in laboratory research. The essential oil of basil contains up to 85% estragole (2) which has been shown to produce liver tumors in mice (11). The basil constituents ursolic acid, xanthomicrol, and nevadensin have demonstrated both cytotoxic and antineoplastic activities (11, 76857, 76891). Ursolic acid has been shown to inhibit cellular messaging in cancer cells resulting in apoptosis or inhibited proliferation (76857). Antioxidant effects could explain the anti-cancer effects reported with some basil constituents (68661, 76821).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBasil is popularly used for gastrointestinal concerns such as ulcers, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. Animal research shows that basil can prevent castor oil-induced diarrhea (76787). It has also been shown to protect against the development of ulcers in mice (76787, 76897, 100345). Basil appears to decrease the production of stomach acid and antagonize histamine receptors (76787, 76897). It also increases the gastric concentration of antioxidant molecules, as well as the anti-inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-4. These anti-ulcer effects are comparable to those seen with the use of prophylactic misoprostol (100345).\nHematologic effects\nThere is interest in using basil essential oil to stimulate the production of fetal hemoglobin in patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies. In vitro research shows that basil essential oil stimulates hemoglobin accumulation and gamma-globin mRNA expression to a greater extent than hydroxyurea. This effect seems to be due to the eugenol component of the essential oil, although the linalool and eucalyptol constituents might provide additive effects (100344).\nInsecticidal effects\nThe basil constituents methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, ocimene, cineole, and linalool have insecticidal activities (11). These constituents might be responsible for the insect repellant and insecticidal effects of basil. The insecticidal effects of basil and its constituents have been demonstrated against various species of moths, weevils, fruit flies, ticks, and mosquitos (31399, 46195, 59653, 72607, 76790, 76839, 76862, 76869, 76875, 76883, 76894)."

Bay leaf constituents include methyl eugenol, sesquiterpene lactones, monoterpenoids, megastigmane glucosides, catechins, proanthocyanidins, alkaloids, flavonols, flavones, and plant acids (11, 15571, 33793, 33815, 33825, 33828, 33838, 33850, 33854, 101765). Bay leaf essential oil constituents include eucalyptol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, sabinene, alpha-pinene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, beta-pinene, and methyl eugenol (109013).\nAllergic effects\nSesquiterpene lactones in bay leaf oil are reported to be responsible for allergic contact reactions with bay leaf (15571).\nAntibacterial effects\nBay leaf essential oil has bactericidal properties in vitro (11).\nAnticancer effects\nBay leaf is traditionally used for cancer. Bay leaf has been found to inhibit human tumor cell growth in laboratory research. This effect is thought to be related to the ability of bay leaf to inhibit intracellular signaling (33801, 33806, 33836, 33837, 33847). Active constituents might include the sesquiterpenes (33801, 33806). However, in an animal model of human papillomavirus (HPV)16-induced cancer, bay leaf extract does not protect against cutaneous lesions (101765).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBay leaf has been studied in patients with diabetes with some evidence of blood glucose-lowering effects (33849). Although the mechanism of action is not known, laboratory research suggests that bay leaf might modify the activity of insulin and reduce glucose transport (10813, 33804).\nAntifungal effects\nBay leaf essential oil has fungicidal effects in laboratory research. The constituent 1,8-cineole is possibly one of the active constituents (33809).\nAntiviral effects\nBay leaf is traditionally used for colds and other respiratory infections. In laboratory research, bay leaf essential oil inhibited herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (33839).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research in hypertensive rats shows that taking bay leaf extract 180 mg/kg orally daily for 7 days reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 19% to 22% when compared with baseline (109517).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research in healthy rats shows that consuming bay leaf essential oil 1 mcL/gram orally daily for 14 days reduces fecal Lactobacillus colonies, but not Bifidobacterium or Enterobacteriaceae colonies when compared with control. Taking bay leaf essential oil also decreased fecal levels of beta-glucosidase and increased fecal levels of beta-glucuronidase (109013).\nLipid-lowering effects\nAnimal research in healthy rats shows that consuming bay leaf essential oil 1 mcL/gram orally daily for 14 days reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with control (109013).\nNeurologic effects\nThe bay leaf constituent, methyl eugenol, has sedative and narcotic properties in animal models (11). The constituent cineol and eugenol also produce sedation and motor impairment in an animal convulsion model (33795)."

In a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), bee pollen extract altered the expression of genes associated with apoptosis in ovarian cysts, likely through antiestrogenic and antioxidant effects (105780).\nRenal effects\nAnimal research shows that bee pollen has protective effects against chemically-induced kidney damage. In rats with ethylene glycol-induced kidney damage, taking oral bee pollen extract 500 mg/kg reduces proteinuria and prevents acute kidney injury. Mechanisms include reducing calcium and phosphate excretion, tubular crystal deposits, congestion of the interstitium, and necrosis of the tubular epithelium. It also causes dilation of renal collecting ducts (109990). In this animal model of renal injury, bee pollen also increases urine volume and sodium and chloride excretion, while reducing potassium excretion (109990).\nWound healing effect\nEvidence from animal research suggests that applying ointment containing bee pollen extract can improve the time for burn wound healing. This effect has been attributed to the antibacterial activity of bee pollen, as well as its ability to promote the regeneration of damaged tissue (91985)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Bee venom is a colored liquid produced by glands associated with the sting apparatus of honeybees (96574). The use of bee venom for medicinal purposes is popular in parts of Asia, eastern Europe, and South America (96576).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when FDA-approved purified bee venom is given by subcutaneous injection by a trained medical professional (2619, 6070, 96572).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when applied using stings from live bees. Live bee stings have been safely administered under medical supervision in doses up to 20 bee stings three times weekly for up to 24 weeks (13222).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of bee venom when used topically or injected in combination with acupuncture.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used by subcutaneous injection by a trained medical professional. Significant adverse effects to fetus or mother have not been reported. However, some clinicians decrease maintenance dose by half during pregnancy (2619).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used by subcutaneous injection in high doses. High doses of bee venom can increase release of histamine, which can cause uterine contraction (2619); avoid using in high doses.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nPurified bee venom given subcutaneously by a trained medical professional is generally well tolerated when used for diagnosis or immunotherapy of bee sting allergy.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nParenterally: Dizziness, injection site erythema, itching, nausea and vomiting, swelling, tenderness, urticaria.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nParenterally: Anaphylaxis, asthma, chest pain or tightness, coagulation abnormalities, confusion, edema, hypotension, laryngeal edema, malaise, palpitations, respiratory distress, somnolence.\nCardiovascular\nCase reports have described stroke, and bradycardia associated with bee venom therapy (96576). Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include cardiac dysfunction, palpitations, hypotension, and chest pain or tightness (1343, 2619, 6070, 6078, 111472, 111474).\nless\nDermatologic\nLocal adverse effects of parenteral bee venom include erythema, swelling, numbness, pain, and tenderness at the injection site, itching, urticaria, and edema (1343, 13222, 102531). Bee stings have been associated with eosinophilic foreign body granuloma (111482), and bee venom acupuncture can cause dermatitis, contact urticaria, skin infection with Mycobacterium chelonae (11483), giant dermatofibroma, or chronic folliculitis (96576). A case report describes panniculitis associated with bee venom immunotherapy (96576).\nless\nHematologic\nBee venom therapy has been associated with coagulation abnormalities including intravascular hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (6046, 96576, 111474). Bee venom given with acupuncture can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (6046, 96576).\nless\nHepatic\nTwo case reports describe hepatotoxicity, including acute icteric hepatitis associated with bee venom acupuncture (96576). Another case report describes hepatitis B reactivation complicated by nephritic syndrome during bee venom immunotherapy (96576).\nless\nImmunologic\nImmune-mediated reactions associated with bee venom include rash, itching, generalized hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis, serum sickness reaction, and immune thrombocytopenia (2169,6074.6077,95899,96576,11470). Estimates of the rate of immunologic reactions to various forms of bee venom range from 0.025% to 29% (96576, 105770, 11470, 111475). They occur most frequently when doses are increased rapidly. Females and people with a c-KIT mutation may have more severe and frequent adverse effects (1343, 6077, 102533, 11470). Doses of bee venom associated with adverse effects vary from 0.1 to 2 mL, and anaphylaxis has occurred after 1-24 doses (11470).\n\nBee venom is also associated with autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and pemphigus vulgaris (96574, 111473). In a case report, a 68-year-old female developed Guillain-Barré syndrome with progressive quadriplegia ten days after receiving acupuncture with honeybee venom for pain (96573). In another case, a 64-year-old female developed pemphigus foliaceus, involving pruritic, erythematous, erosive skin lesions with crusting and plaques, after bee venom acupuncture twice weekly for 2 months. Immunoglobulin G was detected in the intercellular spaces between keratinocytes. Partial resolution occurred after 2 months of treatment with oral corticosteroids and azathioprine (111473).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nBee venom can cause rhabdomyolysis (111474). A 63-year-old female who received an accidental injection into the psoas muscle of 2 mL of normal saline containing bee venom diluted in a 1:2000 ratio, experienced severe burning pain at the injection site which persisted for 1 month, with imaging showing inflammation of the muscle. The pain gradually resolved over the following 5 months (11475).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nBee venom can cause pain, headache, somnolence, and confusion (1343, 2619, 6070, 6078, 96576, 111472). It has also been associated with a case of neuralgic amyotrophy (96576).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nBee venom has been associated with asthma, hyperventilation, respiratory distress, paralysis of respiratory muscles, and pulmonary or laryngeal edema (1343, 2619, 6070, 6078, 96576, 111474).\nless\nRenal\nBee venom immunotherapy has been associated with nephrotic syndrome, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis (96576, 111474). A case report describes a 50-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function who developed acute kidney injury with combined features of interstitial nephritis and tubular necrosis after being stung by more than 1000 bees. He made a full recovery over several weeks with intermittent hemodialysis (111474).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "LIKELY EFFECTIVE\nBee sting allergy. Subcutaneous use of bee venom seems to be effective for bee sting desensitization in patients with severe allergy to bee stings. Bee venom immunotherapy provides 98% to 99% protection from systemic reactions to bee stings. Once immunotherapy is stopped, the risk of a systemic reaction over the next 5 to 10 years is about 5% to 15% (6043, 6075, 6076). Bee venom is an FDA-approved subcutaneous injectable product for the treatment of severe allergies to bee stings (2619).\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Administering live bee stings in graduated doses up to 20 stings given three times weekly does not seem to improve multiples sclerosis. Treatment for 24 weeks does not seem to reduce gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI or improve fatigue, disability, or quality of life (13222).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nFrozen shoulder. A small clinical study in patients with frozen shoulder shows that receiving bee venom diluted 1:10,000 as injections into acupuncture points twice a week for 8 weeks, as an adjunct to other therapy, improves pain and disability but not range of motion when compared with injection with normal saline. Bee venom injections diluted to 1:30,000 did not improve pain and disability when compared with placebo (96573). One year after receiving bee venom acupuncture, scores on the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index remained improved over placebo in these patients; however, verbal rating scale scores did not differ from placebo (105772).\nHemiplegic shoulder pain. Pooled analyses of two small clinical studies shows that bee venom acupuncture modestly decreases pain, but does not affect motor function, when compared with control in patients with shoulder pain after stroke (96575, 105771).\nNeck pain. In patients with chronic neck pain, receiving 6 sessions of bee venom acupuncture over a 3-week period reduces the impact of the neck pain and improves quality of life more than taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug loxoprofen 180 mg orally daily for 3 weeks. Pain intensity and neck disability index decreased similarly with both treatments when compared to baseline (111471).\nNotalgia paresthetica. Preliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with notalgia paresthetica shows that applying a product containing bee venom 0.04% and capsaicin 0.025% to the affected skin daily for 2 weeks reduces pruritus when compared to baseline (102530). A lack of control group limits the validity of these findings. Also, it is unclear if the effects are due to bee venom, capsaicin, or the combination.\nOsteoarthritis. Preliminary clinical research on the use of injected bee venom for the treatment of osteoarthritis is mixed (6045). However, a high-quality clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that injecting bee venom 100 mcg intradermally at 15 acupuncture points on the knees and back weekly for 12 weeks reduces knee pain and increases physical function scores when compared with a histamine control injection (102531).\nParkinson disease. Data on the effect of bee venom in patients with Parkinson disease are conflicting. Preliminary clinical studies in a small number of patients with Parkinson disease, stable on medication for at least four weeks, shows that receiving injections of dilute bee venom into 10 acupuncture points twice weekly, with or without traditional acupuncture, for 8-12 weeks improves motor symptoms, walking speed, quality of life, and ability to perform activities of daily living when compared with baseline, placebo, and/or conventional anti-Parkinson medications alone (95900, 96571, 102532). However, it is unclear whether bee venom acupuncture provides long-term benefits. Also, other research shows no benefit of bee venom therapy. One clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease shows that receiving a specific bee venom 100 mcg (Alyostal) injection subcutaneously once monthly for 11 months does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo. The researchers speculate that the monthly dose may have been too low to have an effect (96572). Higher quality research is needed to determine the benefits of bee venom, if any, in these patients.\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of bee venom for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nTopical:\nNotalgia paresthetica: A product containing bee venom 0.04% and capsaicin 0.025%, applied to the affected skin daily for 2 weeks, has been used (102530).\nParenteral (subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly) :Bee sting allergy: For bee venom immunotherapy in people hypersensitive to bee stings, increased doses of venom are given subcutaneously at selected intervals, usually weekly (6078). There are many possible protocols for immunotherapy. Some start with 0.0001 or 0.001 mcg of venom extract (6077). This is continued until a maintenance dose is achieved, usually 100 micrograms per venom. Once the maintenance dose is achieved, therapy can continue for years. Patients have varying sensitivities to venom and tolerability to immunotherapy, so it is not possible to provide a general dosing schedule for all patients. Venom immunotherapy should only be done by physicians thoroughly familiar with the use of these products, including the treatment of anaphylactic and other adverse reactions. It is also advised to have injectable epinephrine and emergency facilities nearby in case an anaphylactic reaction occurs (2619, 6074, 6078). Alcohol and tincture of iodine rapidly destroy the activity of bee venom and should not be applied at the site of injection. In China, bee venom is also commonly administered by electrophoresis, ultrasonophoresis, and acupuncture.\n\nFrozen shoulder: Bee venom diluted 1:10,000 and injected intramuscularly into acupuncture points twice weekly for 8 weeks has been used (96573).\n\nOsteoarthritis: Intradermal injection of bee venom 100 mcg at 15 acupuncture points on the knees and back weekly for 12 weeks has been used (102531).\n\nParkinson disease: Injections of dilute bee venom into 10 acupuncture points, with or without traditional acupuncture, twice weekly for 8-12 weeks has been used.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of bee venom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBee venom contains several physiologically active components. Melittin, a biogenic amine, is thought to be responsible for some of the therapeutic effects, and the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a major antigen responsible for adverse effects (111470, 111472). Bee venom contains 30% to 60% melittin, 10% to 12% PLA2, and minor quantities of serotonin, hyaluronidase, histamine, catecholamines, and kinin (6041, 6045, 6046, 111474). Melitin is a potent hemolytic (6042, 6045) that causes mast cell degranulation and activates PLA2 (6045). Other constituents in bee venom include apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide (MCD peptide), procamine, secapin, tertiapin, and other small peptides including adolapin (6, 111470). Sweet bee venom is processed to remove compounds causing adverse effects, such as PLA2, and to purify the active ingredient melittin (111470).\nCardiovascular effects\nPLA2 is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipid bonds, destroying the major component of cell membranes and leading to cell death (6041, 6046). PLA2 causes smooth muscle contraction, blood pressure reduction, increased capillary permeability, and mast cell destruction. PLA2 also reduces blood coagulation, possibly by reducing the activity of coagulation factors II, V, and VIII (6046). Melittin might also be partially responsible for bee venom's anticoagulant effects (6046).\nImmunologic effects\nFor desensitization to bee stings, bee venom stimulates an allergenic response, decreases leukocyte sensitivity to the allergen, and increases the number of T-suppressor cells (2619). There were early suggestions that bee venom could be a useful treatment in patients with arthritis. This theory was largely due to purported anti-inflammatory effects, and the observation that many beekeepers don't develop arthritis (6). While some components in bee venom have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, studies have also shown that other components are pro-inflammatory. For example, activators of PLA2 such as melittin, are thought to cause an increase in the synthesis of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1) and to stimulate arachidonic acid release resulting in an immune or inflammatory response (6044, 6071).\n\nSome components in bee venom seem to cause neutrophil degranulation and superoxide production (6, 6044), but other actions of bee venom components seem to decrease superoxide production (6, 6041, 6045, 6072). The formation of superoxide anions can be destructive to tissues. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme which hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid. The adhesive properties of hyaluronic acid hold cells together, so once hydrolyzed, other venom components can penetrate into the cell. For this reason, hyaluronidase is termed a spreading factor (6041).\n\nMCD peptide is chemically similar to the neurotoxin apamin. It causes mast cell degranulation and release of histamine at extremely low concentrations. Histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries (6041). The constituent adolapin inhibits inflammation and the prostaglandin-synthase system (6). In animals, whole bee venom, melittin, and apamin have also been shown to cause increases in cortisol levels (6039, 6040). The mechanism of other peptides is not yet understood (6041).\nNeurologic effects\nApamin is a neurotoxin (6045). It blocks many inhibitory effects, including alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and neurotensin-induced relaxation, by blocking calcium-dependent potassium channels (6041).\nPain inducing effects\nBee venom has toxic effects on pain producing- and pain conducting systems. It sensitizes nociceptor cells, causing release of pain-inducing substances such as adenosine triphosphate, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, and bradykinin. The venom also contains mast cell degranulating peptide which induces histamine release from mast cells, and hyaluronidase which increases the rate of spread of the venom (111475)."

A thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted on the medicinal use of beef tallow, either orally or topically.\nCardiovascular\nBeef tallow is rich in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). Population research has found an increased risk for heart disease with increased dietary consumption of saturated fats (94643, 115219). Both the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines strongly recommend reducing intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of total daily energy (94643, 115219). Both clinical and observational research show that a reduced intake of saturated fatty acids, especially from animal fat, along with increased intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (115227). In small clinical studies, consuming beef tallow increased levels of total and LDL cholesterol, as well as the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with consuming unsaturated oils such as canola, corn, and olive (115210, 115215).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol found in beef tallow are absorbed along with other sources of dietary fat. After oral administration, absorption requires bile salts and the intestinal lymphatic system (11120, 115211, 115217, 115218). Research comparing the absorption of fatty acids from beef tallow, which are primarily saturated, to those from sunflower oil, which are primarily unsaturated, shows that chylomicrons preferentially absorb the fatty acids from sunflower oil (11120, 115211). This may have been due in part to the stearic acid content of beef tallow; research suggests that fatty acids from stearic acid-rich foods have reduced absorption (115211).\nDistribution\nDietary long-chain fatty acids and cholesterol enter the circulation via chylomicrons. Plasma enzymes remove the fatty acids from triglycerides within the chylomicrons to allow for use as energy and uptake into various cells of the body (11120). In humans, intake of beef tallow increases plasma levels of palmitic and stearic acids, which are saturated fatty acids (115215). In rats fed beef tallow, levels of the unsaturated fatty acid cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid increased modestly in the skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver when compared with rats fed vegetable oils (115235).\nMetabolism\nSome dietary fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation for use as energy. Others are metabolized by enzymes that increase their length and unsaturation (11120).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeef tallow consists primarily of triglycerides rich in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The main saturated fatty acids include palmitic, myristic, and stearic acids. The main monounsaturated fatty acids include oleic and palmitoleic acids. Levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids are very low (115216, 115225, 115228, 115234, 115235, 115236) and include minor amounts of trans-oleic acid, trans-linoleic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (115228, 115235). Other constituents in beef tallow include cholesterol, choline, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E. Other vitamins are lacking or found in negligible amounts (115228, 115230, 115236). Fatty acid composition depends on the method and extent of refinement, beef variety, and cattle diet (115228).\n\nAny health effects of beef tallow likely relate to changes in plasma and tissue levels of specific fatty acids. Beef tallow consumption increases plasma levels of the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and stearic acid, as well as the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid. When compared with consuming plant oils, levels of linoleic acid, an essential omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and oleic acid, an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, are reduced (115215).\nAnti-cancer effects\nBeef tallow is of interest for cancer prevention or treatment. Beef tallow contains stearic acid (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). In laboratory research, stearic acid has exhibited antitumor and antimetastatic effects; however, opposing findings exist (115219). The effect of dietary stearic acid on cancer outcomes has not been investigated in human research. Additionally, stearic acid is only one of a mixture of fatty acids found in beef tallow and the effect of beef tallow itself has not been investigated.\nAntioxidant effects\nSome proponents of dietary beef tallow suggest that it can reduce oxidative stress when compared with plant oils, which are rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in plant oils are more susceptible to oxidation when used for cooking; however, susceptibility to oxidation is dependent on various factors, including the number of double bonds and the presence of endogenous or added antioxidants in the oil. Research shows that properly stored plant oils, such as peanut, canola, and sunflower, can be used safely with high-heat cooking (115227, 115230).\n\nAlthough concerns have been raised regarding the inflammatory and oxidative effects of plant oils rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, research has found that higher levels of linoleic acid in the body are associated with reduced inflammation (115227). Also, in vitro research on blood from moderately hypercholesterolemic adults shows that the susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to oxidation does not differ with changes in dietary fat source, including corn oil, canola oil, and beef tallow (115215).\nBone health\nDietary beef tallow is of interest for bone health. Beef tallow is a source of vitamin D which is essential for bone development and maintenance (115236). However, the effect of beef tallow on bone health has not been investigated in human research.\nCardiovascular effects\nBeef tallow is occasionally purported to be beneficial for cardiovascular health. The reasons for this are not clear; however, beef tallow is rich in stearic acid and some evidence suggests that stearic acid is less atherogenic, thrombogenic, and hyperlipidemic than other saturated fatty acids (115219, 115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). However, most clinical research of animal fat consumption does not support this claim. Additionally, beef tallow is rich in not only stearic acid but multiple saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). Both the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines strongly recommend reduced intake of saturated fatty acids (94643, 115219) based on findings from both clinical and observational research that show improved health outcomes with reduced intake of saturated fatty acids, especially from animal fat, and increased intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid. The evidence related to monounsaturated fatty acids is less clear, although most observational research suggests that the intake of monounsaturated fatty acids from plant sources is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (115224, 115227, 115232, 115233).\nDental health effects\nDietary beef tallow is of interest for dental health. Beef tallow is a source of vitamin D, which is essential for tooth development and maintenance (115236). However, the effect of beef tallow on dental health has not been investigated in human research.\nDermatological effects\nTopical beef tallow is of interest for skin care and as a moisturizing ingredient due to its stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid content. Stearic acid appears to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin, reducing the permeability and rigidity of the stratum corneum (115219). Oleic acid is used as an additive in certain transdermal and topical drug formulations to enhance penetration through the skin. Additionally, linoleic and linolenic acids are used as emollients (115234). In vitro research suggests that beef tallow may have antioxidant activity, which is purported to be beneficial for skin aging (115234). However, clinical research related to the use of beef tallow for skin health or dermatological conditions is lacking (115226).\nDiabetes effects\nDietary beef tallow is of interest for improving insulin sensitivity despite the available research suggesting its potential to increase insulin resistance. Intake of stearic acid and other saturated fatty acids found in beef tallow might be toxic to pancreatic islet beta cells, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (115219, 115231). Observational research in humans has found that a higher intake of dietary saturated fatty acids and lower intake of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid, is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (115227). Although not all research agrees, some clinical research shows that substituting polyunsaturated fats for saturated fatty acids comprising 5% of energy intake reduces blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and other measures of glycemic health (115227).\nImmune effects\nDietary beef tallow is of interest for immune health. Beef tallow is a source of vitamin D, which is involved in some aspects of immune function (115236). However, the effect of beef tallow on immune health has not been investigated in human research.\nLipid effects\nDietary beef tallow is of interest for improving levels of cholesterol in the blood. Beef tallow is rich in stearic acid (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). Some human and animal research suggests that dietary stearic acid is less likely to affect blood lipid levels than other saturated and trans fatty acids (115219, 115220, 115221, 115222, 115223). However, most clinical research on animal fat consumption does not support this claim. Additionally, beef tallow is rich in not only stearic acid but multiple saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). In human research, consuming beef tallow increases plasma levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with consuming oils containing unsaturated fatty acids. such as canola, corn, and olive. There was no effect on triglyceride levels (115210, 115215). In animal research, replacing part of a high-fat diet with beef tallow did not reduce levels of LDL cholesterol (115229). Clinical and observational research support reducing the intake of saturated fatty acids, especially from animal fat, and increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid for reducing levels of LDL cholesterol (115227).\nWeight loss effects\nBeef tallow is of interest for increasing satiety and supporting weight loss. Beef tallow is rich in stearic acid (115228, 115234, 115235, 115236). In some laboratory research, stearic acid seems to enhance the use of fatty acids as energy and reduce visceral adipose tissue. However, other laboratory research suggests that dietary stearic acid increases weight gain, decreases metabolism, and may have a pro-inflammatory effect (115219). Small, low-quality clinical studies have not supported the hypothesis that beef tallow is beneficial for satiety or weight loss when compared with other dietary fats (115212, 115214)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Beer is a popular beverage produced by the fermentation of sugars derived from starch-based materials. Barley (malt), hops, water, and yeast are the major constituents of beer, which is available in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic forms (34020). Beer has traditionally been used as an appetite and digestive stimulant.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when alcoholic beer is used orally in moderation. Beer that contains alcohol seems to be safe when 24 oz or less is consumed daily (2060). Non-alcoholic beer has been consumed in larger quantities with apparent safety (97067).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when alcoholic beer is consumed in large amounts. More than 24 oz of alcohol-containing beer per day can cause significant adverse effects (2060, 6840). A 2025 Scientific Statement by the American Heart Association states that binge drinking or regular consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day, or 36 ounces of regular beer with 5% alcohol by volume, increases blood pressure and is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes (116671).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when alcoholic beer is used orally. Alcohol is a teratogen. Use during pregnancy, especially during the first two months after conception, is associated with significant risk of spontaneous abortion, fetal alcohol syndrome, and developmental and behavioral dysfunction in infants and children (8100); avoid using. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of non-alcoholic beer when used during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when alcoholic beer is used orally. Alcohol is secreted in breast milk. Chronic use can cause abnormal psychomotor development and disrupt the infant's sleep-wake pattern. Alcohol also seems to reduce milk production (11878); avoid using. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of non-alcoholic beer when used during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, non-alcoholic beer seems to be well tolerated. The side effects of alcoholic beer depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: For alcoholic beer, common side effects include abdominal pain, aggression, blackouts, central nervous system (CNS) depression, confusion, diarrhea, drowsiness, emotional lability, flushing, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, indigestion, lack of coordination and trouble walking, migraines, nausea, neuropathies, perceptual and sensational disturbances, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to amnesia, cardiac myopathy, cirrhosis, dementia, hepatotoxicity, malnutrition, myocardial infarction (MI), physical dependence, and somnolence. Other effects of chronic use are chronic cerebellar syndrome, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, Korsakoff's psychosis, pancreatitis, skeletal myopathies, various types of cancer, and Wernicke's encephalopathy.\n\nChronic ingestion of three or more alcoholic beverages daily is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, ischemic stroke, and hypertension. Consumption of any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (3 or more drinks daily) is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and can lead to atrial fibrillation, cardiac myopathy, hypertension, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) (2261, 6843, 6892, 8102, 9004, 33984, 34028, 34054, 34058, 34059)(116671). Consumption of any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (841, 2271). A 2025 Scientific Statement by the American Heart Association states that binge drinking or regular consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day, or 36 ounces of regular beer with 5% alcohol by volume, increases blood pressure and is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes (116671).\n\nA case report describes a 68-year-old male who had consumed 15 beers daily for several months and who developed severe hyponatremia with irreversible second-degree atrioventricular block requiring a permanent pacemaker (99639). In another case report, a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder consumed 24 24-ounce beers then developed hyponatremia secondary to beer potomania which led to status epilepticus and suspected Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (112249).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, alcoholic beer can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals. Some common side effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting (6843, 8972, 9004, 34013, 34031). Chronic alcohol use is also associated with pancreatitis (6843, 9004).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to cirrhosis and hepatotoxicity (6843, 9004).\nless\nImmunologic\nBeer made with barley can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals (317, 99640). A case report describes a 32-year-old male who developed anaphylaxis within minutes of ingesting beer, and who had positive skin tests to at least nine beer brands (99640). Another case report describes a 33-year-old female who developed allergic reactions ranging from mild symptoms to anaphylaxis after consumption of beer or wine. The allergy was attributed to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is used in the fermentation of both beverages (107819). There have been occasional reports of asthma, facial swelling, and pruritic rash triggered by beer consumption (6174, 34042).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, alcoholic beer can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals. Some common side effects include lack of coordination and trouble walking. Other effects of chronic use include skeletal myopathies (6843, 8972, 9004).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, alcoholic beer can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals. Some common side effects include blackouts, central nervous system (CNS) depression, drowsiness, lack of coordination and trouble walking, migraines, neuropathies, and perceptual and sensational disturbances. Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more alcoholic drinks daily) can lead to amnesia, dementia, physical dependence, and somnolence. Other effects of chronic use are chronic cerebellar syndrome , Korsakoff's psychosis, and Wernicke's encephalopathy (6843, 8972, 9004, 34055, 34068).\n\nHeavy alcohol consumption (fifteen or more drinks weekly) is also associated with a higher percentage of white matter changes and larger ventricular and sulcal size on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This suggests that heavy alcohol consumption decreases cerebral blood flow and may contribute to brain atrophy (8651). Consumption of any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (841, 2271).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is evidence that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with the mutation of the p53 gene in individuals with esophageal carcinoma (9005). There is also some evidence that heavy consumption of wine is associated with the highest risk of esophageal cancer when compared with heavy consumption of beer and spirits (8972, 9004). Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and liver cancer (6843, 8972, 9004, 31557, 33977, 34010, 34037, 34045, 34061, 34065)(34069, 34085). Some research suggests an association between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but other studies do not support this association (8038). Daily consumption of one or more alcoholic drinks in females might increase the risk of breast cancer by 2% to 15% and increase mortality from breast cancer by as much as 30% (6843, 8100, 8974, 9006, 96686). There is also evidence suggesting that females who consume alcohol daily have an increased risk of developing breast cancer when the daily intake of folate is 300 mcg or less (8974, 9006).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, alcoholic beer can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals. Some common side effects include aggression, confusion, and emotional lability (6843, 9004, 34040). Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to dementia, physical amnesia, and somnolence (6843, 8972, 9004).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, alcoholic beer can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount ingested and can vary among individuals. A common side effect includes respiratory depression (6843, 8972, 9004).\nless\nRenal\nMultiple cases of hyponatremia secondary to beer potomania have been reported (107815, 112261, 112262). In one case report, a middle-aged male with a history of diabetes and chronic heavy alcoholic beer ingestion (about 12 beers daily) presented with severe hyponatremia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The cause of the hyponatremia was later determined to be beer potomania based on the patient's history and the ability of the sodium level to respond to solute-rich isotonic fluid administration. Concomitant features of impaired antidiuretic hormone activity necessitated treatment with diuresis and demeclocycline to ultimately normalize total body water and sodium levels (107815). In another case report, a 53-year-old male patient with alcohol use disorder with daily intake of 12 beers and 1 pint of vodka daily presented with worsening jaw pain with poor oral intake due to a history of metastatic head and neck cancer, fatigue, and hyponatremia. The patient was given 2 liters of intravenous normal saline, which caused overcorrection of his sodium levels within 14 hours, leading to concerns of osmotic demyelination syndrome. The patient was treated with D5W and desmopressin to return sodium to target levels. Patient history and low urine electrolytes confirmed a diagnosis of hypo-osmolar hyponatremia from low solute intake due to beer potomania (112262). In a third case, a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder and other comorbidities presented with alcohol intoxication, altered mental status, low body weight, and hypertensive crisis. Her euvolemic hyponatremia, likely due to suspected beer potomania, was treated with increased oral intake of salt and protein and water restriction to 800 mL daily (112261).\nless\nOther\nOrally, chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to malnutrition and poor glycemic control (6843, 8972, 9004).\n\nThere is evidence that suggests that consumption of more than six beers weekly is associated with a larger waist-to-hip ratio than those consuming an equivalent amount of hard liquor or wine. However, an association between moderate alcohol intake (equivalent to approximately 3 beers weekly or less) and waist-to-hip ratio does not seem to exist (10164, 10165). It is also unclear whether waist-to-hip ratios associated with the intake of wine, beer, or other alcoholic beverages have any clinical significance (9007).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Consumption of up to one alcoholic drink daily seems to improve general cognitive function in older males.\nObservational research suggests that elderly males who have a history of consuming up to one alcoholic drink daily seem to maintain better general cognitive function during their late 70s and 80s when compared with non-drinkers (6824, 6829). However, consumption of more than four drinks daily during middle age seems to be associated with significantly poorer cognitive function later in life (6824).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of developing CHF in older adults and a reduction in all-cause mortality in those with ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.\nObservational research in adults 65 years or older suggests that consuming 1-4 alcoholic drinks daily is associated with a reduced risk of developing CHF (8104). Observational research in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction suggests that consumption of 1-14 alcoholic drinks weekly is associated with reduced all-cause mortality when compared with non-drinkers with ischemic LV dysfunction. This benefit does not seem to occur for those patients with non-ischemic LV dysfunction (6827).\nless\nDiabetes. Moderate consumption of alcohol, including beer, seems to reduce the risk of developing diabetes and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in those with existing diabetes.\nPeople who consume alcohol in moderate amounts seem to have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (6172, 6891). A meta-analysis of 13 population studies suggests that drinking about two 12-ounce servings of beer daily is associated with a 9% lower risk of developing diabetes when compared with never drinking beer (96699). Additionally, in patients with a history of gestational diabetes, consuming approximately 1-4.5 servings of regular or light beer weekly is associated with a 45% to 50% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with no consumption (105948).\n\nModerate alcoholic beer consumption may also benefit those with existing diabetes. Patients with diabetes who consume alcohol in moderate amounts seem to have a reduced risk of CHD when compared with non-drinkers with type 2 diabetes. The risk reduction is similar to that found in healthy people who consume light to moderate amounts of alcohol (8653, 8654). Additionally, a cross-sectional study in patients with type 2 diabetes suggests an inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and carotid intima media thickness (107816).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. Non-alcoholic beer consumption seems to reduce the incidence of exercise-induced respiratory infections in male athletes.\nA clinical study in healthy male runners shows that drinking 1-1.5 liters of non-alcoholic beer daily, starting 3 weeks before a marathon and continuing for 2 weeks after the marathon, reduces the incidence of exercise-induced upper respiratory infection by three-fold when compared with placebo (97067).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Moderate to high consumption of alcohol, including beer, seems to reduce the risk of Helicobacter pylori infection.\nObservational research suggests that moderate to high consumption of alcohol, more than 75 grams weekly, from beverages such as beer and wine, is associated with a reduced risk of infection (8034).\nless\nOsteopenia. Observational research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption may improve bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal patients.\nObservational research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption in postmenopausal patients is associated with increased BMD in the trochanter, femoral neck, mid-radius, and lumbar spine (6825, 6836, 8655). Alcohol intake of one-half to one drink daily seems to have the greatest effect on BMD when compared with non-drinkers and heavy drinkers of alcohol (8655).\nless\nOverall mortality. Light to moderate alcohol consumption seems to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality in middle-aged or older adults.\nObservational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in people who are middle-aged or older (2058, 6823, 6837, 6843).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. It is unclear if alcohol consumption is beneficial for anxiety.\nThe effect of alcohol on anxiety is complex and may be affected by the psychological state of the user. It sometimes reduces anxiety, sometimes increases it, and sometimes has no effect (2266).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial for atherosclerosis.\nA cross-sectional study in patients with type 2 diabetes suggests an inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and carotid intima media thickness (107816).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if alcoholic beer consumption is beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that participating in twice weekly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 10 weeks while regularly consuming lager beer (Alhambra Especial 5.4% alcohol) 330 mL, once at dinner by females and twice daily at lunch and dinner by males, does not alter improvements in handgrip strength, jumping power, or cardiorespiratory fitness when compared with drinking water, non-alcoholic beer, or vodka (105950). A very small clinical study in adults shows that drinking 350 mL of beer immediately after 30 minutes of aerobic exercise is similarly effective to drinking 350 mL of water in returning blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability to baseline levels during recovery from exercise (112257).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if alcoholic beer consumption is beneficial for preventing cancer or cancer-related mortality. The available evidence suggests variable effects depending on cancer type.\nAlthough wine consumption has been associated with some reductions in cancer mortality, alcoholic beer consumption does not seem to have this effect (2058). In fact, there is some evidence that beer consumption might slightly increase cancer-related mortality (6823, 6843). Overall, alcoholic beer seems to have variable effects depending on the cancer type. Observational research suggests that moderate consumption of beer is associated with a DECREASED risk of developing bladder cancer and renal cell cancer (97952, 97060, 97064). However, beer is not associated with changes in the risk of brain cancer (96695), endometrial cancer (97065), skin cancer (97055, 97953), or multiple myeloma (97951). Furthermore, beer consumption has been associated with an INCREASED risk of breast cancer (6843) and gastric cancer (96694). Research regarding the association between drinking beer and colorectal cancer is inconsistent (96691, 97068). Results of a meta-analysis suggest that moderate to heavy consumption of alcohol, including beer, in males is associated with an 11% reduction in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (99638).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most observational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages is associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and a reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death. However, clinical research is limited. Also, binge drinking or regular consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes.\nPopulation research suggests that the consumption of alcoholic drinks, including beer, by otherwise healthy adults is associated with a reduced risk of developing CVD. Moderate alcohol use (1-2 drinks daily) is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction (MI) of approximately 30% to 50% when compared with nondrinkers (2267, 2268, 2271, 6888, 6892, 8648, 8649, 10128, 11879, 96690). Other observational research suggests that drinking one or fewer cans of beer weekly over 10 years is associated with a 57% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Light to moderate alcohol consumption also seems to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (2271, 2279, 6834, 6842, 6893). However, a large meta-analysis suggests that individuals who report light to moderate consumption of alcohol have overall healthier lifestyles than those who abstain from alcohol and that adjusting for these lifestyle factors attenuates any of the cardioprotective epidemiological effects that have been associated with light to moderate alcohol intake (107884).\n\nSome population research also suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality in otherwise healthy adults (2058, 2270, 6835, 6837). Light to moderate alcohol consumption in the year prior to first acute MI is associated with a reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk when compared with non-drinkers (8650).\n\nAlcohol consumption has also been evaluated in patients with existing CVD, with some mixed findings. A meta-analysis of cohort data as well as published observational and randomized controlled studies in patients with existing CVD has found that consumption of 6-8 grams of alcohol daily is associated with a 21%, 27%, and 50% reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events, respectively, when compared with non-drinkers (107817).\n\nHowever, contrasting evidence exists from population research. Consuming more than 2 alcoholic drinks daily is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality (841, 2060, 2261, 6173, 6890, 8648, 11879). Also, other population research suggests that drinking more than 1 can of beer weekly is not associated with lower cardiovascular risk when compared with abstaining from alcohol (102886), and there is evidence that consuming any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (841, 2271, 6842). In males with established CHD, consumption of 1-14 alcoholic drinks weekly, including beer, does not seem to have any effect on CVD or all-cause mortality when compared with males who drink less than 1 drink weekly (6173). Further, in males with a history of MI, consuming 3 or more drinks daily is associated with increased mortality (6173). Other preliminary clinical research in males with established CHD also suggests that drinking a specific type of beer (Maccabee beer) 330 mL daily for 30 days does not reduce blood pressure or improve plasma lipid levels when compared with those who abstain from alcohol use for the same duration (6839, 33996, 34077).\n\nThese findings have been summarized in a 2025 Scientific Statement by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA states that binge drinking or regular consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day, or 36 ounces of regular beer with 5% alcohol by volume, increases blood pressure and is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes (116671). Also, it concludes that the available evidence shows that consuming 1-2 alcoholic drinks per day does not increase the risk for coronary artery disease, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, or stroke, but only possibly supports a risk reduction (116671).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if non-alcoholic beer consumption improves symptoms in patients with cirrhosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with cirrhosis shows that adding 300 mL of non-alcoholic beer (O'Doul's) daily to a balanced diet and exercise program for 8 weeks seems to improve nutritional status, endothelial function, and quality of life when compared with baseline (105949). It is unclear if the benefit is due to non-alcoholic beer, lifestyle modifications, or the combination. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the control group.\nless\nGallbladder disease. Although there has been interest in using alcohol, including beer, for gallbladder disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alcohol for this purpose.\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there has been interest in using alcoholic beer for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alcohol for this purpose.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if moderate alcoholic beer or non-alcoholic beer consumption is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nA small nonrandomized clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that drinking a moderate amount of alcoholic beer (330 mL) or non-alcoholic beer (660 mL) daily for 6 months improves the frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms as measured by reductions of 4 or 3, respectively, in total Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores when compared with control (107814).\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if non-alcoholic beer consumption is beneficial for improving mood in healthy adults.\nA clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming 350 mL of non-alcoholic beer daily for 3 weeks improves mood scores on the Profile of Mood States 2 (POMS2) and Two-dimensional Mood Scale (TDMS) when compared with baseline (107813). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nShift work disorder. It is unclear if non-alcoholic beer consumption is beneficial in healthy adults working rotating or night shifts.\nA small open-label clinical study in healthy female nurses working rotating or night shifts shows that drinking 333 mL of non-alcoholic beer (San Miguel 0% alcohol) at dinner for 2 weeks diminishes sleep latency by about 8 minutes, decreases total activity during the night, and decreases anxiety when compared with baseline. However, it does not appear to increase duration of sleep (55403). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if beer consumption is beneficial in preventing SLE in females.\nObservational research suggests that modest daily alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing SLE in females. However, when the data were stratified by alcohol type, beer consumption specifically was NOT associated with a reduced risk of developing SLE (96684).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate beer for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: Alcohol intake is often measured in number of \"drinks.\" One drink is equivalent to a 4 oz or a 120 mL glass of wine, 12 oz of beer, or 1 oz of spirits.\n\nMost of the beneficial effects of alcohol have been demonstrated with light to moderate consumption, though definitions on what constitutes such consumption vary.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the standardization of beer.",

Patients of reproductive potential should avoid alcohol completely while taking acitretin and at least 2 months after discontinuation (108003).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nC (Consensus)\nConcomitant use may interfere with blood glucose control.\nAlcohol can impair gluconeogenesis and may increase the risk of acute hypoglycemia when used concomitantly with antidiabetes drugs (2262).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient available information about the pharmacokinetics of beer.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeer is a beverage produced through a fermentation process using a starch such as malted barley. Beer is available in alcoholic and non-alcoholic varieties. Typical American alcoholic beers average 4% to 5% ethanol by volume, although some beers contain much higher ethanol content (17). Beer contains minerals such as magnesium, potassium, selenium, and B vitamins. Beer can also contain flavonoids, especially darker beers (6892). Beer also contains, in very small amounts, flavonoids from the hops used to produce beer. These include xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and others (14385).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in beer for prostate cancer. Xanthohumol, a constituent of the hops used to produce beer, seems to induce apoptosis in benign prostate hyperplasia and malignant prostate cancer cells in vitro. It seems to activate proapoptotic proteins Bax and p53. Xanthohumol also seems to decrease activation of NF-kappaB (14386).\n\nSome types of beer seem to inhibit aromatase, possibly due to the xanthohumol constituent from hops; however, stout beer appears to inhibit aromatase more than lager beer even though stout beer contains a lower concentration of xanthohumol compared to lager (14385).\n\nPreliminary studies suggest that substances in beer may have inhibitory effects on heterocyclic amines, which are carcinogenic substances formed during cooking of some foods (6833).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe polyphenolic compounds in dark beer may contribute to the protective effect of beer against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (34086). After 30 days of moderate beer drinking, males with coronary heart disease had an increase in plasma antioxidants (total tocopherols and alpha-tocopherol) (6839).\nAntiplatelet/Anticoagulant effects\nAlcohol seems to reduce blood clotting potential and enhance blood clot breakdown (2261). Alcohol consumption decreases platelet aggregation, possibly via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (6892). Moderate alcohol consumption is also associated with an increase in plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, an indicator of fibrinolytic capacity (6894).\nBone effects\nModerate alcohol consumption might be protective against postmenopausal bone loss due to an increase in estrogen levels, increased calcitonin secretion, and reduced parathyroid hormone secretion (6825, 6836, 8655). However, heavy and chronic alcohol consumption reduces bone mineral density, possibly due to increased calcium and magnesium excretion, increased cortisol secretion, and reduced osteoblast activity (6836, 8656). Chronic alcohol users also often have other risk factors for osteoporosis, including poor nutrition, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and lower body weight (6825, 6836).\nCardiovascular effects\nBeer contains minerals such as magnesium, potassium, selenium, and B vitamins. Beer can also contain flavonoids, especially darker beers (6892). These polyphenolic compounds, which are found in higher concentrations in red wine, have antioxidant properties and may contribute to protection against heart disease by reducing oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2268). One study in postmenopausal females suggests that consuming non-alcoholic beer 660 mL daily for 2 years modestly reduces levels of LDL cholesterol (116669). However, in healthy, young, non-smoking males, drinking this volume of non-alcoholic beer does not reduce levels of LDL cholesterol (116670).\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for the protective effects of beer and other alcoholic beverages against coronary heart disease. One to two alcoholic drinks per day increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 12% (6892) and apolipoprotein A-I by about 2.2% (8649). One study suggests that consuming alcoholic beer 330 mL daily for 2 years modestly increases levels of HDL cholesterol (116669)The increase in HDL cholesterol levels might account for approximately 50% of the cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption (2261, 6838, 6841). Moderate alcohol consumption also decreases LDL cholesterol by 5% to 17%, triglycerides by 5% to 10%, and apolipoprotein B levels by 3.7% (6841, 8649). However, not all research agrees. A meta-analysis of heterogeneous clinical studies in mostly healthy adults suggests that drinking beer increases levels of total cholesterol by an average of 3.5 mg/dL and increases HDL cholesterol by an average of 3.6 mg/dL when compared with non-alcoholic beer or water. There were no differences between groups in levels of LDL cholesterol or triglycerides (105952).\n\nWhile some observational research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption might increase systolic blood pressure (6841), other observational research suggests that light to moderate alcohol consumption may actually decrease the risk (8102). However, one meta-analysis of heterogeneous clinical studies in mostly healthy adults suggests that drinking beer is not associated with changes in blood pressure when compared with drinking non-alcoholic beer or water (105952). Light to moderate alcohol consumption also seems to reduce coronary narrowing due to atherosclerosis (2261, 6840, 8652). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in healthy adults suggests that drinking alcoholic beer slightly increases flow mediated dilation (FMD) by 0.65% when compared with non-alcoholic beer or water (105952). Furthermore, some clinical research suggests that it is the alcohol content in beer that reduces arterial stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Consuming 50-200 mL of alcoholic beer seems to temporarily reduce arterial stiffness for about 30-60 minutes, whereas consuming 50-200 mL of non-alcoholic beer has no effect (105951).\n\nHigh levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine breakdown and removal requires folate and vitamin B6. Alcohol is an antagonist of folate metabolism (8101). However, there is evidence that an increased intake of dietary folate or the use of supplemental folate, 400 mcg/day, in moderate alcohol drinkers, can lower homocysteine levels compared to nonusers of alcohol (8101). However, beer also contains folate and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and its presence may explain why the increase in plasma homocysteine levels seen with other alcoholic beverages is not seen with beer (6832).\n\nThe protective effect of alcohol against cardiovascular disease is lost at higher intakes of alcohol (greater than 1-2 drinks per day). High alcohol consumption can cause increased homocysteine levels, hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke, fatal arrhythmias, and direct damage to heart muscle (alcoholic cardiomyopathy) (2060, 2261, 2267, 2270, 8101, 8102, 8103). Certain alcoholic beverages, in particular red wine, may be more protective than other alcoholic beverages such as beer. However, a difference in lifestyle among wine, beer, and other alcohol beverage drinkers, including diet and social class, might also explain why some alcoholic beverages appear to offer more protection than others against coronary heart disease (10129).\n\nPossible mechanisms by which alcohol could have a protective effect against ischemic stroke include increasing HDL and prostacyclin, decreasing fibrinogen, and inhibiting platelet aggregation (6842). There is evidence that suggests that moderate intake of alcohol increases cerebral blood flow (8651). Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of white matter changes and brain infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging in adults 65 years of age or older compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers (8651).\nCognitive effects\nAn observational study in Chinese adults 65 years or older with baseline cognitive function ranging from healthy to severe dementia suggests that alcohol consumption is associated with negative and long-term effects on cognitive function, even after adjusting for numerous covariates (107818).\nEndocrine effects\nModerate alcohol intake may be protective against the development of type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity (6891). However, other research suggests that alcoholic beer, as opposed to non-alcoholic beer, may worsen glycemic control in people with diabetes. Drinking alcoholic beer may worsen insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner but was not found to cause the acute deterioration of glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects (34063). In human research, drinking alcoholic beer was also associated with decreased fasting insulin concentrations (33988). Other human research shows that drinking non-alcoholic beer reduces fasting blood glucose and increases functional beta cells, while drinking alcoholic beer seems to increase fasting blood glucose and decrease functional beta cells (102885).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in how beer consumption affects the gut microbiome; some research suggests that the presence or absence of alcohol in beer may alter its effects. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking non-alcoholic beer, which contains biologically active polyphenols and phenolic acids, increases the diversity of different bacteria in the gut microbiome, while the alcohol in alcoholic beer seems to mitigate these effects (102885). However, research in healthy, young males shows that drinking non-alcoholic pilsner beer decreases diversity, decreasing Firmicutes and increasing Actinobacteria in the microbiome (116679). Other research in humans suggests that moderate consumption of alcoholic beer might have beneficial effects on the microbiome. One small observational study in healthy adults suggests that daily consumption of alcohol comprised of at least 70% as beer daily is associated with reduced levels of Clostridiaceae and higher levels of Blautia and Pseudobutyrivibrio species when compared with those that consume no beer and less than 1.5 grams of alcohol daily from other sources. There was no difference between groups in levels of other microbial species (105947).\nHormonal effects\nDrinking moderate amounts of beer decreases plasma testosterone levels in males, but not in females (34007).\nNeurological effects\nThe alcohol in beer is a central nervous system depressant (2263)."

However, the mixture does not appear to reduce recovery time compared to benzocaine in patients with moderate chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Additionally, applying honey alone 0.5 grams/kg (maximum 15 grams), appears to be more efficacious for both moderate and severe mucositis than either the honey mixture or benzocaine gel (55245).\nRadiation dermatitis. A small clinical study in patients undergoing radiotherapy shows that applying a topical ointment containing beeswax, olive oil, calendula oil extract, and St. John's wort oil extract to the treated area nightly during radiotherapy and for two weeks post-radiotherapy, while also applying a topical cream containing aloe vera gel, calendula oil extract, and St. John's wort oil extract to the treated area three to four times daily, reduces the intensity of dermatitis and improves quality of life scores when compared to baseline (105769). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if these findings are due to beeswax, other ingredients, or the combination.\nTinea corporis. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical use of a mixture of honey, olive oil, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks achieves clinical response in 75% of patients with tinea corporis (34092). It is unclear if this effect is due to beeswax, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nTinea cruris. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical use of a mixture of honey, olive oil, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks achieves clinical response in 78% of patients with tinea cruris (34092). It is unclear if this effect is due to beeswax, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nTinea versicolor. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical use of a mixture of honey, olive oil, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks achieves clinical response in 86% of patients with tinea versicolor (34092). It is unclear if this effect is due to beeswax, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nMore evidence is needed to rate beeswax for these uses.",

The mixture was made by grinding 10 grams of propolis and combining it with olive oil. Three months later the extract was filtered to remove granules of propolis and leave the olive oil-propolis extract. Then, 100 mL was mixed with beeswax 50 mL and honey 200 mL. The mixture was then heated to obtain a homogenous mixture. The beeswax utilized was from El Mahala, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt (55245).\n\nA topical product containing beeswax and herbal cream oil (Medilixir, Medilixir Pty Ltd) containing coconut oil, palm oil, castor oil, olive fruit oil, beeswax, hemp seed oil, wheat germ oil, and canola seed oil, has been used in one clinical study for decreasing post-burn itch (96329).\n\nIn one study, 1080 mL of a mixture of beeswax, olive oil, and alkanna was created and applied to wound dressings. Medical olive oil 1000 mL was heated until boiling, at which point beeswax 30 grams was added and melted. Once the beeswax melted, alkanna 50 grams was then added. The mixture was heated for another 5 minutes and passed through a filter. The mixture was then added to a dressing, which was applied once daily to second-degree burns (96328).",

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, beet seems to be well tolerated when used for medicinal purposes, short term.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Red stools and red urine.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hypocalcemia and kidney damage when ingested in large amounts.\nEndocrine\nTheoretically, ingestion of large quantities of beets could lead to hypocalcemia because of the oxaluric acid content (18).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, beet juice may cause red stools (94470, 97726, 100142, 100145, 105762, 115442). This red coloring of the stools is not harmful. Additionally, beet supplementation has been reported to cause black stools. In one case, a 79-year-old male on apixaban and clopidogrel presented with black stools, nausea, and vomiting after taking beet pills 2-3 days prior. The likelihood of upper gastrointestinal bleed was determined to be low based on factors such as normal vital signs and lack of severe anemia. The patient was diagnosed with beet-induced pseudo-hematochezia which was successfully treated with fluids and discontinuation of the beet supplement (113426).\n\nOther less common gastrointestinal side effects include loose stools, constipation, and nausea (100149).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, beet is known to produce red or pink urine (beeturia) in some people (32569, 34134, 94464, 94470, 97725, 97726, 100142, 100145, 100152, 105762),(113422, 115442).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral beet may improve athletic performance associated with aerobic activities. However, it is not clear who is most likely to benefit, for which type of competition it is most useful, or what dose or duration of use is most appropriate.\nSeveral small clinical trials, most of which enrolled elite athletes, recreational athletes, and sedentary males, as well as meta-analyses of some of these and other studies, show that beet improves various measures of athletic performance, including ability, muscular endurance, power output, sprinting, and strength (93844, 94464, 94468, 94469, 100143, 100150, 100152, 105761, 113422, 115441). Clinical research also shows that drinking beetroot juice improves the use of oxygen during exercise testing in recreationally-trained athletes, especially with severe exercise testing (94460, 94463, 94467, 100147, 105762, 115441). A small crossover study in recreationally active female adults shows that drinking beetroot juice 70 mL or 140 mL 2.5 hours before exercise reduces heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion during high-intensity cycling intervals when compared with placebo (115440). Also, in obese adolescents, taking beetroot juice daily for 6 days increases the time to exhaustion from severe exercise, but does not improve moderate exercise performance (100145).\n\nNot all research shows that beet supplementation benefits athletic performance. Another meta-analysis of several small clinical studies, including some of the studies above, shows that taking beetroot does not improve performance in high-intensity or sprint interval training (111159). Additionally, the majority of research in elite athletes does not support the use of beetroot juice to decrease the time needed to complete a task, including sprint time trials, aid in some sort of graded exercise test, or improve the use of oxygen during exercise testing (94455, 94458, 94460, 94461, 94464, 94465, 94466, 94469, 94473, 100142)(100153, 105763, 115438). The supposed lack of effect of beetroot juice in elite athletes might be related to the natural production of nitrates and nitrites in the body or the increased ability to use oxygen that comes from extensive training (94458, 94463). Alternatively, any changes might be very small (<1%) and not identified with statistical comparisons, although even very small changes might be beneficial in competition (94464).\n\nThe most commonly used doses in all studies, regardless of effect, have included an acute dose of beetroot juice 70-500 mL up to 3 hours prior to exercise (93844, 94463, 94464, 94466, 94467, 94473, 97726, 100142, 100143, 105761)(105762, 111159, 113422, 115441) or chronic dosing of up to 500 mL daily for 3-6 days (94459, 94464, 94469, 100145, 100147, 100153, 111159, 113422). Less commonly, beetroot juice 70-140 mL daily, betalain-rich concentrate 100 mg daily, or a beetroot-based nutritional gel 100 grams daily, have been taken for longer dosing schedules of 7-15 days (97720, 100144, 100148, 100152, 105763, 113422). Benefits in elite athletes, most often related to time trials, are usually limited to studies using chronic dosing of 7-15 days, which is longer than the duration of 6 days used in the majority of studies (94473, 97720, 100144, 100148). Brands of juice used in clinical trials have included Beet It Sport (James White Drinks Ltd.) (94455, 94458, 94465, 100142, 100143, 100144, 100148, 105761, 105763, 115440), Beet It Stamina Shot (James White Drinks Ltd.) (93844), Beet It (James White Drinks Ltd) (94457, 94459, 94460, 94467, 94469, 97726, 100145, 100153, 105762, 111159), Beet It Pro Elite Shot (James White Drinks Ltd.) (115438, 115441), and Love Beets Beetroot Juice (Gs Fresh Ltd.) (94461, 94462). Although plasma levels have not been analyzed in all studies, the majority of studies suggest that these doses are adequate to increase levels of nitrates or nitrites, which is thought to be essential for increasing athletic potential (93844, 94455, 94458, 94459, 94460, 94465, 94467, 94469, 94466, 94473, 97726). The evidence also suggests benefit in both normoxic and hypoxic environments (94465, 100148, 105763).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Drinking beetroot juice 7-8 times over 48 hours after strenuous exercise may reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness, but evidence is conflicting.\nSome clinical research shows drinking beetroot juice (Love Beets Beetroot Juice, Gs Fresh Ltd.) 125 mL or 250 mL seven times over 48 hours after strenuous box jumps improves muscle soreness when compared with placebo and sodium nitrite (96964, 97722). Other small clinical studies show that drinking beetroot juice 50-250 mL as eight separate doses over 48 hours after strenuous exerciseimproves muscle soreness and reduces tissue edema when compared with placebo (94461, 113424).\n\nHowever, drinking beetroot juice 250 mL as seven separate doses over 48 hours after running a marathon does not appear to reduce muscle soreness when compared with placebo (94462). A meta-analysis of 4 small studies, mostly in healthy or physically active males, shows that drinking beetroot juice improves the pressure pain threshold, which is a measure of muscle soreness, at 48- and 72-hours post-exercise when compared with a fruit-flavored drink. However, beetroot juice does not improve subjective muscle soreness scores (111160). The validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the beetroot juice regimens among the included studies. Further, these results should not be generalized to elite athletes.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Drinking beetroot juice for up to 14 days may not improve exercise capacity in patients with COPD.\nA meta-analysis of eight small clinical trials in patients with COPD shows that taking nitrate-rich beetroot juice does not improve most measures of exercise capacity, including the 6-minute walk test, cycling ergometry endurance time, and maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO2 max), when compared with placebo. Additionally, beetroot juice did not reduce blood pressure or heart rate. However, the analysis did show a significant improvement in scores on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exhaustion scale with beetroot juice over placebo. Nitrate-rich beetroot juice doses ranged from 70-140 mL daily for up to 14 days (104200).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCognitive function. It is unclear if drinking beetroot juice is beneficial for cognitive function.\nA small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity on a calorie-restricted diet shows that drinking 70 mL of concentrated beetroot juice daily for 14 days improves the time to complete part B of the trail making test, which is a test of cognitive function, but not part A, when compared with controls (111158). However, the duration and size of this study limits its validity. Further, it is unclear whether any improvement is clinically significant.\n\nThe effect of acute beet administration on cognitive function has also been studied. A very small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking beet extract (RedNite, Enovate Biolife) chewable tablets 3 grams 90 minutes prior to neuropsychological testing improves immediate and delayed memory capacity, frontal lobe function, and lexical flexibility but does not improve working memory, information processing speed, or subjective reports of memory performance when compared with placebo (113427).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral beetroot extract is beneficial in patients with CHD.\nA small clinical trial in patients with CHD shows that taking red beetroot extract 500 mg, containing around 25 mg betalains, twice daily for 2 weeks reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15 mg/dL and reduces triglycerides by 8 mg/dL when compared to baseline. Slight improvements in blood pressure and blood glucose were also reported, but these changes were not clinically significant (103883). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear whether beetroot can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CHD.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral beetroot is beneficial in patients with long COVID-19.\nA small clinical study in adults with long COVID-19 shows that taking beetroot juice 200 mL. providing 600 mg nitrate, daily for 14 days does not improve fatigue resistance, hand grip strength, or overall functional exercise capacity when compared with a placebo providing 60 mg nitrate (116094). However, the study may have been inadequately powered or of too short a duration to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral beetroot is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in healthy individuals or patients with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, or overweight or obesity shows that consuming beetroot juice or beet leaves does not improve levels of triglycerides or total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with controls (111163). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the enrolled patients and beetroot regimens.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral beetroot juice improves recovery from muscle damage after exercise.\nA meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in healthy or physically active individuals, most of which enrolled males only, shows that drinking beetroot juice improves measures of muscle recovery at 72 hours post-exercise when compared with a fruit-flavored drink. However, beetroot juice does not consistently improve recovery at earlier time points post-exercise, nor does it reduce levels of creatine kinase or markers of inflammation (i.e., interleukin-6, interleukin-8, c-reactive protein, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha) (111160). However, the validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the beetroot juice regimens among the included studies, which usually varied from 210-250 mg of nitrate in 7-11 servings over 3-7 days. Further, these results should not be generalized to elite athletes. Another very small clinical study in semi-professional female athletes shows that ingesting beetroot juice 50 mL 8 times over 48 hours after exercise-induced muscle damage enhances the recovery of some functional parameters such as muscle endurance but not others such as flexibility and vertical jump performance when compared with placebo (113424).\nless\nHypertension. Chronic daily oral beetroot juice may slightly reduce systolic blood pressure in healthy individuals and in adults with hypertension. However, a clinically relevant reduction in diastolic blood pressure is not observed. The effect of acute oral beet intake on blood pressure is unclear.\nMeta-analyses of small, mostly low-quality clinical studies show that taking beetroot juice modestly reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in healthy adults and adults with hypertension (94470, 97718, 97728, 116095). The average reduction in SBP and DBP with beetroot juice consumption is about 4-5 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, which is greater than the effect seen with blackcurrant juice, nitrate-depleted beetroot juice, water, or no intervention. In mixed populations, the most benefit is seen when beetroot juice is taken for at least 2 weeks or at doses of 500 mL daily (97728, 116095).\n\nThe effect of acute beet supplementation on blood pressure is conflicting. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking beet juice (Beet It, James White Company) 140 mL two hours prior to cardiovascular measurements reduces resting SBP by about 4 mmHg but does not improve resting or post-exercise DBP, central blood pressure, or arterial stiffness nor does it improve post-exercise SBP when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis suggests that the reductions in resting SBP were only observed in males, not females (113423). Another small clinical study shows that consuming beet 100 grams baked into bread modestly decreases DBP over a 6-hour period when compared with white bread (97725). It is possible that genetics might play a role in the magnitude of effect seen with beetroot consumption. Adults with a specific gene polymorphism, eNOS Glu298Asp, experienced a greater reduction in DBP after consuming beet-containing bread (97724).\n\nBeet has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, clinical research shows that taking a combination of beetroot powder (Sensient) 300 mg, olive leaf extract 1000 mg, and green coffee bean extract 200 mg daily for 6 weeks does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo (97723).\n\nSome research suggests that identifying effects on blood pressure might be dependent on the method of measurement, including clinic resting measurements, 24-hour monitoring, or morning/evening home resting measurements (97729).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral beet is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nA small clinical study in overweight or obese individuals with dyslipidemia shows that taking freeze-dried beet leaf 2.8 grams daily for 4 weeks in addition to nutritional guidance does not lower triglyceride levels when compared with nutritional guidance alone (100146).\n\nBeet has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical trial in patients at risk for heart disease shows that a specific combination of beet and hawthorn berry (Neo40-Daily, Neogenis Labs), taken twice daily for 30 days, can modestly reduce blood triglyceride levels when compared to baseline (18222). It is unclear if these findings are due to beet, hawthorn berry, or the combination.\nless\nLiver disease. Although there has been interest in using oral beet for liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beet for this purpose.\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral beetroot juice is beneficial for muscle strength.\nA meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies in healthy males shows that taking beetroot juice or beetroot gel 2-3 hours before exercise improves muscular strength when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis suggests that beetroot-based supplements improve muscular strength in a fatigued but not resting state (113422). A small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity on a calorie-restricted diet shows that drinking 70 mL of concentrated beetroot juice daily for 14 days improves handgrip strength by approximately 18% compared with 4% in controls (111158). However, it is unclear whether any improvement is clinically significant.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral beet leaf or beetroot juice is beneficial for weight loss.\nA small clinical study in patients with overweight or obesity and dyslipidemia shows that taking freeze-dried beet leaf 2.8 grams daily for 4 weeks in addition to nutritional guidance does not reduce body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with nutritional guidance alone (100146). Similarly, a small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity on a calorie-restricted diet shows that drinking 70 mL of concentrated beetroot juice daily for 14 days does not improve weight loss when compared with controls (111158). However, the size and duration of this study may have been inadequate to detect differences between groups.\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral beetroot juice is beneficial in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nA small clinical trial in pregnant patients with hypertension who are at approximately 22-35 weeks gestation shows that taking beetroot juice (James White Drinks Ltd) 70 mL daily for 8 days does not reduce blood pressure when compared with a nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (100151). However, the study was small and designed to investigate the feasibility of using beetroot juice in this population.\nless\nPulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral beetroot juice is beneficial in patients with pulmonary hypertension.\nA small clinical study shows that taking beetroot juice (Beet-It Sport; James White Drinks Ltd) 70 mL twice daily for 7 days does not improve right ventricular systolic function when compared with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice in patients with pulmonary hypertension (100149). However, this study was small and not adequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. It is unclear if oral beetroot juice is beneficial in patients with Raynaud syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with Raynaud syndrome undergoing cold sensitivity tests shows that drinking beetroot juice (Beet-It, James White Drinks Ltd) 70 mL daily for 13 days, followed by 140 mL prior to testing, does not reduce pain in the hands or feet, but might improve thermal comfort in the feet, when compared to baseline (103884). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate beet for these uses.",

After administration of a single 70 mL dose of beetroot juice (James White Drinks Ltd) in healthy individuals, maximum plasma concentrations of nitrite and nitrate are approximately 0.4 mcmol/L and 316 mcmol/L, respectively (111157). Betanin has not been detected in plasma after ingestion of beetroot or beet (97719).\nMetabolism\nNitrate from beet is reduced to nitrite by bacteria in the gut, as well as by bacteria in the saliva after re-entering the mouth during enterosalivary circulation (94467). The nitrite is then reduced to nitric oxide in the stomach by reductase enzymes (94467). Nitric oxide can be measured in the breath (100149).\nExcretion\nNitrate and nitrite are excreted in the urine (94457, 97729). Betalains from beet are also excreted in the urine (34112).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of beet are the root and the leaf. Beet contains a wide variety of betalains, as betacyanins or betaxanthins, including betanin (18, 32569, 34134, 97719). Beet also contains nitrates, at least 250 mg per 100 grams (18222, 34119, 94468). The leaves are rich in flavonoids (100146).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBeet has been investigated for use to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage. The betalains in beet are thought to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 activity (94462). In patients with type 2 diabetes, a small clinical study shows that drinking concentrated beetroot juice 12 mL twice daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor kappa-B, but does not reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, or nitric oxide when compared with controls (111156).\nAntilipemic effects\nBeet contains fiber that can lower cholesterol (34139). Human research suggests that adding beet fiber to the diet increases cholesterol secretion and possibly lowers cholesterol levels (34133).\nCardiovascular effects\nBeet contains nitrates. In the body, nitrate metabolites can have vasodilatory effects, which might result in hypotensive effects (18222, 34119, 94468, 97725). Hypotensive effects of beet have been shown in human research. This is likely due to the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway (94457). Overall, most clinical research in various populations, including adults with hypertension, shows that consuming beetroot juice modestly reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure (116095). Although there is some evidence that drinking beetroot juice might improve endothelial function and decrease arterial stiffness, study results are mixed (94456, 111161, 111162). In human research, drinking beetroot juice had no effects on microvascular blood flow (94456, 115439) or flow mediated dilation (116094).\nErgogenic effects\nThe potential athletic performance ergogenic effects of beet are possibly due to the conversion of nitrate to nitric oxide in saliva (94462). Nitric oxide acts as a vasodilator (18222). Consuming beet has been shown to decrease the amount of oxygen needed during exercise in some research (94459, 94463, 94466, 94467, 100147). Laboratory research also suggests that nitrate might induce muscle fiber depolarization, resulting in muscle contraction (100143). Some research suggests that physiological adaptation of the muscle is needed over multiple days before athletic benefits are seen (100152). In some research, a single dose of beetroot juice prior to exercise does not impact blood glucose or lactate levels, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, oxygen consumption, skeletal muscle metabolism, or ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise (97721, 115438, 115440); however, a small crossover study of recreationally active females shows a modest reduction in RPE and heart rate (115440).\n\nBeet is also high in the compound betalain, which acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in laboratory research. This might reduce muscle cell damage (97720).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn a small clinical study of adults with long Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), consuming beetroot juice 200 mL, providing 600 mg nitrate, daily for 2 weeks increases the intestinal concentration of Bifidobacterium and other beneficial species, including Akkermansia, Oscillospira, Prevotella, Roseburia, and Ruminococcaceae. It also increases fecal levels of nicotinate and trimethylamine, and decreases fecal levels of butyrate, choline, malonate, methanol, and trigonelline when compared with placebo (116094)."

Benefit seems to be most notable with the 600 mg daily dose (98030, 98032, 105468). However, benfotiamine does not seem to improve peripheral nerve function as measured by nerve conduction and vibrational perception in patients with diabetic neuropathy when compared with control (98030, 98032, 98037).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBenfotiamine is absorbed via passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa (98047). Because benfotiamine is a fat-soluble prodrug of thiamine, it has a much higher bioavailability than thiamine, which is a water-soluble vitamin (98021, 98022, 98028, 98029, 98047). Benfotiamine also has superior absorption parameters compared with other fat-soluble thiamine analogs, such as fursultiamine and thiamine disulfide (98022, 98026). Food does not seem to significantly alter the absorption of benfotiamine (105467).\n\nIn one clinical study, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of thiamine after oral administration of benfotiamine 40 mg was 65% higher than was reported with thiamine 100 mg. Additionally, thiamine exposure, reported as the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), was 55% higher with benfotiamine. Differences in AUC and Cmax values were even more pronounced when looking at whole blood rather than plasma parameters (98021). In another clinical study, the plasma thiamine Cmax and AUC values were around 8-10-fold higher with benfotiamine compared with thiamine (98047). The time to maximum thiamine plasma concentration with benfotiamine ranges from 1-2.9 hours (98021, 98026, 98028, 98047, 105467).\nDistribution\nAs a fat-soluble prodrug, benfotiamine has a large volume of distribution. In one clinical study, a volume of distribution of 37,243 L was reported after oral intake of benfotiamine 250 mg (98028).\nMetabolism\nAfter absorption, benfotiamine is converted to thiamine via a reduction reaction. Thiamine is then metabolized to thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate, which reach peak concentrations in the blood 3.5-8 hours and 8-24 hours, respectively, after ingestion of benfotiamine (98047, 105467).\nExcretion\nMost clinical studies report the plasma half-life of thiamine after administration of benfotiamine to be around 1-2.5 hours (98028, 98047). The half-life of benfotiamine was found to be 0.5 hours in one study (98028).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBenfotiamine is a fat-soluble precursor of thiamine (vitamin B1). Its chemical structure allows it to pass through cell membranes, where it is ultimately converted to active thiamine. Research shows that taking benfotiamine can increase thiamine levels in the blood better than taking thiamine, which is water-soluble (98047). The clinical effects of benfotiamine are related in part to its ability to increase plasma thiamine levels. However, benfotiamine also has some unique pharmacologic effects of its own.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that benfotiamine inhibits the expression of certain cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, thus preventing the generation of inflammatory lipid mediators in the arachidonic acid pathway (98041).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that benfotiamine has antioxidant effects (98033, 98043). Benfotiamine has been shown to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species and minimize subsequent DNA damage in a rat model of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (98043). Benfotiamine's antioxidant capacity may help explain its beneficial effects in patients with diabetic neuropathy (98033).\nAntitumor effects\nIn vitro research shows that benfotiamine has antitumor effects (98033, 98043, 98049). Some in vitro research shows that benfotiamine limits oxidative DNA damage, suggesting that it may have a role in cancer prevention (98033, 98043). Another in vitro study shows that benfotiamine induces paraptosis, a type of programmed cell death different from apoptosis, in leukemia cells (98049).\nCognitive effects\nAbnormal glucose metabolism in the brain has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of Alzheimer disease. In vitro and animal research shows that benfotiamine can reduce the production and deposition of beta-amyloid plaques, possibly by decreasing the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3, an enzyme involved in regulating glucose metabolism (98036, 98040). Benfotiamine has also been shown to improve cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (98036). A case series of adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease found that taking benfotiamine 300 mg daily for 18 months modestly improved cognitive function on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) when compared to baseline (98050).\nGlycemic effects\nThe utility of benfotiamine in the prevention or management of micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes is related to clinical and laboratory evidence demonstrating its ability to block certain pathways and processes triggered by hyperglycemia (98031, 98034, 98044). For one, benfotiamine increases the activity of transketolase (11467). This enzyme plays a key role in glucose metabolism. Increased transketolase activity blocks or alters four pathways of hyperglycemia-induced vascular damage: the hexosamine pathway, the advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation pathway, the polyol pathway, and the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C pathway (98031, 98034, 98829). These pathways, along with hyperglycemia-associated activation of NF-kappaB and formation of reactive oxygen species, are thought to play a role in the development of neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes. Benfotiamine has been shown to interfere with each of these processes to some degree (98031, 98034, 98044, 98829). Benfotiamine has also been shown to limit hyperglycemia-induced vascular damage by normalizing replication rates and decreasing apoptosis of endothelial cells (98830, 98831). However, not all research supports the hypothesis that benfotiamine interferes with pathways of hyperglycemia-related vascular complications (98039)."

    "Berberine": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Berberine is a bitter-tasting, yellow-colored alkaloid that is found in the roots, rhizomes, and stem bark of various plants, including European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, greater celandine, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric (34203, 91951). It was first isolated in the early 20th century from plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (91956).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Berberine has been used safely in doses up to 1.5 grams daily for 6 months (262, 13520, 20579) (34317, 34228, 34247, 34253, 34262, 34263, 34265, 34267, 34277, 34282), (34283, 34286, 34287, 34289, 34293, 34301, 34305, 34306, 34319, 34325)(99920, 99921, 103194) or up to 1 gram daily for 24 months (99921, 103197). ...when used topically. Berberine ointment has been applied with apparent safety for up to 20 days (13526).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in newborns. Berberine can cause kernicterus, particularly in preterm neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (2589). It is unclear if berberine is safe in older children.\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Berberine is thought to cross the placenta and may cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine (2589). Also, berberine may stimulate uterine contractions (91951).\nLACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk (2589).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, berberine is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain and distension, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting.\n\nIntravenously: Facial flushing, painful swelling at the injection site.\n\nSerious Adverse Events (Rare):\n\nIntravenously: Ventricular tachycardia consistent with torsades de pointes.\nCardiovascular\nIn four of 12 patients with refractory congestive heart failure, intravenous infusion of berberine at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg per minute caused ventricular tachycardia consistent with torsades de pointes (33642).\nless\nDermatologic\nWhen administered intravenously, berberine can cause painful swelling at the injection site or facial flushing (34330). In three of 12 people injected subcutaneously with berberine, permanent hyperpigmentation at the injection site occurred (33698).\n\nOrally, berberine may cause rash, but this event appears to be rare (34285, 110106).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, berberine may cause hypoglycemia (111363).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, berberine may cause diarrhea, constipation, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, gastroesophageal reflux, and bitter taste (33648, 33689, 34245, 34247, 34285, 91953, 99920, 99921, 103194, 103197)(110106, 111363, 111699, 113462, 114769).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, berberine may occasionally cause an increase in transaminases (99921, 103194). However, meta-analyses have found no significant effect of berberine on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (104508, 111363).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nReports of mild muscle pain and muscle weakness have been reported following the use of a combination product containing berberine, policosanol, red yeast rice, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin (34283). It is unclear if these effects are due to berberine or other constituents.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, berberine may cause dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, and headache (33648, 99921, 113462).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCanker sores. Some evidence shows that berberine gel applied to canker sores may reduce pain and the size of the sores, but it has not been compared to conventional treatments.\nSome clinical research shows that applying a gel containing berberine 5 mg/gram four times daily for 5 days can reduce pain by 26% and ulcer size by 30% when compared with placebo in patients with minor recurrent canker sores. Erythema and exudation also appear to be improved (91955).\nless\nDiabetes. Berberine seems to moderately reduce blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes; it may provide additional benefit when given with conventional medications.\nSome clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg 2-3 times daily for 2-4 months can reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose (PPG) in subjects with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo, and may be similarly effective to metformin 500 mg 2-3 times daily or rosiglitazone 4 mg daily (20579, 34247, 34265, 110099). Large meta-analyses show that taking berberine, 0.9-3 grams in 2-3 divided doses daily for 1-11 months, in combination with lifestyle interventions, can reduce FPG by 10-16 mg/dL, PPG by 27-34 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.4% to 0.7% when compared with lifestyle interventions alone. Also, taking berberine in combination with oral hypoglycemic drugs appears to lower FPG by 12-19 mg/dL, PPG by 18-24 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.6% to 0.9% when compared with hypoglycemic drugs alone (91956, 110097).\n\nBerberine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 500 mg with Bifidobacterium adolescentis 100 million colony-forming units (CFU) twice daily for 16 weeks reduces FPG by 10 mg/dL, PPG by 28 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.22% when compared with placebo (110099). Another clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 600 mg twice daily with a multi-strain probiotic supplement, containing more than 50 billion CFU, once daily for 12 weeks reduces postprandial cholesterol by 15 mg/dL and postprandial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Postprandial triglyceride levels were also improved, while postprandial levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were not affected (110100).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral berberine, when taken with amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with or without clarithromycin, might be as effective as bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT), vonoprazan quadruple therapy, and PPI-based triple therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori.\nMost studies evaluate berberine in combination with an antibiotic and acid blocker for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Open-label clinical studies in patients with treatment-naïve H. pylori infection shows that taking berberine 300-500 mg with amoxicillin 1 gram and an acid reducer such as esomeprazole 20 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, or vonoprazan 20 mg, with or without clarithromycin 500 mg, 2-3 times daily for 14 days is non-inferior to BQT, vonoprazan quadruple therapy (vonoprazan, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth), and rabeprazole quadruple therapy (rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth) for H. pylori eradication and clinical symptom improvement. Eradication rates were around 70% to 91% and 69% to 90% in the berberine- and bismuth-containing groups, respectively. BQT is a guideline-recommended treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication (97234, 111697). Also, berberine triple therapy appears to be better tolerated when compared with BQT. Quadruple therapy consisted of amoxicillin, rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and bismuth tartrate (110107). A smaller clinical study in patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcers shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 6 weeks is more effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, but is less effective for promoting ulcer healing (34319).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Clinical research shows that taking berberine orally, alone or in combination with other ingredients, reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in people with hyperlipidemia.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in people with hyperlipidemia or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) show that berberine reduces total cholesterol by 13-32 mg/dL, triglycerides by up to 34 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 10-26 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B by 0.25 g/L when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. However, the meta-analyses conflict on the effect of berberine on HDL cholesterol, with the studies in patients with hyperlipidemia showing that it reduces HDL cholesterol by 2-3 mg/dL while the analysis in patients with NAFLD shows that berberine has no effect on HDL cholesterol when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. (20579, 34228, 111363, 111700, 113462).\n\nMeta-analyses also show that berberine alone is similarly effective to statins at lowering lipid levels (100983, 111362). Administration of berberine in combination with lipid-lowering drugs such as statins lowers total cholesterol by 10-15 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by up to 9 mg/dL, and triglycerides by up to 30 mg/dL when compared with lipid-lowering drugs alone (91953, 91956, 99921, 100983, 111362). The dosage of berberine used most often in these studies was 500 mg twice daily, or 200-500 mg three times daily for 3-24 months. However, one meta-analysis suggests that berberine's effects on lipid levels may be transient, with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol lacking in studies lasting 3 or more months (111362).\n\nBerberine has also been studied in combination with other supplements. Taking a combination product containing berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, and red yeast rice 200 mg daily for up to 12 months reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo or ezetimibe 10 mg (34262, 34283, 34301). Taking another combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine, red yeast rice, policosanol, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin daily for up to 12 months reduces total cholesterol by 10% to 13% and LDL cholesterol by 14% to 21%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 4% to 5% when compared with baseline or placebo. These effects are comparable to those seen with pravastatin 10 mg daily (89438, 92142). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. It is possible that the majority of the therapeutic effect is due to an ingredient in red yeast rice (monacolin K) that is identical to lovastatin.\nless\nHypertension. Berberine may have added benefits for reducing blood pressure when used in combination with amlodipine.\nA meta-analysis shows that taking berberine 0.9 grams daily in combination with amlodipine for 2 months reduces systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg when compared with amlodipine alone (91956).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Berberine may improve some metabolic characteristics in women with PCOS and insulin resistance. It may also increase live births, although the data are conflicting.\nClinical research in patients with PCOS and insulin resistance shows that taking berberine 500-550 mg 2-3 times daily for 3 to 6 months reduces fasting plasma glucose, markers of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, testosterone levels, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, acne severity, and markers of inflammation when compared with placebo or baseline. Berberine also seems to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels (34282, 91952, 111364). Lipid parameters also improved when compared with metformin, as did waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, and SHBG levels in some, but not all, studies (34282, 91952).\n\nThe effect of berberine on ovulation, pregnancy, and birth rates in women with PCOS is unclear. A meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies conducted in China in patients with PCOS shows that taking berberine 900 mg daily in combination with other treatments, such as clomiphene or letrozole, for 3 to 6 months improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates when compared to medication therapy alone (115725). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including treatment combinations and duration. Additionally, the effect on birth rates was not evaluated. A clinical study, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for three months prior to controlled ovarian stimulation increases the number of clinical pregnancies and live births by almost two-fold when compared with placebo. These effects are comparable to taking metformin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months (91952). However, other clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine 1.5 grams daily and letrozole for ovarian stimulation does not increase live birth rates when compared with letrozole alone (97235).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects.\nA small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia who developed metabolic syndrome associated with antipsychotic therapy shows that taking berberine 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 1.1 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.4 kg/m2, total cholesterol by 22 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 20 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.09% when compared with placebo (110103).\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might prevent atrial fibrillation shortly after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\nA small clinical study in Chinese patients who underwent CABG surgery shows that taking berberine 400 mg three times daily for 7 days reduces the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 50% when compared with placebo (110106).\nless\nBiliary disorders. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with biliary disorders.\nA small clinical study in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis shows that taking berberine ursodeoxycholate, an ionic salt formulation of berberine and ursodeoxycholic acid, 500-1000 mg twice daily for 6 weeks reduces levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker of cholestasis and bile duct injury, when compared with placebo. ALP levels decreased by at least 50% in 7% and 17% of patients taking 500 mg and 1000 mg, respectively, compared with 0% of patients taking placebo (110105).\nless\nBurns. Topical berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical treatment of second degree burns with an ointment containing berberine, beta-sitosterol, sesame oil, and other ingredients, applied every 4 hours for 20 days, is similar to conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream (13526). It is unclear if this benefit is due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if berberine is beneficial in patients with CVD.\nA meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in patients with atherosclerosis, ischemic stroke, or coronary heart disease shows that taking berberine alone does not improve lipid levels or markers of atherosclerosis but does reduce markers of inflammation when compared with routine therapy or statins. Additionally, the pooled analysis suggests that berberine reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, in patients with ischemic stroke (111362).\n\nThis meta-analysis also shows that, when taken with a statin, berberine improves lipid levels, stroke severity, markers of atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers when compared with statin therapy alone or routine treatment (111362). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low-quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization; significant heterogeneity and differences in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied; and concerns related to publication bias.\nless\nCholera. Although taking a single dose of berberine may be modestly beneficial for reducing stool volume, using berberine daily with tetracycline does not seem to provide added benefit.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume by a small amount in subjects with cholera when compared with placebo (262). However, taking berberine 200-400 mg daily along with tetracycline 500 mg four times daily does not seem to further enhance the effects of tetracycline in treating cholera-induced diarrhea (34305, 34306).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Berberine may help prevent adenoma recurrence after polypectomy.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese patients with colorectal adenomas who had undergone complete polypectomy shows that taking berberine 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 22% when compared with placebo (103197). A meta-analysis of this trial and two other small clinical studies in Chinese patients with a history of colorectal adenomas shows that taking berberine 0.1 grams three times daily for 18 months or 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 31% and 25% at years 1 and 2, respectively, when compared with placebo (110101). All available research has been conducted in China; it is unclear whether these results can be applied to other geographic locations.\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Berberine may provide additional benefit to patients with CHF who are taking conventional medications.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with CHF secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy shows that adding berberine 1.2-2 grams daily for 8 weeks to conventional medications can reduce the frequency and complexity of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and reduce mortality when compared with placebo (13520).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease treated with a percutaneous intervention (PCI) shows that taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 3 months reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to a greater extent than ezetimibe 10 mg daily. Combining this specific product with either ezetimibe or a low-dose statin produces additional improvements in all lipid parameters after 3-12 months of treatment when compared with any of the agents alone (97232, 97233). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. Because red yeast rice contains a compound identical to lovastatin (monacolin K), it is likely that the cholesterol-lowering potential of this combination is mainly attributable to the red yeast rice constituent.\nless\nDiarrhea. Limited data suggest that berberine may be helpful for diarrhea caused by bacteria.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume in subjects with Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea when compared with placebo (262).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for glaucoma when used as an eye drop.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using eye drops containing berberine 2.5 mg and tetrahydrozoline 2.5 mg for 3 days does not reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma when compared with eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline alone (34304).\nless\nHepatitis B. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with hepatitis B.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis B when compared with control (34265).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with this form of hepatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis C when compared with control (34265).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Small studies suggest that oral berberine may be beneficial in adults with prediabetes.\nA very small clinical study in adults with overweight and prediabetes shows that taking berberine aqueous root extract (HIMABERB, Pharma Base S.A.) 500 mg 3 times daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 15 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.7%, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test by 28 mg/dL and improves fasting insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (111699). The validity of these effects is limited by a very small sample size. Another small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking berberine phospholipids (Berbevis, Indena, SpA, Italy) 550 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 4 mg/dL and improves insulin levels when compared with placebo (111700).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One small clinical study suggests that oral berberine may be beneficial in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS reduces the frequency of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and defecation urgency when compared with placebo. Berberine may also improve overall symptom scores and IBS quality of life (97236). Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS, Tilman SA) providing berberine 200 mg and curcumin 42 mg orally twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments (113354). It is unclear if this effect is due to berberine, curcumin, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine plus soy isoflavones can reduce vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women when compared with taking calcium plus vitamin D (34287). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, soy isoflavones, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with MASLD.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with MASLD shows that taking berberine extract 500 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve markers of liver damage or insulin resistance, fatty liver indices, or most lipid levels when compared with placebo (114769). Also review effectiveness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a similar condition.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Berberine may reduce some of the signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome, but the evidence is weak.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking berberine hydrochloride 500 mg three times daily before meals for 3 months reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.6 kg/m2, systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg, triglycerides by 18 mg/dL, and serum glucose levels by 2 mg/dL, and can also improve insulin sensitivity, when compared with baseline (91957). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 18 weeks improves SBP, left ventricular mass, and flow-mediated dilation in patients with metabolic syndrome when compared with control (34289). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral berberine may improve some measures of liver function and blood lipids in people with NAFLD.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies and preliminary clinical research in patients with NAFLD, some with comorbid type 2 diabetes, show that taking berberine 600 mg to 6.35 grams daily, alone or in combination with metformin or lifestyle interventions, for 7 to 22 weeks reduces markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and improves body mass index (BMI), measures of insulin resistance, and most lipid parameters when compared with control and baseline (34286, 113462). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks reduces hepatic fat content by 21% when compared with lifestyle modification. Berberine also seems to reduce hepatic fat content, AST, and ALT similarly to pioglitazone 15 mg daily, while reducing body weight, body mass index, and total cholesterol more than pioglitazone (97237). Also review effectiveness in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a similar condition.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical studies, most in patients with various metabolic conditions, shows that taking berberine 300-1500 mg daily for up to 24 months reduces body weight by around 2 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.5 kg/m2, and waist circumference by about 1 cm when compared with a control group (104508). However, most of the studies are small, of varying quality, with significant heterogeneity, and likely inadequately powered to detect significant changes. Additionally, none of the studies required patients to have overweight or obesity for inclusion.\nless\nRadiation fibrosis. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for reducing radiation-induced lung damage.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 20 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks during radiation therapy reduces the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury and improves lung function in patients treated for NSCLC when compared with placebo (34253).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. One small study suggests that oral berberine may reduce diarrhea associated with radiation-induced intestinal damage.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 2 weeks can reduce the frequency and severity of radiation-induced intestinal damage and diarrhea in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy when compared with placebo (34263).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in adults with acute ischemic stroke.\nA meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in adults with acute ischemic stroke shows that taking berberine 0.3-1.0 grams daily for up to 6 months in addition to conventional therapy reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, improves markers of atherosclerosis and inflammation, and reduces triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with routine therapy as control (111698). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization. Other limitations include significant heterogeneity in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied.\nless\nThrombocytopenia. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for improving platelet counts in people with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine bisulfate 5 mg three times daily before meals for 15 days, either alone or with prednisolone, can increase platelet count in patients with primary or secondary thrombocytopenia when compared with baseline (34317).\nless\nTrachoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for trachoma when administered as eye drops.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that berberine ophthalmic solution might be useful for treating trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Solutions of 0.2% berberine have been applied three times daily for 3-12 weeks, or solutions of 0.5% three times daily for 1-3 weeks (13523, 34303, 34310, 34313).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal berberine is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nA meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking berberine orally (600-900 mg daily) or rectally (4-6 grams daily) for 3-12 weeks, in addition to mesalamine, improves the rate of patients with complete remission or reduced symptoms, such as bowel movements, blood in stools, or abdominal pain, when compared to mesalamine alone (115724). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including route of administration and treatment duration.\nless\nVentricular arrhythmias. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might lower the frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).\nData from a meta-analysis of 10 small clinical trials, all conducted in China, shows that taking oral berberine, 0.3-0.6 grams 3 or 4 times daily for 7-30 days has a similar efficacy rate to antiarrhythmic drugs, and a lower incidence of adverse effects, in the management of PVCs. A combination of berberine and antiarrhythmic drugs has a higher efficacy rate and similar adverse effect rate, when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs alone (112947). The quality of this evidence is low.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate berberine for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA\nBerberine is contraindicated in newborn infants. It can displace bilirubin from albumin and increase the risk for kernicterus, particularly in preterm neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (2589).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with berberine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBerberine has poor oral bioavailability (110098, 115723). In adults, following oral administration of berberine the maximum plasma concentration is reached in approximately 3 hours (115723). Berberine appears to be a substrate of nuclear transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter, which might explain its low oral bioavailability (13525). Dihydroberberine, a reduced derivative of berberine, has shown improved bioavailability when compared with berberine (110098).\nMetabolism\nBerberine appears to undergo phase I hepatic metabolism (13525). In vitro research suggests that cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) plays a primary role in berberine metabolism, with cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and 3A4 (CYP3A4) contributing to a lesser extent (115747). Additionally, a clinical study shows that CYP2D6 deficiency, particularly in females, affects the metabolism of berberine, leading to increased concentrations (115723). Three metabolites have been found in human urine after ingestion of berberine chloride. These are jatrorrhizine-3-sulfate, demethyleneberberine-2-sulfate, and thalifendine-10-sulfate (34212).\nExcretion\nBerberine is excreted in the urine and feces (2591, 34314).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBerberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid and a primary constituent of several plants including European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric (2589, 12426, 14003, 32322, 33598, 34206, 33658, 33713, 34207, 34210)(34211, 34221, 104508).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTwo meta-analyses of a total of 19 clinical studies show that berberine can cause a small reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of systemic inflammation (103196, 104508, 111362). A larger reduction in CRP was reported with berberine in a meta-analysis of 52 clinical studies involving patients with metabolic syndrome or other metabolic disorders. Berberine also appears to reduce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), levels in these patients (110102, 111362).\n\nAnimal research shows that berberine can reduce chemical-induced swelling, possibly by inhibiting the expression of various cytokines (13529, 33639, 34298). Preliminary and human research suggests that berberine blocks production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, possibly by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. As a result, berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha (13522, 33674, 34258, 99922). Berberine also appears to decrease the production of IL-8, which is involved in inflammatory processes (33592). Preliminary research suggests berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488, 33582, 34258).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that berberine can reduce the proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, oral squamous cell, esophageal, prostate, gastric, cervical, and breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or causing apoptosis (34196, 34202, 34219, 34222, 34229, 34233, 34236, 34237, 34238, 34315)(34323, 95716). Some preliminary research suggests that berberine can also inhibit the progression of leukemia, colon adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiform cells by inhibiting the activity of arylamine N-acetyltransferase (34197, 34198, 34206, 34214). Arylamine N-acetyltransferase has been shown to be involved in the growth and chemotherapy drug resistance of cancer (91947). Berberine also appears to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vitro by inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha repression (34226).\n\nIn addition to preventing the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, berberine may also inhibit the ability of cancer to metastasize. Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer to the lymph nodes (33587). In vitro research also shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma cells (34284).\n\nIn addition to its anticancer effects, berberine appears to enhance the effects of conventional cancer treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy, against some types of cancer. In vitro research shows that berberine can enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells to ionizing radiation (34227). Other in vitro research shows that treatment of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells with berberine and tamoxifen enhances G1 phase arrest and activates apoptosis compared to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Berberine is thought to increase the effectiveness of tamoxifen against breast cancer cells by inducing upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, which is involved with breast cancer growth and development and plays a role in tamoxifen resistance (95716).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe blood-glucose lowering effect of berberine has been attributed to its ability to increase insulin receptor expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes (34265). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that berberine increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity (34240, 34242, 34243). Activation of AMPK can stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscles, increase the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and reduce the production of glucose in the liver (91948). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion (34254). GLP-1 is an incretin that plays a role in the maintenance of glycemic control (91949). Some animal research also shows that berberine can increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-delta expression, although berberine also appears to reduce PPAR-gamma expression in the liver of diabetic rats (34249).\n\nIn addition to lowering blood glucose, berberine might also inhibit aldose reductase (13520). This might prevent nerve and eye damage in people with diabetes.\nAntidiarrheal effects\nPreliminary research in healthy individuals suggests that the antidiarrheal effect of berberine results from its ability to delay small intestinal transit time (33659). Also, evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the intestinal secretion of water, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in response to enterotoxin from Vibrio cholera and Escherichia coli (33596, 33651, 33654, 33655, 33714, 34309).\nAntilipemic effects\nBerberine is theorized to reduce lipids by enhancing hepatic uptake of low-density lipoprotein particles by inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), increasing fecal cholesterol excretion, improving hepatic cholesterol turnover, and decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption (111363). Animal research shows that the hypocholesterolemic effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption and increase bile acid synthesis (34264). Other animal research shows that berberine may improve lipid dysregulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the liver and muscles, thereby exerting effects on fatty acid oxidation, glucose generation, and insulin resistance (34257, 111364).\nAntimicrobial effects\nBerberine has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium paraputrificum, Aspergillus species, Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum (2530, 2583, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012, 12428, 33690, 33702)(33703, 33705, 34200, 34208, 34312, 34334). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540). The activity of berberine against Plasmodium falciparum might result from its ability to inhibit telomerase activity (34213).\nAntioxidant effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine increases the activity of superoxide dismutase and decreases levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide anion (34248, 34252).\nAntiplatelet effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine inhibits platelet aggregation (33660). In vitro research suggests that the antiplatelet effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (91950).\nBone effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that berberine can inhibit parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone resorption (33580). In doses of 30-50 mg/kg daily, berberine has demonstrated an ability to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density of lumbar vertebra in ovariectomized rats and induce apoptosis of osteoclastic cells (33580).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn humans, intravenous infusion of berberine appears to improve cardiac performance in patients with severe congestive heart failure (91951). The effect has been attributed to the ability of berberine to induce peripheral vasodilation and inotropic stimulation (33642). The positive inotropic effects of berberine have been confirmed in various animal models (33637, 33642, 33685, 33708, 33710). Also, in humans, oral berberine reduced myocardial injury, possibly by inhibiting the cellular pathway that causes apoptosis (99922). Berberine also appears to have an antihypertensive effect, which has been attributed to its ability to block alpha-adrenergic activity (13520). Other evidence from in vitro research suggests that berberine possesses partial alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist activity similar to that of clonidine (33606). Evidence from animal research shows that berberine has an antiarrhythmic effect and can restore ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm (33608, 33636, 33685). Berberine may increase the elasticity of the small arteries by increasing the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (34244). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can reduce oxidative stress and vascular inflammation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase activity (34281).\n\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine can improve neointima formation following balloon injury in rats. This suggests that berberine might be able to help control restenosis after balloon angioplasty (34231).\nEndocrine effects\nIn women with polycystic ovary syndrome, berberine hydrochloride has been shown to increase sex hormone binding globulin levels and decrease the free androgen index (34282).\nGastroprotective effects\nBerberine appears to reduce the secretion of gastric acid (13537).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests berberine might protect the liver from hepatotoxins. In an animal model, berberine reduced N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver injury, as evidence by the attenuation of increased liver weight, elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and increased glutathione S-transferase levels (13521). Other animal research shows that berberine prevents elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when administered prior to exposure to acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride (13519).\n\nOther animal research suggests that berberine has antifibrotic effects and can increase the excretion of bilirubin from the liver. This suggests that berberine may have beneficial effects in treating liver fibrosis (34302).\nMuscle relaxant effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that berberine can block acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscles (33646, 33692)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHyperlipidemia. Oral bergamot seems to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia. It is unclear if bergamot is beneficial for improving high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hyperlipidemia shows taking a bergamot polyphenol fraction 1000 mg orally daily for 30 days increases HDL cholesterol and decreases total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides similarly to rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, but to a lesser extent than rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. Taking the bergamot polyphenol fraction 1000 mg daily in combination with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily appears to result in similar improvements as those seen with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily (96357). A meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials shows that taking bergamot 500-1300 mg daily reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and increases HDL cholesterol levels. However, the included studies had high heterogeneity (109982). Clinical research in overweight or obese patients with mild hypercholesterolemia shows that taking bergamot phytosome (Vazguard, Indena SpA) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly decreases total and LDL cholesterol, but does not affect HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with placebo (105317). Also, preliminary clinical research in statin-intolerant patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that taking a specific bergamot extract (Bergavit, Bionap) providing 150 mg flavonoids daily for 6 months reduces LDL cholesterol and triglycerides by 20% and 17%, respectively, and increases HDL cholesterol by 8%, when compared with baseline (102599).\n\nBergamot has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, usually in lower doses than the studies with single-ingredient products, and with inconsistent results (109982). One product (Colber, Esserre Pharma srl), containing bergamot extract, phytosterols, vitamin C, and dry artichoke extract, was taken as 2 pills daily for 8 weeks (102596); another product (CitriCholess, GardaVita Inc.), containing bergamot extract 500 mg along with unspecified additional ingredients, was taken daily for 12 weeks (96366). Another specific product (Vazguard; Indena SpA), containing bergamot phytosome 600 mg and artichoke leaf extract (Indena SpA) 100 mg, has also shown benefit in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia when taken twice daily for 2 months (108712). However, it is unclear if any effects from these products are due to bergamot, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAnxiety. Inhaled bergamot essential oil does not seem to be beneficial for anxiety associated with radiotherapy treatment.\nClinical research in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy shows that using bergamot essential oil as aromatherapy does not reduce anxiety when compared with placebo (11452).\nless\nMental alertness. Inhaled bergamot essential oil does not seem to improve mental alertness.\nSome clinical research shows that using bergamot essential oil as aromatherapy does not improve mental alertness and might actually impair mental alertness in healthy people due to its relaxing effects (34438, 34440).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral bergamot is beneficial for reducing antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking bergamot extract (Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction BPF, H&AD SRL) 500 mg orally daily for 60 days along with dietary advice does not affect body weight, body mass index, glucose, or lipid parameters when compared to baseline in patients taking second generation antipsychotics (96355). The lack of a comparator group limits the validity of these results.\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral bergamot has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking two tablets of a product containing bergamot juice flavonoids, phytosterols, artichoke leaf extract, and vitamin C (ColBer, Esserre Pharma SRL) orally daily for 6 months along with dieting and exercise modestly reduces joint pain when compared to baseline (96367). The lack of a comparator group limits the validity of these results.\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if inhaled bergamot essential oil is beneficial for reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-11 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that inhaling 5 drops of bergamot essential oil on a scent strip for 15 minutes while waiting in a medical office does not reduce anxiety when compared with no aromatherapy (102597).\nless\nDepression. Inhaled bergamot essential oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in community-dwelling older adults shows that a combination of lavender, sweet orange, and bergamot essential oils in a 2:1:1 ratio, for a final combined concentration of 1% in sweet almond oil, administered via inhalation or aromatherapy massage to the upper body with 5 mL of the combination oil, twice weekly for 8 weeks improves symptoms of depression in 55% to 65% of patients when compared with control (98474). It is unclear if this benefit is associated with bergamot, other aromatherapy oils, or the combination.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral bergamot has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that taking a product containing fenugreek seed extract 200 mg, olive leaf extract 100 mg, and bergamot extract 500 mg for 6 months does not improve levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose or insulin, insulin resistance, or lipids, when compared with placebo (102251).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if inhaled bergamot essential oil is beneficial for insomnia.\nA small, crossover, open-label clinical study in young adults without insomnia shows that aromatherapy with bergamot essential oil sprayed on a towel twice daily, before bedtime and upon awakening, for 1 week improves some self-reported factors of sleep, including sleepiness upon waking and feeling refreshed upon waking, when compared with placebo (115865). However, clinical significance is unclear and generalizability is limited since the majority of participants reported sleeping well at baseline.\n\nBergamot essential oil has also been evaluated in combination therapy. Preliminary clinical research in patients hospitalized for cardiac rehabilitation shows that bedside aromatherapy with lavender, ylang ylang, and bergamot in a 1:1:1 ratio on a cotton ball for 5 nights moderately improves subjective sleep quality, but not sleep duration or sleep time, when compared with placebo (102594). It is unclear if this effect is due to bergamot, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLice.

Oral bergamot has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with both NAFLD and metabolic syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of a bergamot polyphenolic fraction 650 mg, oleuropein 20% 100 mg, and ascorbic acid 50 mg twice daily for 120 days modestly reduces levels of fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared to baseline. It also improves ultrasonographic markers of NAFLD (105318). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Bergamot polyphenolic fraction has also shown some benefit in combination with artichoke extract. In patients with NAFLD, including those with or without diabetes, clinical research shows that taking a specific product (Bergacyn, Seris srl) containing 150 mg each of these ingredients, daily for 12-16 weeks, modestly improves levels of liver markers, reduces liver fat, and reduces serum uric acid when compared with placebo (105315, 105316, 115867). It is unclear if these benefits are due to bergamot, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral bergamot is beneficial for weight loss or improving metabolic parameters in adults with obesity.\nClinical research in overweight or obese patients with mild hypercholesterolemia shows that taking bergamot phytosome (Vazguard, Indena SpA) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly decreases visceral adipose tissue and levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on body weight, fat mass, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or glycemic indices (105317). A clinical study in adults with obesity following a reduced-calorie diet and performing 30-60 minutes of daily, light-intensity exercise, shows that a specific oral product (CitruSlim; NHR Science) containing bergamot extract 83% and Eurycoma longifolia root extract 17%, taken as 200 mg or 400 mg daily as three divided doses before meals for 112 days, decreases body mass index by 3.3% and 3.2%, respectively, but does not impact lipid parameters or waist-to-hip ratio, when compared with diet and exercise alone (108452). It is unclear if this effect is due to bergamot, Eurycoma longifolia, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical bergamot is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild-moderate knee osteoarthritis receiving physical therapy shows that adding a 15-minute aromatherapy massage with bergamot essential oil twice weekly for 4 weeks to the affected knee modestly reduces pain at rest and after activity, and improves functionality, when compared with placebo or physical therapy alone (115866).\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if inhaled bergamot essential oil is beneficial for reducing depressive symptoms in postpartum adults.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults voluntarily residing in a postpartum care center in Taiwan for 1 month shows that diffusing bergamot essential oil as aromatherapy daily for 15 minutes, beginning after childbirth and continuing for approximately 3 weeks, modestly reduces scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, but not on the Postpartum Sleep Quality Scale, when compared with diffusing water. However, these patients did not have a diagnosis of postpartum depression at baseline, and depression scores improved in both groups (108992). The validity of these findings is limited by concerns with the study methodology.\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. It is unclear if inhaled bergamot essential oil is beneficial for reducing preoperative anxiety in adults or children.\nIn patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, preliminary clinical research shows that bergamot essential oil as aromatherapy has a small beneficial effect on anxiety when compared with inhalation of grape seed oil (105319). However, bergamot essential oil (Elizabeth Van Buren) as aromatherapy does not appear to help reduce anxiety in children and adolescents undergoing stem cell transplantation (90508).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical bergamot is beneficial for chronic plaque psoriasis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying bergamot essential oil topically 30 minutes prior to ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy three times weekly is no more effective than UVB therapy alone for reducing plaque severity in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The duration of treatment varied according to plaque outcome, with discontinuation occurring either after plaque resolution, or after five consecutive procedures produced no observable effects (34381).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral bergamot is beneficial for improving executive functioning in patients with schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with schizophrenia taking second generation antipsychotics shows that taking a bergamot extract product (Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction BPF, H&AD SRL) 500 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks improves some, but not all, measures of executive functioning when compared to baseline (96356). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if inhaled bergamot is beneficial for stress.\nA small quasi-experimental study in adult nurses in Taiwan shows that aromatherapy with bergamot peel essential oil, diffused at the nurse's station twice daily for 4 hours for 1 month, did not change physiological stress parameters such as blood pressure or heart rate, but did decrease some self-reported measures of work stress including work concerns and personal burnout when compared to baseline (115749). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of this result is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nVitiligo.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBergamot essential oil is made from the fruit peel, while bergamot juice is from the endocarp (96369, 96370, 96371). Bergamot juice contains high levels of citric acid, limonoids, phenols, and flavonoids such as vicenin-2, naringin, neohesperidin, neoeriocitrin, rutin, neodesmin, rhoifolin, poncirin, and brutieridin. Levels of these constituents differ slightly between cultivars (99256, 102598, 102599, 105317, 109982).\nAnxiolytic effects\nWhile its use is not supported by results from clinical research, bergamot is commonly used in aromatherapy for anxiety (11452, 90508, 102597). Although the exact mechanism of action related to the anxiolytic effects of bergamot is unclear, it does not appear to mimic the effects of benzodiazepines at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor complex (102595).\nCardiovascular effects\nBergamot contains flavonoids, including naringin, neoeriocitrin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, and the neohesperidosides butieridine and melitidine, which are structural analogs of statins and have hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitory activity. They reduce cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, increase excretion of cholesterol in the feces, and enhance vasodilation. The flavone glycosides naringenin and hersperetin reduce activity of enzymes such as phosphatidate phosphohydrolase which are involved in triglyceride synthesis, and reduce triglyceride accumulation in the liver (109982).\nDermatologic effects\nThe photosensitivity of bergamot essential oil is linked to the furocoumarin constituents, bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) (11019), and xanthotoxin (8-methoxypsoralen) (6)."

            "Overview": "Beta-alanine is a beta-amino acid, meaning that its amino group is at the second, or beta, position from the carboxylate group. Beta-alanine is a component of carnosine and other compounds, but it is not a constituent of proteins. It is found in the diet alone or as part of other compounds. Beta-alanine is also formed in the body during the breakdown of uracil or thymine (94358, 94359).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Oral beta-alanine, including a specific commercial product (CarnoSyn, Natural Alternatives International), has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 6.4 grams daily for 12 weeks in younger adults (14611, 16025, 16439, 16441, 18227, 94357, 97972, 101028, 101029, 104144, 106717), and up to 3.2 grams daily for 12 weeks in adults aged 55 years and older (16442, 97955, 97961, 97965).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using in medicinal amounts.",

This generally starts on the scalp within 20 minutes of the dose, spreading to most of the body, and lasting for about an hour. This was described as severe at a dose of 40 mg/kg, tolerable at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and very mild at a dose of 10 mg/kg. At the lowest dose it only occurred in 25% of subjects (16438). In some studies, beta-alanine has been given as frequently as 8 times per day so that each dose can be kept below 10 mg/kg (16438, 16439). Other clinical research shows that taking beta-alanine in a tablet formulation eliminates the presence of parasthesias at a dose of 1.6 grams when compared with a solution made from powdered beta-alanine. This effect may be due to delayed absorption (97974, 97975). Although paresthesias still occur with sustained-release formulations, their presence is less frequent when compared with immediate-release formulations (101029).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. In some adults, taking beta-alanine appears to improve some, but not all, measures of athletic performance. Beta-alanine appears to work better for exercises that lasts at least 1 minute in duration; however, many other factors likely alter efficacy, such as the type of exercise, the subject's training experience, and the dosing regimen.\nMany small clinical trials have evaluated the effects of beta-alanine supplementation in untrained individuals, recreational athletes, and professional athletes in a variety of sports and activities, including running, cycling, swimming, basketball, football, soccer, rowing, water polo, wrestling, weight lifting, skiing, and others. However, the results of individual trials are conflicting. Furthermore, studies have included multiple endpoints that have been both lab-based, such as time to exhaustion, strength endurance, time trials, and power output, and field-based, such as performance times (18227, 94333, 94334, 94335, 94336, 94337, 94338, 94339, 94340, 94341)(94342, 94343, 94345, 94346, 94347, 94348, 94349, 97956, 97958, 97960)(97962, 97969, 97970, 97971, 97972, 101027, 101028, 101029, 101030, 104144)(104145, 106710, 106711, 106713, 106717, 106718, 112794).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical trials show that taking beta-alanine 2-6.4 grams orally daily for 3-12 weeks provides minor improvements in exercise capacity and performance when compared with control (18227, 94357, 106717). In one meta-analysis, exercise capacity improved by an average of approximately 3% when compared with placebo (18227). However, meta-analyses suggest that improvements in exercise performance are less than exercise capacity (18227, 94357). The majority of this research has only included males. Preliminary clinical research assessing the effect of beta-alanine on exercise capacity in females has not consistently demonstrated a benefit. However, the validity of these studies is limited by small sample sizes (14611, 94338, 94339, 94345, 97957, 97967, 104144, 112791).\n\nPreliminary clinical research also suggests that beta-alanine is more effective for short exercises, lasting at least 1 minute. Longer exercises, lasting more than 10 minutes, have not been well studied. In addition, the type of athlete and type of exercise most likely to benefit from beta-alanine supplementation is unclear (18227, 94357, 106717).\n\nPooled analyses have not identified the most effective dose of beta-alanine; however, preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that prolonged supplementation of at least 3-6 weeks may be needed to gain benefits (94357, 106717). There does not seem to be a relationship between the daily beta-alanine dose and exercise-related outcomes, although one analysis suggests outcomes may be related to the total cumulative dose; most studies have used a total daily dose of 2.4-6.4 grams (18227, 94357, 101026, 101027, 101028, 101029, 101030, 106712, 106717).\n\nThe majority of studies have evaluated various marketed formulations of beta-alanine (Carnosyn, Natural Alternatives International; Sustained Release Beta-Alanine, Musashi; Balance 100% unflavored pure beta-alanine, Vitaco Health; Intra X cell, Athletics Edge Nutrition) (94333, 94335, 94336, 94337, 94339, 94342, 94346, 94347, 94348, 94349)(101028, 101029, 101030, 104144, 106710, 106711, 106718).\n\nBeta-alanine has also been studied in combination with 1 additional ingredient, namely sodium bicarbonate or creatine. Preliminary clinical research in physically active or trained males shows that taking beta-alanine 6-6.4 grams orally daily for 4-6 weeks with sodium bicarbonate 300-500 mg/kg orally daily for 1-7 days does not increase exercise capacity or exercise performance while cycling or sprinting when compared with individual supplementation (97959, 97964, 97966, 101028). In contrast, preliminary clinical research in male athletes participating in martial arts or rowing shows that taking beta-alanine with sodium bicarbonate modestly increases exercise performance when compared with either ingredient taken alone (97962, 97963). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy, untrained males shows that taking beta-alanine 1.6 grams daily for 28 days with creatine 5 grams twice daily for 22 days, followed by four times daily for 6 days, modestly increases power output during cycling when compared with placebo or taking either supplement alone (97973). In another very small clinical study in trained military males, taking beta-alanine 6.4 grams daily for 28 days with creatine 0.3 grams/kg daily for the last 7 days improves leg muscle power but not anaerobic power or muscle strength when compared with beta-alanine plus placebo (112793).\n\nBeta-alanine has also been studied in combination with multiple other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing beta-alanine, creatine monohydrate, arginine, alpha-ketoisocaproate, and leucine (NO-Shotgun) or a different product containing beta-alanine, L-histidine, and carnosine (BETAFOR3MAX, Martinez Nieto S.A.) for 28 or 7 days, respectively, also improves strength and power output when compared with placebo (34451, 106714). However, another very small crossover clinical study in healthy males shows that taking 6 mg/kg of a multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement containing beta-alanine, L-tyrosine, L-citrulline maleate, arginine alpha-ketoglutarate, L-taurine, and caffeine 30 minutes prior to weight training does not increase bench press strength endurance when compared with an equivalent amount of anhydrous caffeine (111250). It is unclear if these effects are due to beta-alanine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPhysical performance. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking beta-alanine improves exercise capacity and fatigue, but not strength or exercise performance, in older adults.\nClinical research in older adults shows that taking beta-alanine 2.4-3.2 grams daily for 4-12 weeks increases exercise capacity and delays fatigue during exercise when compared with placebo (16442, 97955, 97965). In addition, preliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement fortified with beta-alanine 0.8-1.2 grams twice daily for 12 weeks increases exercise capacity when compared with taking the oral nutritional supplement alone (97961). Taking beta-alanine 2.4 grams daily also minimizes the reduction of executive functioning after cycling in older adults when compared with placebo (97955).\n\nHowever, 2 clinical studies in older adults show that taking beta-alanine (Natural Alternatives International) 2.4-3.2 grams daily for 10-12 weeks with or without an endurance-based resistance-training program does not improve strength, power, fatigue, or performance when compared with the resistance training program alone or placebo (101031, 112792).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral beta-alanine is beneficial for cognitive decline in older adults.\nA small clinical study in older adults shows that taking beta-alanine 1200 mg twice daily for 10 weeks reduces symptoms of depression and might improve cognitive function in subjects with borderline or low cognitive function at baseline when compared with placebo. However, beta-alanine supplementation does not improve cognitive function in older adults with normal cognitive function at baseline and does not benefit mood, anxiety, or executive function when compared with placebo (112792).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral beta-alanine improves physical function in people with COPD.\nA small clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking beta-alanine (SR CarnoSyn, Natural Alternatives International, Inc) 800 mg four times daily for 12 weeks does not improve exercise capacity, muscle function, or physical activity when compared with placebo (112790).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral beta-alanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in trained military males shows that taking beta-alanine 6.4 grams daily for 28 days with creatine 0.3 grams/kg daily for the last 7 days modestly improves mathematical processing when compared to baseline, but not when compared with beta-alanine plus placebo. However, improvement from baseline was not found in the group taking beta-alanine plus placebo (112793).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there has been interest in using oral beta-alanine for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-alanine for this purpose.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral beta-alanine improves body composition in adults.\nA meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in active and sedentary adults shows that supplementing with beta-alanine 1.6-6.4 grams daily for 3-10 weeks does not reduce body mass, fat mass, body fat percentage, or free fat mass when compared with various controls. Subgroup analysis of dose, duration, and type of additional training did not change the results (112789).\nless\nSarcopenia. Although there has been interest in using oral beta-alanine for sarcopenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-alanine for this purpose.\nExercise-induced muscle breakdown. It is unclear if oral beta-alanine improves muscle recovery after exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in untrained adults shows that taking beta-alanine 4.8 grams orally daily for 4 weeks does not improve muscle recovery after resistance exercises when compared with placebo (101026).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate beta-alanine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBeta-alanine has been used in doses of 1.6-6.4 grams daily as 1-8 divided doses for up to 12 weeks. In older adults, beta-alanine has most often been used in daily doses of 2.4-3.2 grams. In some clinical trials, beta-alanine is titrated to the target dose over several weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBeta-alanine products are available in immediate- and sustained-release formulations (14611, 16442, 34445, 34447, 94333, 94335, 94336, 94342, 94346, 94337)(94347, 94348, 94349, 101028, 101029, 101030, 101031).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "None known.",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with beta-alanine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDifferent oral formulations of beta-alanine can alter absorption rates. Taking beta-alanine as a tablet results in a 68% reduction in peak plasma concentration, with no change in the area under the curve (AUC), when compared with a solution made from a powdered formulation (Carnosyn, Natural Alternatives International) (97974). The time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 30-40 minutes for the solution (16438, 97974) and 60 minutes for the tablet (97974).\nMetabolism\nCarnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is synthesized from beta-alanine and L-histidine in muscles and cells of the CNS by the enzyme carnosine synthetase (3381, 3391, 16438, 16442). After supplementation with beta-alanine, muscle carnosine levels are increased within 4 weeks of initiation (16024, 16441, 16439, 34449, 34442, 101029, 106712). The increase in carnosine muscle concentration appears to be correlated to the total dose, but not the daily dose, of beta-alanine consumed over the treatment period (97975, 106712). Taking beta-alanine 100 grams over 8 weeks corresponds to an approximate 2 mmol/kg increase in muscle carnosine (97975). Also, the increase in muscle carnosine is greater following use of sustained-release versus immediate-release formulations (101029).\nExcretion\nWhen beta-alanine is taken orally, the plasma half-life is about 25 minutes (16438). After discontinuing chronic oral beta-alanine supplementation, skeletal muscle carnosine levels return to baseline after 12-16 weeks (106715). Small amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine (16438), with only 3.7% and 1.1% of total beta-alanine excreted in the urine after consumption of solution and tablet formulations, respectively (97974).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeta-alanine is the only naturally occurring beta-amino acid. Its chemical formula is NH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, putting the amino group at the beta-position (i.e., two carbon atoms away) from the carboxylate group. Therefore, unlike alpha-alanine, it does not have a chiral center or optical isomers. Beta-alanine is formed in the liver as a result of uracil and thymine degradation, but in meat-eating animals it is primarily obtained from the diet (3381, 3391, 16438). Beta-alanine is not used by the body in the synthesis of proteins, but it is a component of the dipeptides carnosine and anserine, and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is synthesized from beta-alanine and L-histidine in muscles and cells of the CNS by the enzyme carnosine synthetase (3381, 3391, 16438, 16442).\nAnti-aging effects\nAging is associated with a significant reduction in skeletal muscle carnosine levels. Supplementation with beta-alanine in older adults and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may improve physical performance (16442, 112790). A clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking beta-alanine (SR CarnoSyn) 800 mg four times daily for 12 weeks increases muscle carnosine concentration by 54% from baseline. However, the increase in muscle carnosine did not correlate to improved exercise capacity, muscle function, or indicators of muscle oxidative or carbonyl stress (112790).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nThere is interest in using beta-alanine, alone or in combination with carnosine, for diabetes. However, a very small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes failed to demonstrate a difference in fasting blood glucose after taking beta-alanine orally 4 grams daily for 4 weeks when compared with placebo (106716).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA very small clinical study in young collegiate basketball players shows that taking beta-alanine 6.4 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 or C-reactive protein when compared with placebo (112794).\nAntioxidant effects\nA very small study in female basketball players shows that taking beta-alanine 6.4 grams daily for 4 weeks does not reduce exercise-induced elevations in biomarkers of oxidative damage, including malondialdehyde, creatine kinase, or lactate dehydrogenase (112791).\nAthletic performance effects\nCarnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is synthesized from beta-alanine and L-histidine in muscles and cells of the CNS by the enzyme carnosine synthetase (3381, 3391, 16438, 16442). Since there are plentiful supplies of L-histidine, beta-alanine availability is the rate-limiting factor in carnosine synthesis (16024, 16438). Carnosine is concentrated in actively contracting muscle and is thought to play a role in the contractility of muscle tissue (3390). It acts as a buffer to prevent the build-up of hydrogen ions in myocytes which contributes to muscle fatigue (14611, 16024, 16442). However, most studies in trained and untrained adults show that taking beta-alanine does not affect serum lactate levels after exercise when compared with placebo (34450, 94334, 94335, 94336, 94337, 94338, 94340, 94342, 94343, 94349)(97971, 106710, 106718, 112794). However, a study of trained female basketball players shows that taking supplemental beta-alanine for 4 weeks reduces lactate accumulation following exhaustive exercise (112791).\n\nMuscle carnosine levels can be increased by intensive training alone (16438, 16440), but are also increased by ingestion of beta-alanine supplements (14611, 16024, 16438, 16439, 97955, 97971, 106711, 112790). Preliminary research also suggests that performance improvements increase with the total cumulative dose of beta-alanine (106712). In young males taking 4-6.4 grams daily of beta-alanine for 4 to 10 weeks, skeletal muscle carnosine levels increased by 59% at 4 weeks and 80% at 10 weeks (16439).\n\nIn older adults, taking beta-alanine 1.6 grams twice daily for 12 weeks resulted in increased muscle carnosine levels that mirrored the increases seen in young males (97965, 112790). Preliminary studies with beta-alanine in humans suggest the enhanced muscle buffering capacity associated with these increased muscle carnosine levels can delay onset of neuromuscular fatigue and exhaustion, and increase the total work done during exercise (14611, 16025, 16439, 16440, 106715, 106712).\n\nResearch in soldiers involved in combat-specific activity shows that beta-alanine supplementation does not increase brain carnosine levels (97958). Beta-alanine also does not seem to affect the levels of hormones, such as cortisol, testosterone, and growth hormone, which occur in response to exercise stress (16440).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using beta-alanine to prevent age-related muscle loss. However, preliminary clinical research in older adults with or without sarcopenia shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement fortified with beta-alanine 800-1200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not seem to affect fat mass, body weight, or gripping strength when compared with taking the oral nutritional supplement alone (97961).\nTaurine effects\nBeta-alanine is an antagonist of taurine uptake into tissues because it shares the same transporter. In humans, beta-alanine can cause a dose-dependent increase in plasma taurine levels. In animals, 3 to 4 weeks of supplementation with very high doses of beta-alanine decreases taurine levels in the brain, myocardium, and skeletal muscle (16438). However, 4 weeks of supplementation with beta-alanine 6.4 grams/day did not change muscle taurine levels in humans (16439)."

    "Beta-Carotene": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Beta-carotene is a pigmented, fat-soluble compound called a carotenoid. Carotenoids are dietary precursors to vitamin A and are converted to vitamin A in the body (7135). Beta-carotene is found in green leafy and orange vegetables, some fruit, and some tree nuts (34490, 34617). Like other carotenoids, beta-carotene is considered to be an antioxidant (93095).\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends obtaining beta-carotene and other antioxidants from a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rather than through supplements (1440). Similar statements have been released by the American Cancer Society, the World Cancer Research Institute in association with the American Institute for Cancer Research, and the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (1470).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Beta-carotene supplements are appropriate for certain specific conditions; however, beta-carotene supplementation is not recommended for the general population (4844, 6393). There is no tolerable upper intake level (UL) set for beta-carotene. However, doses as low as 20 mg/day have been associated with increased risk of lung and prostate cancer in people who smoke (1371, 3359, 3937, 3959, 6393, 11786). There is also concern that taking high doses of antioxidants such as beta-carotene might do more harm than good. In several analyses of clinical studies involving smokers and healthy non-smokers, taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants is associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes (15305, 34514, 90775).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses or in people who smoke or have a history of asbestos exposure. Supplemental beta-carotene 20 mg daily for 5-8 years seems to increase the risk of lung cancer, prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality in people who smoke cigarettes or have a history of high-level exposure to asbestos (1371, 3359, 3937, 3959, 6393, 11786, 34591). There is also concern that taking high doses of antioxidants such as beta-carotene might do more harm than good in the general population. In several analyses of clinical studies involving smokers and healthy non-smokers, taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants is associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes (15305, 34514, 90775).\n\nBeta-carotene from foods does not seem to have this effect.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (4844). High doses (greater than 60 mg per day) have been used with apparent safety for specific conditions such as erythropoietic protoporphyria (11793).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (4844, 6393). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of large doses of beta-carotene in pregnancy and lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, beta-carotene is well-tolerated when used in appropriate amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Belching, orange skin (temporary).\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Increased cardiovascular mortality and cancer risk in smokers and other specific patient populations.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, beta-carotene 20 to 30 mg daily seems to increase cardiovascular mortality by 12% to 26% in people who smoke (2642, 3949, 108641). Smokers and people with a history of asbestos exposure should not use beta-carotene supplements. In males who smoke and have had a prior myocardial infarction (MI), the risk of fatal coronary heart disease increases by as much as 43% with beta-carotene 20 mg daily (3937). These adverse effects do not seem to occur in people who eat foods high in beta-carotene content (1440, 2657).\nless\nDermatologic\nHigh oral doses of beta-carotene in foods or supplements can cause yellow or orange skin pigmentation called carotenoderma (11786, 34572, 34594, 91382, 108641). In clinical trials, the incidence of carotenoderma has been reported to be up to 15.8% (34626).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, beta-carotene may cause belching (34572, 34594).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn a case report, treatment with a high dose of beta-carotene and canthaxanthin for more than 6 years resulted in the development of glistening bright yellow crystalline deposits around the maculae. This resulted in a slight decrease in visual acuity and adaptation to the dark (34641).\nless\nOncologic\nSmokers and people with a history of asbestos exposure should not use beta-carotene supplements. Beta-carotene in doses of 20 mg per day for 5-8 years has been associated with an increased risk of lung and prostate cancer and increased total mortality in people who smoke cigarettes (21 or more daily), and in people with a history of high-level asbestos exposure (3959, 6393, 11303, 11786, 104467, 108641). These adverse effects do not seem to occur in people who eat foods high in beta-carotene content (1440, 2657). There is also concern that beta-carotene might increase the risk of adverse outcomes in non-smokers. In one large-scale population study, males who took a multivitamin more than 7 times per week and who also took a separate beta-carotene supplement had a significantly increased risk of developing advanced prostate cancer (15607).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nClinical research shows that taking beta-carotene 20 mg daily, alone or along with vitamin E 50 mg daily, increases the risk of common colds by 21% to 25% in individuals participating in heavy exercise at leisure. However, it does not appear to affect the risk of common cold in individuals who participate in heavy activity at work (34508).\nless\nOther\nAnalysis of studies in smokers and non-smokers suggests that taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants increases the risk of mortality from all causes (15305).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nErythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Oral beta-carotene reduces photosensitivity in patients with EPP.\nOral beta-carotene can reduce photosensitivity in patients with EPP, a genetic disorder resulting in defective porphyrin metabolism. In adults, beta-carotene 180-300 mg daily is used. In children 1-4 years old, the daily dose is 60-90 mg; 5-8 years, 90-120 mg; 9-12 years, 120-150 mg; 13-16 years, 150-180 mg; and 16 and older, 180 mg. If an adequate response is not obtained, beta-carotene can be increased by 30-60 mg per day for children under 16 years, and up to a maximum of 300 mg per day for children 16 years and older (11793, 34455, 34646, 34651, 34652, 34653, 34673).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBreast cancer. A diet rich in beta-carotene modestly reduces breast cancer risk.\nObservational research has found that a diet rich in beta-carotene is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal adults, especially those at high risk due to family history or high alcohol intake (1444, 10132). Other observational research has also found that increased beta-carotene intake is associated with up to an 18% decreased risk of breast cancer and up to a 30% increased overall survival in breast cancer patients (10824, 101697).\nless\nPostpartum complications. Taking beta carotene orally seems to reduce the occurrence of postpartum diarrhea, fever, night blindness, and mortality in malnourished patients.\nA large clinical study in pregnant patients in Nepal shows that taking all-trans beta-carotene (synthetic beta-carotene) 42 mg weekly before, during, and after pregnancy reduces, but does not eliminate, the occurrence of postpartum diarrhea, fever, and night blindness when compared with placebo (2581). Further clinical studies in pregnant patients in Nepal show that taking the same dose of all-trans beta-carotene seems to reduce pregnancy-related mortality, but not fetal and early infant mortality, when compared with placebo (6152, 6153, 6154).\nless\nSunburn. Oral beta-carotene seems to modestly reduce the risk for sunburn in sensitive individuals.\nA meta-analysis of multiple clinical studies suggests that beta-carotene must be taken for at least 10 weeks to have a protective effect against sunburn (34562). There is also some evidence that taking beta-carotene 25 mg, alone or as a mixture of beta-carotenoids, daily for 12 weeks reduces skin redness after exposure to UV light in sun-sensitive individuals (6134, 34496). However, beta-carotene is unlikely to have much effect on sunburn risk in most people (11792). Also, it does not seem to reduce the incidence of solar keratoses or skin cancers associated with sun exposure (1297, 2599, 11302).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce Alzheimer disease risk.\nMost research suggests that intake of dietary or supplemental beta-carotene does not seem to have any effect on Alzheimer disease risk (10131, 34597, 34624, 90082).\nless\nCataracts. Oral beta-carotene supplements do not seem to reduce the risk of cataract development.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest DIETARY intake of beta-carotene is associated with a modest 7% to 10% reduction in the risk of cataracts (90786, 101699). However, taking beta-carotene SUPPLEMENTS does not seem to reduce the risk of cataracts. Clinical research and meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking beta-carotene alone or in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc for up to 8 years does not reduce the incidence of cataracts or the need for cataract surgery (7304, 34626, 101699).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with cystic fibrosis shows that taking beta-carotene orally 10-300 mg daily for up to 14 months does not improve lung function when compared with control (34605).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of developing diabetes or diabetic complications.\nObservational research has found inconsistent results regarding an association between dietary beta-carotene and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004, 34576, 107292). However, one population study in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that an increased serum concentration of beta-carotene is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality over 14 years, with a 2.5-fold increased risk when the highest levels are compared with the lowest (109768).\n\nAdditionally, clinical research has been negative. One clinical study in females with a history of cardiovascular disease shows that taking beta-carotene 50 mg on alternate days does not prevent the development of type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo (34588). Another clinical study in males diagnosed with diabetes shows that taking beta-carotene 20 mg daily does not reduce the risk of macrovascular complications or mortality when compared with those not taking beta-carotene (34593).\nless\nDysplastic nevi (atypical moles). Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce atypical moles.\nClinical research in patients with numerous atypical moles shows that taking beta-carotene orally 50 mg daily for 36 months does not reduce the occurrence of newly developed moles when compared with placebo (34503).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce esophageal cancer risk.\nWhile observational research suggests that consuming more beta-carotene in the diet reduces esophageal cancer, higher quality research does not agree (103675). Clinical research shows that taking beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol supplements for 5-8 years does not reduce the incidence of upper digestive tract cancer, including esophageal cancer, in male smokers aged 50-69 years of age (34547). Additionally, a meta-analysis of low quality clinical research suggests that taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants, such as vitamin A or vitamin E plus vitamin C, does not reduce the risk of esophageal cancer and may increase mortality (12185).\nless\nLiver cancer. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce liver cancer risk.\nClinical research in male smokers aged 50-69 years shows that taking beta-carotene 20 mg daily, alone or with vitamin E 50 mg daily, for 5-8 years does not reduce the incidence of liver cancer when compared with placebo (91383).\nless\nLiver disease. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce mortality from liver disease in male smokers.\nClinical research in male smokers aged 50-69 years shows that taking beta-carotene 20 mg daily alone or with vitamin E 50 mg daily for 5-8 years does not reduce the risk of mortality due to chronic liver disease when compared with placebo (91383).\nless\nOverall mortality. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce all-cause mortality.\nSome meta-analyses published between 2007 and 2013 show that taking beta-carotene in doses of up to 50 mg daily or every other day, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, for up to 12 years increases the risk of overall mortality by 5% to 7% (15305, 34622, 90775). However, a more recent meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking beta-carotene in doses up to 75 mg daily for up to 12 years does not affect the risk of overall mortality (109767). Additionally, some research shows that taking beta-carotene 6 mg daily in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc for approximately 7 years might lower all-cause mortality in males, but not females (14109). It is unclear if any beneficial effects are related to beta-carotene, the other antioxidants, or the combination. With regard to dietary beta-carotene, a meta-analysis of population studies suggests that each 5000 mcg/day of increased intake is associated with an 8% reduction in mortality. In addition, each 25 mcg/dL increase in beta-carotene blood concentration is associated with a 19% reduction in mortality (109779).\nless\nStroke. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce stroke risk and may actually increase risk in some patients.\nTaking all-trans beta-carotene (synthetic beta-carotene) 20 mg daily orally for a median of 6 years does not reduce the overall incidence of stroke in male smokers (1371, 34514). Additionally, there is some evidence that beta-carotene actually increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage by 62% in patients who also drink alcohol (1371, 3359). However, evidence with dietary intake of beta-carotene is in contrast. A meta-analysis of population studies suggests that beta-carotene is associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of stroke per 5000 mcg/day of increased dietary intake and 15% reduction in risk of stroke per 25 mcg/dL increase in beta-carotene blood concentration (109779).\nless\nAneurysm. Oral beta-carotene does not seem to reduce abdominal aneurysm risk.\nClinical research shows that taking beta-carotene 20 mg daily does not reduce the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in male smokers when compared to patients not taking beta-carotene after a follow-up period of 5.8 years (34462).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nCancer. Oral beta-carotene does not reduce the risk of most cancer types.\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that the harms of beta-carotene supplementation outweigh the potential benefits for prevention of cancer and therefore recommends against its use (108641, 112166). Taking beta-carotene 20-50 mg daily, or 50 mg on alternate days, does not reduce the incidence of a variety of cancers in adults, including uterine, cervical, thyroid, bladder, skin (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), brain, and blood cancers (140, 1297, 1448, 2599, 2642, 2646, 2657, 3949, 34580, 34612). Additionally, meta-analyses of multiple clinical studies show that beta-carotene supplementation does not decrease cancer-related mortality and can actually increase the risk of bladder cancer by 52% and lung cancer by 14% (34612, 109767). Similarly, a meta-analysis of several population studies does not suggest that high versus low dietary beta-carotene intake is associated with reduced cancer risk. However, this analysis does suggest that each 25 mcg/dL increase in blood levels of beta-carotene is associated with a 24% lower risk of cancer (109779).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral beta-carotene does not reduce the risk of CVD, and supplementation may increase CVD-related mortality risk in some patients.\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that the harms of beta-carotene supplementation outweigh the potential benefits for prevention of CVD and therefore recommends against its use (108641, 112166). Also, a Science Advisory from the American Heart Association states that the evidence does not justify use of antioxidants such as beta-carotene for reducing the risk of CVD (12142). Although large population studies of serum, dietary, or supplemental beta-carotene have found mixed effects of beta-carotene on CVD risk (3933, 7386, 7387, 34566, 101698, 107290, 109768, 109779), most controlled clinical trials show either no effect or a negative effect on CVD incidence and/or mortality (1448, 2642, 2646, 2657, 3935, 3949, 7388, 9817, 10130, 14108, 34552, 34668). A meta-analysis of these and other randomized controlled trials in various populations shows that beta-carotene supplementation is associated with a modestly increased CVD incidence (109769). Meta-analyses also show that beta-carotene supplementation either increases CVD mortality or is not associated with CVD mortality (109767, 109769). Some evidence suggests that the risk of CVD mortality is greatest in people who smoke (2642, 3937, 3949). Most studies have used beta-carotene in doses of 20-50 mg daily or every other day, alone or in combination with other antioxidants (1448, 2642, 2646, 2657, 3935, 3937, 3949, 7388, 9817, 10130, 14108, 34552, 34668, 109767, 109769). The adverse effects of beta-carotene on CVD risk and/or mortality do not seem to occur in people who eat foods high in beta-carotene content (1440, 2657, 7714, 7715, 7716).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral beta-carotene supplementation does not reduce the risk of colorectal adenomas and may actually increase the risk in some patients.\nMost clinical studies show that taking beta-carotene 20-75 mg daily or 50 mg on alternate days does not decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas when compared with placebo (3953, 3955, 34612, 34658). One clinical study shows that beta-carotene supplementation does not decrease the risk of adenoma recurrence in most patients with previous adenoma removal. Although it may decrease the risk of adenoma recurrence by 44% in patients who never smoke nor consume alcohol, it may actually increase the risk of adenoma recurrence by 107% in those patients who smoke and drink more than one alcoholic beverage daily (34500). Also, taking beta-carotene along with vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and calcium carbonate for 3 years does not reduce colorectal polyp growth when compared with placebo (12185, 34676).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral beta-carotene does not reduce the risk of lung cancer, and supplemental beta-carotene may actually increase lung cancer risk in some people.\nTaking beta-carotene 20-30 mg daily seems to increase the risk of lung cancer by 18% to 28% in people who smoke (especially those smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day), former smokers, people exposed to asbestos, and those who ingest significant amounts of alcohol (one or more drinks per day) in addition to smoking (139, 1471, 2582, 2642, 3949, 11303, 11786, 34522, 34663, 109770). A meta-analysis of clinical research in various populations shows that taking beta-carotene supplements increases the risk of lung cancer mortality by 14%; smoking status was not specified in this analysis (109767). However, beta-carotene from food does not seem to have this adverse effect. In patients diagnosed with lung cancer, clinical evidence shows that taking a combination of beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium does not decrease lung cancer-related mortality when compared with placebo after 5.25 years of use (34539).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral beta-carotene supplementation does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer in most males, and may actually increase risk in some people.\nThe majority of reliable evidence shows that beta-carotene does not decrease prostate cancer risk in most people (148, 1473, 2406, 7895, 12877, 34612). A large study in healthy males shows that taking 50 mg of beta-carotene every other day for nearly 13 years has no overall protective effect. However, some subgroups may benefit, such as those with low beta-carotene levels, low lycopene levels, or high body mass index (1447, 1473, 12877, 14124). Some research suggests that a combination of beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc might reduce the risk of prostate cancer in patients with normal PSA levels (14135). However, the benefit might be due to the other ingredients.\n\nThere is also some concern that beta-carotene supplements might actually increase the risk of prostate cancer in some people. A large-scale population study shows that taking a multivitamin more than 7 times per week and also taking a separate beta-carotene supplement increases the risk of developing advanced prostate cancer (15607). Similarly, a large-scale clinical trial shows that smokers who take a beta-carotene supplement 20 mg daily for 5-8 years have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer (3959).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral beta-carotene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking an antioxidant combination including beta-carotene 15 mg, vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and zinc 80 mg daily reduces the odds of progression to advanced AMD by up to 31%. In patients with more severe AMD, this combination reduces the odds of progression to advanced AMD by 34%. This combination also reduces the odds of visual acuity loss by up to 29% in patients with severe AMD (7303, 11326, 90069). Evidence for the use of beta-carotene in low-risk patients with AMD is conflicting (6583, 6584, 7303).\n\nThere is contradictory evidence about the role of dietary beta-carotene for reducing the risk of developing AMD. Some evidence suggests that increasing dietary intake of beta-carotene might decrease the risk of developing AMD by up to 43% (5922). Other evidence suggests that increasing dietary beta-carotene alone does not reduce the risk of AMD. Increasing beta-carotene consumption also does not seem to be associated with a lower risk of age-related maculopathy (14007, 34564). However, consuming above average amounts of dietary beta-carotene along with other nutrients such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and zinc might reduce risk of AMD by up to 35% (14257).\nless\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving wrinkles and skin elasticity.\nA small study in females over 50 years of age shows that taking beta-carotene 30 mg daily for 90 days improves facial wrinkles and some measures of skin elasticity when compared with baseline. However, a dose of 90 mg daily does not seem to be beneficial (91381). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving symptoms of ALS.\nOne large observational cohort study has found that supplemental beta-carotene 20 mg daily is not associated with reduced risk of ALS (90087). However, a meta-analysis of 5 observational cohort studies has found that the highest dietary intake of beta-carotene is associated with a 15% reduced risk of ALS when compared with the lowest intakes (90412).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for preventing or treating anxiety.\nOne observational study of middle-aged females has found that higher dietary intake of beta-carotene is associated with lower odds of anxiety during perimenopause, but not prior to menopause. Perimenopausal individuals with the highest dietary intake of beta-carotene had a 29% reduction in the odds of anxiety when compared with the lowest intakes (107288).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for asthma prevention.\nObservational research has found that dietary beta-carotene is not associated with a reduced incidence of asthma in children or adults (34567, 107291). However, other observational research has found that a higher dietary intake of beta-carotene is associated with up to 33% lower odds of having asthma when compared with a lower dietary intake (109765). The effects of supplemental beta-carotene are unclear.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving COPD.\nThe prevalence of bronchitis and dyspnea in male smokers with COPD seems to be lower in those patients who consume a diet containing high amounts of beta-carotene (2580). However, taking beta-carotene supplements does not seem to help (2580).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving cognitive function and memory.\nObservational research has found that consuming more beta-carotene in the diet over 22 years is associated with lower odds of poor cognitive function (104468). However, it is unclear if beta-carotene supplements are beneficial. Some clinical research shows that taking beta-carotene 50 mg on alternate days for 1 year does not improve cognitive performance, including verbal memory, when compared with placebo in older males, long-term treatment of up to 18 years shows improvement in these outcomes (34558).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for CHD.\nA meta-analysis of several population studies suggests that beta-carotene is associated with an 18% reduced risk of CHD per 5000 mcg/day of increased dietary intake and a 20% reduction in risk of CHD per 25 mcg/dL increase in beta-carotene blood concentration (109779).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for depression.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that dietary intake of beta-carotene is inversely associated with depression. The highest intake of beta-carotene was associated with a 37% reduced risk of depression when compared with the lowest. Also, intakes of beta-carotene were lower in individuals with depression (109743). The effect of beta-carotene supplementation is unclear.\nless\nExercise-induced asthma. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving exercise-induced asthma symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults with exercise-induced asthma shows that taking a mixture of beta-carotene isomers 64 mg daily for 1 week seems to prevent asthma symptoms after 7 minutes of exercise (1474).\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for fracture prevention.\nObservational research has found that increased beta-carotene consumption in the diet is associated with a lower fracture risk. Geographically, the reduced risk seems to be most prevalent in China and Singapore, while the risk reduction was not significant in the US and Europe (104466).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients at risk for gastric cancer shows that taking beta-carotene orally 30 mg daily might increase regression of precancerous gastric lesions when compared with placebo (2579). It is unclear if this translates to decreased gastric cancer risk. In a meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research, beta-carotene did not decrease risk of gastric cancer when compared with placebo (12185). Beta-carotene in combination with vitamins A, C, and E also did not reduce gastric cancer risk (12185, 34545). However, in a population of high-risk, malnourished Chinese adults, taking beta-carotene 15 mg daily plus vitamin E and selenium was associated with a decrease in gastric cancer incidence, but not mortality, when compared with placebo (2658, 12185).\nless\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for hearing loss.\nPopulation research suggests that the highest dietary intake of beta-carotene is associated with a 12% decreased risk of developing self-reported hearing loss over a 22-year follow up period when compared with the lowest dietary intake (109807). Additionally, a small study in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss shows that taking beta-carotene 26000 IU, ascorbic acid 200 mg, d-alpha-tocopherol 200 IU, and selenium 50 mcg twice daily for 30 days in addition to standard treatment improves hearing to a greater degree than standard treatment alone (101700).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nA small clinical study shows that taking beta-carotene 120 mg daily for 14 days, in combination with conventional Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, does not improve the rate of eradication when compared with conventional eradication therapy alone (34472).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for HIV outcomes.\nA small clinical study in HIV-positive patients shows that taking beta-carotene 180 mg daily for one month increases total white blood cell count, CD4 cell counts, and CD4/CD8 ratios when compared with placebo (34667). However, taking the same dose of beta-carotene for a longer duration of 3 months does not improve these outcomes when compared with placebo in HIV-infected patients (34671).\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving infant motor development.\nObservational research has found that a higher level of beta-carotene in breastmilk is associated with improved infant motor development when compared with lower levels (102157).\nless\nInfluenza. Beta-carotene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in healthy Japanese adults shows that drinking 200 mL of a beverage containing beta-carotene 7.4-12.4 mg and Levilactobacillus brevis KB290 10 billion colony forming units daily for 12 weeks during influenza season does not reduce the risk of influenza or fever when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients under 40 years of age, the risk of influenza was reduced by around 53% when compared with placebo (107287). It is unclear if these findings are due to beta-carotene, Levilactobacillus brevis, or the combination.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for IBS.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults with minor diarrhea-predominant IBS-like symptoms shows that taking a combination of beta-carotene 4.0-4.5 mg and Levilactobacillus brevis daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces abdominal pain and stool frequency when compared with placebo. There were no differences between groups in improvements in stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, or other symptoms (110960). Although this study included adults with diarrhea-predominant IBS-like symptoms, patients with diagnosed IBS were excluded, limiting the generalizability of the study.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene might help prevent NAFLD.\nObservational research has found that higher intake and blood levels of beta-carotene are associated with 25% to 37% lower odds of NAFLD (101696).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. Evidence for the use of beta-carotene for oral leukoplakia is conflicting.\nSome clinical research in patients with tobacco and/or betel nut chewing habits shows that taking beta-carotene 360 mg daily for 12 months induces complete remission in 33% of patients with oral leukoplakia, compared with 10% of patients receiving placebo (34674). A small clinical study shows that taking beta-carotene (Solatene, Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc.) 30 mg twice daily for 6 months induces remission in 52% of patients with oral leukoplakia when compared with baseline (1472). However, a lower dose of beta-carotene in combination with vitamin C did not seem to be beneficial. A small clinical study in Japanese non-smoking adults with oral leukoplakia shows that taking beta-carotene 10 mg daily plus vitamin C 500 mg daily for 12 months does not improve clinical response or reduce the development of oral cancer over 5 years when compared with placebo (91384).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving oral mucositis after radiation therapy.\nA small clinical study shows that taking beta-carotene 250 mg daily for up to 21 days followed by 75 mg daily for the remainder of radiation therapy or chemotherapy does not prevent the development of oral mucositis when compared with placebo (34637).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for reducing osteoarthritis progression.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary intake of beta-carotene is not associated with a reduced risk of developing osteoarthritis. However, the highest intake of beta-carotene is associated with a reduced rate of knee osteoarthritis progression when compared with lowest intake (5881).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for reducing the risk of osteoporosis.\nAlthough observational studies in individuals 50 years of age and older has found that those with the highest dietary intake of beta-carotene had a 67% reduced odds of osteoporosis when compared with the lowest intake (107289), a meta-analysis of observational research shows that beta-carotene intake, based on dietary intake and serum levels, is not associated with risk of osteoporosis (109771). However, the highest intake of beta-carotene was associated with a 30% reduced risk of fractures in male, female, and Asian subgroups when compared with the lowest intake. Also, there was evidence of a small association between increased beta-carotene intake and increased overall bone density in Asian individuals, but not in individuals from studies published in the US, Europe, or Australia (109771).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention.\nObservational research has found that a diet rich in carotenoids, including beta-carotene and especially alpha-carotene, is associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal patients (10133).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of low quality research shows that taking beta-carotene supplements, alone or in combination with other antioxidants such as vitamin A or vitamin E, does not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with control (12185).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene prevents Parkinson disease development.\nObservational research has found that beta-carotene intake is not associated with Parkinson disease risk (91164).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving physical performance and muscle strength in older people.\nPopulation research has found that higher intake of dietary beta-carotene is associated with improved physical performance and muscle strength in elderly people (14006).\nless\nPolymorphous light eruption (PMLE). It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for improving PMLE.\nSome small clinical studies show that taking beta-carotene orally 25-250 mg daily improves sun exposure tolerance when compared with baseline in patients with PMLE (34455, 34652). However, one larger clinical study shows that beta-carotene 15-180 mg daily does not improve photosensitivity when compared with baseline (34673). The validity of the findings from each of these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral beta-carotene is beneficial for pre-eclampsia prevention.\nSome epidemiological research has found that the highest intake of beta-carotene during pregnancy is associated with 69% reduced odds of having pre-eclampsia when compared with the lowest intake (109762). The effects of beta-carotene supplementation are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate beta-carotene for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbsorption of beta-carotene is variable. The intestine has a limited capacity to absorb intact beta-carotene (8044). Beta-carotene appears to be absorbed better from supplements than food (34490). The amount of beta-carotene absorbed from food is only about 5% to 30% of that from synthetic supplements due to complexes it forms with proteins and fiber. Heating food may break down these complexes (2628). Beta-carotene requires some dietary fat for absorption, but supplemental beta-carotene is similarly absorbed when taken with high-fat (36 grams fat) or low-fat (3 grams fat) meals (2628, 6133). The amount of beta-carotene absorbed and converted to vitamin A also depends upon the individual's vitamin A status, beta-carotene body stores, and the amount of beta-carotene ingested (2628, 8044). Age does not appear to play a role in the ability to absorb and use beta-carotene (34509).\n\nThere is more than one isomer of beta-carotene and there may be differences in their absorption. The 9-cis-beta-carotene isomer is poorly absorbed, and most of it is converted to all-trans-beta-carotene in the intestine (2628).\n\nBeta-carotene supplements are available in both oil matrix gelatin capsules and water-miscible forms. Some clinical trials have used water-miscible beta-carotene (10%) beadlets. The water miscible form seems to produce a 47% to 50% higher plasma beta-carotene level than oil matrix gelatin capsules (10136).\nDistribution\nThe cis isomers of beta-carotene account for less than 5% of carotenoids in plasma, but 10% to 25% of carotenoids in the tissues are beta-carotene cis isomers (2628). Carotenoids are mainly carried in the blood on low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (2628).\nMetabolism\nSome ingested beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the intestinal mucosa (2628, 34660), while some is converted to vitamin A in the liver (34660). Although beta-carotene is partly metabolized to vitamin A, high intake of beta-carotene does not result in vitamin A toxicity because the proportion converted to vitamin A decreases as beta-carotene intake increases (8044). Age does not appear to play a role in the ability to convert beta-carotene to vitamin A (34509).\nExcretion\nBeta-carotene is excreted in the feces (91385). In a single male, the mean residence time for beta-carotene was 51 days (34660).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeta-carotene belongs to a class of red, orange, and yellow pigments called carotenoids. There are hundreds of varieties of provitamin A carotenoids, which are present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables (2628, 8044). Commercially available beta-carotene is produced synthetically or from palm oil, algae, or fungi (11786).\n\nBeta carotene is converted to retinal, which is essential for vision and is subsequently converted to retinoic acid, which is used for processes involving growth and cell differentiation (7135, 8044). The typical dietary intake of beta-carotene in American adults varies from 0.5 to 6.5 mg per day (2628). Beta-carotene is closely related to alpha-carotene; both are precursors for vitamin A (2628). Beta-carotene and other carotenoids provide approximately 50% of the vitamin A needed in the American diet (8044).\n\nBeta-carotene consists of a number of isomers. Synthetic beta-carotene, the form used in most of the clinical studies, is composed of the all-trans form. Natural beta-carotene sources contain 9-cis-, 13-cis-, and 15-cis-beta-carotene (1474). The 9-cis-beta-carotene isomer is poorly absorbed, and most of it is converted to all-trans-beta-carotene in the intestine (2628). The cis isomers account for less than 5% of carotenoids in plasma, but 10-25% of carotenoids in the tissues are beta-carotene cis isomers (2628). Little is known about the pharmacology of beta-carotene and the differences that may exist between the various isomers and the natural and synthetic forms (2628). Beta-carotene has activity independent of its conversion to vitamin A (139, 1470).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSerum beta-carotene levels seem to be inversely related to C-reactive protein levels and the white blood count. These markers are markers of inflammation and are associated with tumor recurrence and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (10135). In humans, beta-carotene decreases levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (34487).\nAntioxidant effects\nBeta-carotene seems to have antioxidant activities and prevent lipid peroxidation (139, 34487). It has been proposed that the antioxidant effects may help prevent cancer by reducing free radical-induced DNA damage (2592, 2599). However, beta-carotene does not have antioxidant effects in all human or laboratory studies, suggesting dose, specific outcome measures, and/or and health of the individual may play a role (34464, 34473).\nCancer effects\nThere seems to be an inverse relationship between dietary carotenoid intake, or serum beta-carotene levels, and the incidence of various cancers (1444, 34551, 34578, 34609, 34610, 34611, 34628, 34634). In vitro studies show that beta-carotene and palm oil carotene inhibit tumor cell growth (2592, 2628, 14045). There is preliminary evidence that carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can inhibit breast cancer cell growth regardless of estrogen receptor status (8045). However, dietary beta-carotene is not substantially concentrated in breast adipose tissue. Breast adipose tissue concentrations are only slightly higher than serum concentrations (10243).\n\nThere is also evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by certain statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with carotenoids (8046). However, anticancer effects of beta-carotene supplementation have not been effectively demonstrated in humans.\n\nDespite these potential positive effects, there is some concern that beta-carotene metabolites with pharmacological activity can accumulate and have carcinogenic effects (6377, 6393). Components of cigarette smoke can degrade beta-carotene, and lower concentrations of beta-carotene have been reported in both active and passive smokers (2592, 2593). Smoking might enhance production of carcinogenic beta-carotene oxidation metabolites which, if not neutralized by other antioxidants (such as tocopherol and ascorbate, which are also often depleted in smokers), could lead to increased risk of lung cancer (2628, 6377). In addition, beta-carotene metabolites might increase the binding of carcinogenic metabolites to DNA and inhibit gap-junction communication between normal cells and tumor cells. Beta-carotene itself might also increase the levels of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP450) dependent enzymes that can hydroxylate and activate certain compounds into their highly carcinogenic forms (6393), as well as increase catabolism of retinoic acid, which controls lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (2592).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is some evidence to suggest that dietary intake of beta-carotene from fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (34585). However, taking beta-carotene supplements does not appear to reduce CVD risk in general (1448, 2646) and may increase risk, at least in smokers (2642, 3937, 3949).\nDermatologic effects\nIn humans, beta-carotene reduces signs of aging of the skin. Mechanisms of action may involve increased production of collagen and reduced harmful ultraviolet-induced oxidative or other reactions in the skin (91381)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBeta-cryptoxanthin is more hydrophilic than other carotenoids, including beta-carotene and lycopene, and seems to be more bioavailable (109782). After intake of a single dose of beta-cryptoxanthin, levels dose-dependently peaked 6-24 hours later (109787, 109790) and remained elevated for up to 17 days (109787). When taken over 12 weeks, serum levels continue to increase over the supplementation period (109787, 109797). Beta-cryptoxanthin in plasma is free and unesterified (109790, 109797).\n\nThe absorption of a single dose of beta-cryptoxanthin is increased 1.8-fold when taken with food containing fat (109787). Also, when taken with breakfast, the absorption of beta-cryptoxanthin is 1.8-fold greater from a single dose of pasteurized orange juice when compared with fresh navel oranges (109795).\nDistribution\nAs measured by spectrophotometry, beta-cryptoxanthin levels increase in the palmar skin following intake for 12 weeks (109787). Beta-cryptoxanthin is found in both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood (109782), as well as in breast milk and the brain (109782). In an animal model, beta-cryptoxanthin is stored in the liver and adipose tissue (109782).\nMetabolism\nSome beta-cryptoxanthin is converted to the retinal form of vitamin A in the cells of the intestinal lining and/or the liver. Retinal can then be converted to retinol and retinyl esters (109782).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeta-cryptoxanthin is a carotenoid. In the diet, it is found in high levels in some types of squash, peppers, orange citrus fruit, and papaya (109797, 109805, 109807). In papaya, beta-cryptoxanthin is found only in an esterified form, along with caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid (109790).\nAnti-cancer effects\nBeta-cryptoxanthin is of interest for lung cancer and other cancers. In vitro and in animal research, beta-cryptoxanthin has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. There is some evidence that it stimulates the expression of anti-oncogenes (109782, 109805). Beta-cryptoxanthin may also stimulate the differentiation of lung cancer cells and reduce the growth of these cells. Beta-cryptoxanthin has also shown beneficial anti-cancer effects in other animal models, including bladder cancer and colon cancer (109782).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn an animal diabetic model, beta-cryptoxanthin attenuated increases in levels of glucose and triglycerides (109794).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, beta-cryptoxanthin is able to quench singlet oxygen (109782). However, levels of beta-cryptoxanthin are generally low in humans and any antioxidant effects may not be clinically relevant (109782).\nBone effects\nPopulation research has found that increased dietary intake of beta-cryptoxanthin is associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis (109783). Although the mechanism of action is unclear, animal research has found that beta-cryptoxanthin protects against bone loss. This may be related to the effect of beta-cryptoxanthin on the formation and activity of osteoblast and osteoclast cells in vitro (109782, 109794). However, human research has found that taking supplemental beta-cryptoxanthin for 4 weeks does not have beneficial effects on bone markers (109792).\nLiver protective effects\nBeta-cryptoxanthin has shown clinically beneficial effects in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (109785). This may be related to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of beta-cryptoxanthin. In an animal model of severe disease, beta-cryptoxanthin inhibited the hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation and the infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells, including macrophages. There was also evidence of reduced oxidative stress. These findings were associated with reduced liver fat and fibrosis (109793)."

Consuming products containing at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber, including beta-glucans, per day may reduce the risk of CHD when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\nClinical research shows that a diet containing foods high in beta-glucans, such as oats and barley, reduces the risk of heart disease (2737, 4960, 4962, 4963, 4964, 4965, 4966, 4967, 4968). In 1993, the FDA approved a health claim stating that consuming products containing at least 3 grams of beta-glucans per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD (102336). However, clinical studies show that at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber daily is needed to reduce the risk of CHD (5786, 5787, 5788, 5794, 5795, 5796).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Oral beta-glucans modestly reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.\nAlthough some research disagrees, most clinical research shows that taking barley- or oat-derived beta-glucans 3-10 grams daily for up to 12 weeks or yeast-derived beta-glucans 7.5 grams twice daily for 7-8 weeks can reduce LDL and total cholesterol levels when used for up to 12 weeks (5790, 5796, 7272, 17129, 34700, 34727, 34729, 34765, 34766, 34811)(34812, 34876). Meta-analyses of available clinical research on oat-derived beta-glucans show that taking at least 3 grams daily reduces LDL cholesterol by around 4-10 mg/dL and total cholesterol by 4-12 mg/dL but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels when compared with control diets (92660, 97987, 112225). Consuming oat-derived beta-glucans also reduces apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels by 0.54 mg/dL when compared with control diets (97987). The effects of oat-derived beta-glucans on cholesterol levels appear to be greater in patients with diabetes and those with higher LDL cholesterol levels (92660, 97987). A meta-analysis of available clinical research on barley-derived beta-glucans shows that consuming an average of 6.5-7 grams of beta-glucans daily as part of the diet reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 4.5 mg/dL, total cholesterol levels by 5.6 mg/dL, and apoB levels by 0.54 mg/dL when compared with control diets (98204).\n\nThe form of beta-glucans used may alter the effect of beta-glucans on cholesterol levels. Some research shows that barley that is highly enriched (75% by weight) with beta-glucans does not significantly affect cholesterol levels. This lack of effect seems to be the result of processing the barley into a highly enriched beta-glucans product (10166). Other clinical research also shows that the processing of beta-glucans products or the food matrix used to make these products might reduce beta-glucans molecular weight and/or solubility and therefore decrease its ability to lower cholesterol levels (10145, 34800, 34819).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging.

Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for patients with critical illness.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking oat-derived beta-glucans 3 grams daily as part of enteral feeds does not reduce the length of hospital stay, mortality rate, or infection rate when compared with placebo in patients with trauma. However, the length of time on mechanical ventilation was approximately 47% shorter when compared with placebo (100186).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies in children and adults with type 1 diabetes suggest that beta-glucans do not improve blood glucose levels. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes.\nSome preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming oat-derived beta-glucans 3 grams daily in bread for 3 weeks improves insulin resistance and cholesterol levels when compared with control bread (34765). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming bread containing oat-derived beta-glucans in a ratio of 7.6 grams per 100 grams of starch daily for 6 months reduces postprandial glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with control bread (97986). Additionally, some clinical research shows that replacing a half serving of white rice with beta-glucans-containing barley attenuates increases in postprandial glucose and insulin levels when compared with a full serving of white rice in patients with type 2 diabetes (103887). However, oat-derived beta-glucans 3-3.5 grams daily in bread or soup for 3-8 weeks does not seem to significantly affect fasting plasma glucose levels or HbA1c when compared with control bread or soup (34765, 34788). Also, some evidence shows that consuming soup enriched with beta-glucans does not improve cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with control soup (34788). The inconsistency in clinical outcomes may be due to differences in the length of treatment, quantity or ratio of beta-glucans consumed, and/or the preparation of the beta-glucans product.\n\nIn children with type 1 diabetes, consuming a bedtime snack enriched in beta-glucans appears to prevent hypoglycemia prior to midnight, but does not prevent hypoglycemia at later time points when compared with a control snack (34685). In adolescents with type 1 diabetes, a very small clinical study shows that taking a specific oat product (Betaglucare), providing 6 grams beta-glucans, in three divided doses daily for one week is beneficial for glycemic control and variability when compared with a standard diet without beta-glucans or with 3 grams beta-glucans daily. Maximal, mean, and pre- and post-meal blood glucose levels were modestly lower, and minimal blood glucose levels were modestly higher. Most measures of glycemic variability were statistically different, although there were no differences in the durations of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia between groups (105261). However, a small crossover study in adults with type 1 diabetes shows that taking a specific product (Stomacol, Brainbridge Commerce AB) containing beta-glucans 1.53 grams 3 times daily prior to meals for 2 weeks does not alter blood glucose levels when compared with placebo (97983).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. There is conflicting evidence about the effects of beta-glucans on respiratory infections in athletes following competitive events.\nTaking a specific product containing oat beta-glucans (OatVantage) 5.6 grams daily for 14 days does not reduce the number of sick days or the number of upper respiratory tract infections in trained male cyclists when compared with placebo (34746). However, other clinical research shows that taking yeast-derived beta-glucans 250-500 mg daily for 4 weeks beginning on the day after a marathon reduces the occurrence of symptomatic upper respiratory infections by 33% to 50% within 2-4 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. Health scores, fatigue, and mood also improved (34860, 92659). Additional clinical research in marathon runners shows that drinking a beverage containing yeast-derived beta-glucans 250 mg daily for 45 days prior to, the day of, and 45 days after a marathon does not reduce the duration or number of upper respiratory infections, but does seem to reduce the number of symptomatic days and overall severity of upper respiratory symptoms, when compared with placebo (103886). Finally, clinical research in top athletes also shows that taking a specific product containing mushroom-derived beta-glucans (Imunoglukan P4H, PLEURAN s.r.o.) 200 mg with vitamin C 200 mg daily for 3 months reduces the number of subjects with at least four symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection by approximately 85% when compared with vitamin C alone (34809).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nHepatitis. Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for hypertension; the available evidence is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming an oat cereal containing beta-glucans 5.52 grams daily for 6 weeks reduces diastolic and systolic blood pressure when compared with a low-fiber cereal in hypertensive adults (34691). However, other clinical research shows that consuming oat-based cereals enriched in beta-glucans for 12 weeks does not reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. A reduction in blood pressure occurred in a sub-group of these individuals with a body mass index greater than 31.5 kg/m2 (34684, 34722).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral beta-glucans have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with IBD and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome shows that taking a combination of beta-glucans, inositol, and digestive enzymes daily for 4 weeks, in conjunction with mesalamine, reduces evacuative urgency when compared with mesalamine alone. Taking this combination product also reduces abdominal pain, bloating, and gas when compared with baseline, but not when compared with taking mesalamine alone (97984).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral beta-glucans have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking one pill twice daily of a specific combination product (Biointol, BioActivaL) containing beta-glucans, inositol, and digestive enzymes for 4 weeks reduces pain, bloating, and gas, but not other symptoms of IBS, when compared with no treatment (34818). It is not clear if these effects are due to beta-glucans, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLaser skin resurfacing. It is unclear if topical beta-glucans are beneficial for improving recovery from laser skin resurfacing.\nIn patients that had received fractional laser therapy for atrophic acne scars, preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of skin care products containing beta-glucans, including dressings, solutions, and creams, (Dermdoc, Songyang Biotechnology Co. Ltd) once daily to one side of the face for 14 days modestly increases hydration and reduces redness when compared with the other side of the face treated with the vehicle alone (105263).\nless\nLower respiratory tract infections. Oral beta-glucans have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 2-6 years with recurrent respiratory tract infections shows that taking a specific combination product (Stimunex gocce) containing beta-glucans, elderberry extract, zinc, and vitamin D3 does not reduce the number or duration of lower respiratory tract infections when compared with no treatment. In the four months after treatment completion, the number of infections was reduced by about 50%; however, the total number of infections in each group was small. The dose was 1 drop/kg daily for one month, followed by 1 drop/kg daily for 15 consecutive days each month for the next three months (109212).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome or at high risk for metabolic syndrome shows that eating 200 grams of bread enriched with 6% barley-derived beta-glucans daily for 4 weeks as part of the diet does not alter most metabolic parameters when compared with baseline. However, there was a small reduction in total cholesterol (100185). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nNeuroblastoma. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans is beneficial in children or young adults with neuroblastoma.\nClinical research in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma shows that taking yeast-derived beta-glucans for 17 days, starting four days before treatment with intravenous anti-GD2 murine monoclonal antibody for a total of 10 days, results in progression-free and overall survival rates of 28% and 61%, respectively, after 2 years, and 19% and 36%, respectively, after 5 years. Doses of beta-glucans ranged from 10-200 mg/kg daily and each patient completed 1-4 treatment cycles (109203). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to a control group. A large clinical study in children and young adults with high-risk neuroblastoma receiving subcutaneous GD2/GD3 vaccine shows that taking beta-glucans 40 mg/kg/day for 14 days as a primer to the vaccine improves the IgG antibody response at 32 weeks when compared with controls who started taking beta-glucans 6 weeks after vaccination. However, taking beta-glucans prior to vaccination does not improve overall or progression-free survival at approximately 20 months (112227). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in survival between groups.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for obesity.\nA meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials shows that taking beta-glucans reduces body weight by about 0.8 kg and body mass index (BMI) by about 0.6 kg/m2 when compared with not taking beta-glucans. However, there was no effect on waist circumference. Also, populations included in this meta-analysis included those with obesity, as well as healthy individuals and patients with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia (100183). Results from individual clinical trials are mixed, with some showing modest reductions in body weight, BMI, and/or waist circumference, and others showing no effect (34790, 98202, 98203, 100183, 109208). This research has evaluated barley-, oat-, or yeast-derived beta-glucans at doses between 0.88-9 grams daily for 0.4-12 weeks (34790, 98202, 98203, 100183, 109208). Also, a capsule containing yeast-derived beta-glucans 477 mg has been taken daily for 2 weeks, then twice daily for 4 weeks (98203). Beta-glucans have also been taken in combination with other ingredients. For example, barley-derived beta-glucans 2.2 grams has been mixed with rice and consumed twice daily with meals for 12 weeks (98202) and oat-derived beta-glucans (B-Can, Garuda International, Inc.) 2.5 grams has been taken with green coffee polyphenols 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks (109208). The inconsistency in clinical outcomes may be due to the heterogenous patient populations, as well as the differing sources, doses, and dosage forms of beta-glucans used.\nless\nOtitis media. Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for otitis media, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for reducing abdominal pain after surgery for intestinal polyps.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients who underwent surgical removal of intestinal polyps shows that eating bread containing barley beta-glucans 3 grams daily for 3 months reduces bloating and abdominal pain when compared with eating bread that does not contain beta-glucans (34813).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Oral beta-glucans have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 2-6 years with recurrent respiratory tract infections shows that taking a specific combination product (Stimunex gocce) containing beta-glucans, elderberry extract, zinc, and vitamin D3 reduces the duration of respiratory tract infections by about 1.7 days and modestly improves parent-perceived symptom severity and effectiveness when compared with no treatment. However, there was no effect on the number of total, upper, or lower respiratory tract infections, the use of antibiotics or antipyretics, or the number of days missed from school. The product was dosed as 1 drop/kg daily for one month, followed by 1 drop/kg daily for 15 consecutive days each month for the next three months (109212).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there is interest in using oral beta-glucans for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for this condition.\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical beta-glucans are beneficial for stretch marks.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a specific topical serum and emulsion (Awake; Hangzhou Songyang Biotechnical) containing beta-glucans, applied twice daily for 12 weeks, modestly improves patient-scored, but not physician-scored, stretch mark appearance when compared with a vehicle control. When beta-glucans are used in combination with 1565-nm non-ablative fractional laser once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, scar atrophy is modestly improved when compared with either treatment alone (109210). However, it is unclear if any changes would be considered clinically significant.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral beta-glucans are beneficial for the prevention of URTIs in adults or children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking yeast-derived beta-glucans reduces the odds of developing a URTI in generally healthy individuals by approximately 65% when compared with placebo. There was also a small to medium effect on the overall incidence and duration of URTIs. Doses ranged from 35-900 mg daily for 4-26 weeks (105264). However, the results from this analysis were heterogeneous and the number of studies included was small. One study included in the analysis used a specific product containing yeast-derived beta-glucans (Wellmune WGP) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks and found no effect on the number or duration of overall symptomatic infections or the number or duration of specific types of respiratory infections when compared with placebo. However, there was an improvement in quality of life and a reduction in the number of missed work days (34879).\n\nBeta-glucans have also been evaluated for the prevention of URTI in children. A small clinical study in children aged 2-6 years with recurrent respiratory tract infections shows that taking a specific combination product (Stimunex gocce) containing beta-glucans, elderberry extract, zinc, and vitamin D3 does not reduce the number or duration of upper respiratory tract infections when compared with no treatment. At four months after treatment completion, the number of infections was reduced by about 44%; however, the total number of infections in both groups was small. The product was dosed as 1 drop/kg daily for one month, followed by 1 drop/kg daily for 15 consecutive days each month for the next three months (109212).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical beta-glucans for healing of wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and dermatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of beta-glucans for these purposes.\nMore evidence is needed to rate beta-glucans for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBarley- and oat-derived beta-glucans have most often been used in doses of 2-6 grams daily for 3-12 weeks.

The structure of beta-glucans can vary depending on the source and method of isolation. In general, beta-glucans isolated from cereal sources such as barley, oats, or wheat are linear, while beta-glucans isolated from yeast, fungi, and some bacteria are branched (92654).\n\nBeta-glucans investigated in clinical trials have been derived from yeast (7272, 34859, 34860, 34879, 105264), oats (34691, 34765, 100186, 105261), barley (5796, 17129, 34700, 34727, 34729, 34765, 34766, 34811, 34812, 34813)(34876, 100185), and mushrooms (34809, 105263).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation and treatment of overdose with beta-glucans.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSeveral beta-glucan supplement products claim that beta-glucans can only be absorbed after oral administration if the product is prepared by a patented process which micronizes beta-glucan particles to a size of 1 micron or less. However, there is no reliable evidence to support such a claim. Mammals lack the enzyme beta-1-2-glucanase which is required to digest and absorb beta-glucans when taken by mouth (3393).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, beta-glucans are resistant to digestion but may undergo fermentation by colon microflora (92655). Levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, are increased in feces after oral intake of beta-glucans (100185).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeta-glucans are polysaccharides that consist of (1-3)- and (1-4)-beta-D-linked polymers of glucose that are either non-branched or with 1-6-beta-branches (3394, 7242, 109203). Beta-glucans are primary components in cell walls of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae, lichens, and plants such as oats and barley (3394, 7242, 7250, 34756). The beta-glucans most extensively studied to date are yeast-derived beta-glucans and oat-derived beta-glucans (7273, 34738, 34842).\nAnticancer effects\nBeta-glucans are of interest for their anticancer effects. Laboratory and clinical research has generally focused on purified forms of beta-glucans for parenteral use, as opposed to beta-glucans found in foods. In this regard, beta-glucans do not seem to have direct antitumor or antibacterial activity but are thought to act as biological response modifiers (BRMs) that restore or enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (3394, 7237, 7238, 7239, 7240, 7251, 34849). However, some animal research suggests that orally administered barley, fungi, or yeast beta-glucan enhances tumoricidal activity of macrophages (34709, 34760, 34771, 34774, 105272).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that beta-glucans have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic activity (34696, 34735, 34799).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nBeta-glucans are thought to lower cholesterol by forming a layer adjacent to the intestinal mucosa that delays or prevents cholesterol absorption (7273, 10166). Beta-glucans might also bind bile acids in the intestinal lumen (7272, 10166, 34726, 34775, 34817). Some preliminary evidence also suggests that beta-glucans may reduce hepatic cholesterol synthesis and promote hepatic production of bile acids (34775). The degree of cholesterol lowering appears to be affected by the molecular weight, water solubility, and degree of processing of the beta-glucans present in the product. Food processing of beta-glucans can eliminate the cholesterol-lowering effects of beta-glucans (17129).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSupplementing certain foods such as muesli with beta-glucans may increase the rate of gastric emptying, while supplementing other foods such as bread with beta-glucans may decrease the rate of gastric emptying (33750, 34751). The viscosity of food has been purported as a factor influencing the effect of beta-glucans on the rate of gastric emptying, as demonstrated by a greater increase in emptying rate with low- vs. high-viscosity foods supplemented with beta-glucans (34761).\n\nOat beta-glucans are also of interest for gastritis. Clinical research in patients with gastritis shows that taking beta-glucans for 30 days reduces mucosal infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils. The mechanism of action is unclear. However, intake of beta-glucans was also associated with decreased blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), improved antioxidant status, and increased fecal short-chain fatty acids (109202).\nGlucose-regulatory effects\nClinical evidence suggests that beta-glucans slow glucose absorption following a meal (34708, 34749, 105262). For each 1 gram of medium-to-high molecular weight oat beta-glucans per 30 grams of carbohydrates, there was an 8% to 9% reduction in glucose levels (105262). Oat beta-glucans also seem to reduce post-meal levels of insulin, with a 10% to 11% reduction per 1 gram oat beta-glucans for each 30 grams carbohydrate (105262). Some research has shown that beta-glucans possibly promote longer-lasting insulin secretion (34708, 34749). These effects of beta-glucans appear to be influenced by its viscosity, molecular weight, and solubility (34708, 34761, 34784, 34858, 34863). Beta-glucans derived from oyster mushroom do not seem to reduce postprandial insulin or glucose levels (109209). Also, beta-glucans do not affect serum levels of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP); however, effects on glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 are mixed (33750, 109209).\nImmunological effects\nBeta-glucans are of interest for their immunologic effects. Clinical evidence suggests that yeast-derived beta-glucans increase mucosal immunity in athletes based on increased levels of salivary IgA two-hours post-exercise (92659). Other clinical evidence shows that oyster mushroom-derived beta-glucans stabilize IgE levels in children 6-10 years of age who have atopy and recurrent respiratory infections (92657). Most evidence from various other clinical trials suggests that beta-glucans do not increase the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, white blood cell counts, or NK cell activity (34724, 34746, 34752, 34807, 34827, 92658). However, in one clinical trial, taking a yeast-derived beta-glucans supplement daily for 6 weeks modestly reduced IL-6 levels and increased IL-10 levels in overweight adults (98203). In another clinical trial, taking oat-derived beta-glucans modestly increased IL-12 levels, but did not affect C-reactive protein (100186). The mechanism of action related to oral intake of beta-glucans is not clear. Most research is in vitro or in animal models. In this regard, beta-glucans have been shown to restore or enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses promoting recovery from immunosuppression. Beta-glucans specifically bind to monocyte and macrophage cell lines, increase the proliferation and activation of macrophages, and increase the production of IL-1 by macrophages, which promotes the release of IL-2 by T-cells (7238, 7239, 7240, 7243, 7250, 7251, 34773, 105272). However, clinical research in older adults shows that taking yeast-, shiitake mushroom-, or oat-based beta glucans for 5 weeks, starting two weeks before influenza immunization, does not increase the immune response to the vaccine (109206).\n\nTopical beta-glucans have also been investigated. In patients with burns, application of yeast-derived beta-glucans has been shown to increase levels of IL-4, but not IL-17 or IFN-gamma (109211).\nWeight loss effects\nSome research suggests that beta-glucans can have beneficial effects on hormones and other gastrointestinal peptides involved in appetite regulation, potentially leading to long-term weight loss effects. For example, some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that beta-glucans can increase levels of the anorexigenic hormone peptide Y-Y (PYY) and decrease levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin (34761, 34789). In one study in young females with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, consuming a single dose of oat-derived beta-glucans increased satiety and reduced appetite; modest weight loss occurred after 5 weeks of use (107935). Other research shows that hunger is reduced in overweight or obese individuals when beta-glucans are taken alone or with green coffee extract. However, food intake may not be reduced (109205, 109209). Conflicting findings exist. In one study, consuming a meal with oat-derived beta-glucans did not improve satiety or reduce caloric intake in a subsequent meal (92656). Other preliminary clinical evidence suggests that beta-glucans do not significantly affect most measures of ghrelin, leptin, PYY, or other gastrointestinal peptides that influence appetite (34790, 34796, 109205).\nWound-healing effects\nThere is some evidence that beta-glucans can decrease inflammation and accelerate the repair of surgical wounds by stimulating macrophages and increasing macrophage infiltration, causing increased tissue granulation and enhanced re-epithelialization of tissue (7246). In laboratory research, accelerated wound closure was thought to be related to the increased migration of dermal fibroblasts as shown in vitro (100184)."

After ruling out the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis, the patient was diagnosed with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis induced by starvation ketoacidosis.

The effects of higher doses or continued administration of BHB on athletic performance are unclear.\n\nAn ester precursor to BHB, 3-hydroxybutyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, has also been assessed. A small clinical study in trained cyclists shows that taking a single pre-exercise dose of this precursor increases 30-minute time trial performance distance by an additional 411 meters over taking carbohydrates alone (96099).\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if eye drops with BHB are beneficial for dry eye disorders.\nA small clinical study in patients with dry eye disorders shows that instilling eye drops containing 1% BHB six times daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo. In a sub-group of patients with insufficient tear formation, eye dryness was modestly improved; however, the capacity for tear secretion was not improved (96083).\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there is interest in using oral BHB for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of BHB for this condition.\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral BHB is beneficial in patients with episodic migraines.\nA small, clinical crossover study in adults with episodic migraines (5 to 14 monthly migraine days) shows that taking calcium magnesium BHB 18 grams daily for 12 weeks does not reduce migraine severity, the number of migraine days, or the number of days a migraine medication is consumed, when compared with placebo during the last month of treatment (107990). The validity of these findings is limited due to short duration of treatment; additionally, it is possible that the dose in this study was too low to produce an effect.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral BHB is beneficial for weight loss.\nA small clinical study in obese patients shows that taking BHB 18 grams daily attenuates loss of protein and lean mass and reduces feelings of hunger when compared to baseline. It was used intravenously for 3 days in patients on a very low-calorie diet and orally for 14 days in patients on a therapeutic starvation diet (96098). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there is interest in using oral BHB for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of BHB for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate beta-hydroxybutyrate for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBHB has been given orally and intravenously, usually as a sodium or calcium salt in a racemic mixture (96082, 96084, 96085, 96098). In order to avoid the use of BHB salts, synthetic ketone ester precursors, such as 3-hydroxybutyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, have also been used as a source of BHB (96099). BHB has also been applied topically in the eyes as 1% drops of d-BHB (96083).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with BHB.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\n3-hydroxybutyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, a precursor for BHB, is fully hydrolyzed in the intestine to BHB and 1,3-butanediol, which is also metabolized in the liver to BHB and acetoacetate (96102). Taking this ketone ester rapidly increases blood levels of BHB within 10 minutes, with increases of approximately 8-fold within 30 minutes, and maximal blood levels occurring within 1-3 hours (96086, 96087, 96088, 96093, 96099, 96102). In infants, sodium BHB given orally increases blood levels of BHB (96084, 96090). In adults, taking a mix of sodium and calcium BHB by mouth results in peak blood levels within one hour (96096).\nDistribution\nIn infants, BHB is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (96082, 96105, 96106). Administering sodium BHB orally to infants increases cerebrospinal fluid and intracerebral levels of BHB (96090).\nMetabolism\nBHB is used for energy by various organs in the body, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (96082). In the brain, the d-isomer of BHB is oxidized in the mitochondria by BHB dehydrogenase to produce acetoacetate and NADH (96106). BHB is also metabolized to acetyl-CoA, entering the Krebs cycle (96083).\nExcretion\n3-hydroxybutyl-3-hydroxybutyrate is used as a source of BHB. The elimination half-life of BHB following a single dose of 3-hydroxybutyl-3-hydroxybutyrate is 0.8-3.1 hours (96088).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nKetone bodies are produced in the liver from fatty acids when carbohydrate intake is low in order to provide energy and caution the body to conserve carbohydrates. BHB is produced in higher amounts than the other ketone bodies, acetone and acetoacetic acid (96083, 96086). Ketone bodies are normally found in very low levels in the blood. A level of more than 2 mM is considered to indicate hyperketonemia (96093, 96094).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn laboratory research, ketones like BHB have demonstrated anti-cancer effects. BHB is a class I and IIa histone deacetylase inhibitor, involved in the regulation of gene expression. In vitro, BHB reduces the proliferation of various cancer cell lines and increases their sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. This might provide an explanation for some preliminary clinical research showing anti-cancer effects associated with the ketogenic diet, a diet that increases levels of ketone bodies in the blood (96092).\nAnti-seizure effects\nIncreased blood levels of BHB appear to play a role in the anti-seizure benefits associated with the ketogenic diet, a diet that increases levels of ketone bodies in the blood. BHB seems to impact the function of neurons. According to laboratory research, BHB might alter levels of, or responsiveness to, gamma-aminobutyric acid in specific parts of the brain. Furthermore, BHB might alter the activity of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) that function in pre-synaptic vesicles of neurons. Some research suggests that BHB has a direct effect on the neuronal membrane potential via the potassium-ATP or calcium channels. Other research also suggests that BHB might improve the Krebs cycle function, optimizing energy in the neurons. These preliminary findings need to be substantiated in clinical research (96095, 96974, 96105, 96106).\nCognitive effects\nIn patients with Alzheimer disease or cognitive impairment, elevating blood levels of BHB with oral medium chain triglycerides seems to improve cognitive function (96089). In laboratory research, BHB seems to protect neurons against beta-amyloid toxicity, as well as to preserve integrity and stability of the neurons during periods of decreased exposure to glucose (96089, 96094). BHB seems to inhibit a specific type of inflammatory process initiated by beta-amyloid, thereby slowing cognitive decline (96105, 96106). Although the metabolism of glucose is altered in the brain of people with Alzheimer disease, some research suggests that metabolism of ketone bodies, like hydroxybutyrate, is not diminished. Having BHB available as a source of fuel might slow down cognitive decline (96094). BHB is a class I and IIa histone deacetylase inhibitor. In laboratory research, recovery of cognitive performance is associated with restoration of histone acetylation (96094).\nEndocrine effects\nHuman research suggests that consumption of a specific product (DeltaG; TDeltaS Global, Inc) containing the synthetic ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate might improve blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity by reducing the amount of L-alanine available for gluconeogenesis and inhibiting adipose tissue lipolysis, respectively (107991, 107993). Additional clinical research suggests that taking this drink before meals might improve 2-hour postprandial glucose levels in adults with prediabetes (108068).\nErgogenic effects\nBHB is of interest for improving exercise performance. It is used as a fuel source by the body during exercise, altering the use of glucose and the breakdown of fat and muscle tissue. The ability to use BHB as fuel is improved in trained muscle. Also, BHB is involved in the regulation of the adaptive response to exercise in skeletal muscle. This mechanism is possibly associated with the role of BHB in the inhibition of histone deacetylases (96093).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn animal and human research, BHB decreases levels of cholesterol, possibly by reducing cholesterol synthesis and increasing production of receptors for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (96087).\nMetabolic effects\nDuring times of fasting or reduced caloric intake, such as during weight loss or trauma, the body mobilizes fuel from fat stores and increases the endogenous production of glucose from protein. Infusion with BHB protects against the breakdown of fat, the endogenous production of glucose (96100), and possibly the breakdown of protein, although results are not consistent (96103, 96108, 102023).\n\nThere is interest in using BHB supplements to induce ketosis. However, research on this use is limited. In adolescents aged 10 to 17 years old, taking BHB salts 3.75 grams induces a state of mild ketosis within 15 minutes of consumption and maintains this state for approximately 30-60 minutes (107981).\n\nBHB has been considered for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Some case reports in infants with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) shows that taking sodium BHB 430-900 mg/kg daily in divided doses every 4 hours improves motor function, mood, behavior, speech, and cognition (96082, 96084). However, another case report found that an infant girl with MADD did not benefit until doses were increased to 2600 mg/kg (96085). One case report has also described the use of BHB in a child with Glycogen storage disease type III (Cori disease). When initiated in a 2-month-old child, BHB 400 mg/kg daily divided into feedings every 3 hours improved symptoms of cardiomyopathy over 2 years, with no apparent adverse effects on growth or liver size (96097). Prospective clinical research is needed to confirm these findings.\nMuscle glycogen effects\nIn human research, taking BHB orally with glucose seems to increase the formation of muscle glycogen following glycogen depletion. This is possibly related to the increased insulin production that occurs under conditions of high levels of glucose (96086).\nOcular effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of BHB helps with symptoms of dry eyes. According to animal research, this might be due to preservation of the ocular surface by preventing cellular degeneration, as opposed to increasing tear production (96083)."

            "Overview": "Betaine anhydrous is a chemical that occurs naturally in the body. It is produced by oxidation of choline in the liver and kidneys (16453). Betaine anhydrous is also found in foods such as beets, spinach, whole grains, liver, eggs, and seafood (16453, 34895).",

Some studies have reported a 3% to 4% increase in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with betaine anhydrous 6 grams daily (16452, 16455, 16456, 34904). A meta-analysis of 6 studies in adults, some with obesity and/or prediabetes, shows that taking betaine anhydrous 4-6 grams daily for 6-24 weeks is associated with a mean increase in total cholesterol of 4 mg/dL, with no significant change in LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels (105814). Another meta-analysis of 12 studies, some in healthy adults and others in adults with various disease states, shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1.5-20 grams daily for 2-52 weeks is associated with a mean increase in total cholesterol of 14 mg/dL, and a mean increase in LDL cholesterol of 10 mg/dL, with no change in triglyceride or HDL cholesterol levels (105813).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, betaine anhydrous can cause vomiting, nausea, GI distress, and diarrhea (698, 10631, 34888, 34928, 111374).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nWhen used orally to treat homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, elevated plasma methionine concentrations can occur following use of betaine anhydrous, which might lead to cerebral edema (698, 111374).\nless\nOther\nOrally, betaine anhydrous can cause body odor (698, 10631).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nHomocystinuria. Oral betaine anhydrous is effective at reducing plasma homocysteine levels in patients with homocystinuria associated with cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, or cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl) defect.\nClinical research shows that taking oral betaine anhydrous reduces plasma homocysteine levels by 20% to 30% when compared with placebo in adults and children with several types of homocystinuria, including CBS deficiency, MTHFR deficiency, and cbl defect (698). Observational studies have also found that betaine anhydrous reduces plasma homocysteine levels as monotherapy, in combination with other treatments, such as pyridoxine, folate, and cobalamin, and in patients refractory to pyridoxine treatment (145, 698, 34956).\n\nA specific betaine anhydrous product (Cystadane, Recordati Rare Diseases Inc.) is approved by the US FDA for homocystinuria. Oral betaine anhydrous is initiated at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily in children under 3 years of age and a dose of 3 grams twice daily in children 3 years and older, then titrated to effect. Although some patients have taken up to 20 grams daily, some clinical research suggests that doses above 150 mg/kg daily do not provide additional benefit (698).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Oral betaine anhydrous decreases plasma homocysteine levels in people with hyperhomocysteinemia; however, any effects on cardiovascular sequela and other clinical outcomes are unclear.\nMost clinical research in adults with normal or mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels (<25 micromol/L) shows that taking betaine anhydrous 3-6 grams daily orally for up to 12 weeks can modestly decrease plasma homocysteine levels by 5.5% to 15% when compared with control (6810, 16451, 16452, 34894, 34896, 34902, 34904, 34925, 34936). Some research indicates that oral doses of betaine anhydrous up to 4 grams daily can lower plasma homocysteine levels without an adverse effect on lipid levels (105813). However, it is not clear whether any reduction in plasma levels of homocysteine results in a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with kidney failure, clinical research shows that taking betaine anhydrous 4 grams daily lowers levels of plasma homocysteine after methionine loading, but does not affect fasting levels, when compared with control (16455). However, taking this dose of betaine anhydrous in combination with folate 5 mg daily does not seem to have additive homocysteine-lowering effects in patients with kidney failure when compared with folate alone (34885, 34957, 34963).\n\nA very small clinical study in children with hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to pyridoxine non-responsive cystathionine beta-synthase (pnrCBS) or cobalamin C (cblC) deficiencies shows that taking betaine anhydrous 100 or 250 mg/kg daily in divided doses for one month leads to similar reductions in total plasma homocysteine concentrations, suggesting that an increased dose is not beneficial in the setting of pediatric pnrCBS and cblC deficiencies. The researchers noted that increased doses of betaine anhydrous cause proportional increases in methionine concentrations, which can induce severe hypermethioninemia in patients with pnrCBS, possibly leading to increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. In contrast, increases in methionine and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations are desirable in patients with cblC deficiency since low concentrations of both are implicated in the pathology of cblC deficiency (111374).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAngelman syndrome. Oral betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with Angelman syndrome shows that taking betaine anhydrous (Cystadane, Recordati Rare Diseases, Inc.) 100-200 mg/kg daily or betaine anhydrous 6-12 grams daily for 12 months, in combination with folate, folic acid derivatives, creatine, and/or vitamin B12, does not prevent seizures or improve cognitive, motor, or language development, when compared with placebo or baseline (34932, 34945).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral betaine anhydrous improves athletic performance; small clinical trials have yielded conflicting findings that may be related to age, training status, and biological sex.\nSmall clinical trials in males with and without strength training experience shows that taking betaine anhydrous 2-2.5 grams daily for 10-15 days, either alone or in combination with resistance training or blood flow restriction, does not improve muscle power, strength, or performance on bench press, leg press, or squat exercises when compared with placebo (34940, 34941, 34947, 34954, 111373). In aerobic exercise training, a small clinical study in healthy untrained males shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1.25 grams twice daily with 300 mL of a sports beverage for 2 weeks does not improve aerobic capacity or performance during exhaustive endurance exercise when compared with placebo (105550). Similarly, a small clinical study in trained male runners shows that taking betaine anhydrous 5 grams once with 1000 mL of a sports beverage after becoming dehydrated does not improve long-distance running or sprinting after rehydration when compared with placebo (34916). Additional clinical research in males and females who have undergone at least 6 months of CrossFit training shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1.25 grams twice daily for 6 weeks while continuing to train does not improve muscle strength, body composition, aerobic capacity, or anaerobic performance when compared with placebo (105549).\n\nHowever, other research shows that betaine anhydrous benefits certain aspects of athletic performance in particular subgroups. One small clinical study in healthy, active males shows that taking betaine anhydrous 2.5 grams daily for 2 weeks improves subjective fatigue scores during exercise when compared with placebo (34941). Another small clinical study in active but untrained young females shows that taking betaine anhydrous (BetaPower, Finnfeeds) 2.5 grams daily for 8 weeks in combination with a structured resistance training program reduces body fat percentage and body fat mass, but does not improve muscle strength, when compared with placebo (98525). Another small clinical study in active females shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1.2 grams twice daily for 2 weeks improves power output during sprinting, but not oxygen uptake, when compared with placebo (107950).\n\nBetaine anhydrous has also been studied in adolescents. Preliminary clinical research in trained adolescent soccer players shows that taking betaine 1 gram twice daily orally with 300 mL water for 14 weeks improves muscle power, agility, and sprint time, but not muscle strength, when compared with placebo (108654).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral betaine anhydrous reduces the risk of colorectal adenoma.\nPreliminary population research has found that high dietary betaine intake is not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal adenoma when compared with low dietary betaine intake (14845).\nless\nDepression. Oral betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with major depression shows that taking a specific combination product (DDM Metile, Omeopiacenza) containing betaine anhydrous 125 mg and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) 250 mg orally twice daily for 12 months improves depression symptoms when compared with amitriptyline 75 mg daily. After 12 months, patients treated with the combination product showed an average improvement in depression scores of 38%, compared with 18% in patients treated with amitriptyline (90107). It is unclear if this effect is due to betaine anhydrous, SAMe, or the combination.\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if topical betaine anhydrous is beneficial in patients with dry mouth.\nApplying betaine anhydrous 4% topically twice daily in a toothpaste for 2 weeks reduces symptoms of dry mouth when compared with baseline (6812). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with dry mouth shows that using a specific mouthwash product (Xeros Dentaid) that contains betaine anhydrous 1.33%, xylitol 3.3%, and sodium fluoride 0.05%, each evening for 4 weeks improves dry mouth symptoms when compared with baseline (34944). It is unclear if this effect is due to betaine anhydrous, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the findings from these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nFibrocystic breast disease. Although there has been interest in using oral betaine anhydrous for fibrocystic breast disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of betaine anhydrous for this purpose.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of betaine anhydrous 100 mg, melatonin 6 mg, L-tryptophan 200 mg, vitamin B6 25 mg, folic acid 10 mg, vitamin B12 50 mcg, and methionine 100 mg daily for 40 days reduces symptoms of GERD in more patients when compared with omeprazole 20 mg daily. Symptom improvement occurred in 100% of patients who took this combination supplement, compared with only 66% of patients taking omeprazole (16011). It is unclear if this effect is due to betaine anhydrous, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGingivitis. Topical betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study of patients with gingivitis shows that brushing with a toothpaste containing a combination of extra virgin olive oil, xylitol, and betaine anhydrous daily for 4 months decreases gingival bleeding and improves markers associated with gingival health when compared with placebo and commercial toothpaste (111372).\nless\nHepatitis C. Oral betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin in combination with betaine anhydrous (Cystadane, Recordati Rare Diseases, Inc.) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) daily for 12 months induces early virological response in approximately 60% of patients with hepatitis C who were previously unresponsive to treatment with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. However, sustained virological response only occurred in 10% of these patients (20465). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if this effect is due to betaine anhydrous, SAMe, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral betaine anhydrous is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA large observational study in older adults with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome has found that increased dietary intake of betaine for 1 year is associated with reduced body weight, waist circumference, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and triglycerides and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (111375).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral betaine anhydrous is beneficial in patients with NASH.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking betaine anhydrous 10 grams twice daily orally for 12 months improves NASH scores when compared with placebo (34928). Taking betaine anhydrous also normalizes liver enzyme levels and reduces inflammation and fibrosis when compared with baseline (10631, 34928).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral betaine anhydrous is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nPreliminary clinic research in obese adults on a reduced-calorie diet shows that taking betaine anhydrous 3 grams orally twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or fat mass or improve resting energy expenditure when compared with placebo (16452). A meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of betaine anhydrous on body composition also shows that taking betaine 1.5-20 grams daily for 2-52 weeks does not reduce body mass, fat mass, or fat-free mass when compared with control. However, the validity of this study is limited by inclusion of obese, non-obese, and healthy patients (108653).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral betaine anhydrous for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of betaine anhydrous for this purpose.\nRett syndrome. Oral betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in female children with Rett syndrome shows that taking a combination of folate 15 mg and betaine anhydrous 6-12 grams orally daily for 12 months does not improve motor function, growth, or development when compared with placebo. In addition, one subgroup analysis suggests that taking the combination product may reduce head circumference growth rate (34922).\nless\nSunburn. Topical betaine anhydrous has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that applying a specific cream (Physiogel AI), which contains betaine anhydrous 0.36%, N-palmitoylethanolamine 0.3%, N-acetylethanolamine 0.21%, and sarcosine 0.24%, daily for one month prior to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure can reduce UV-induced redness when compared with placebo. However, application of this cream only once 20 minutes prior to UV exposure does not have any effect (34905). It is unclear if any benefits are due to betaine anhydrous, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate betaine anhydrous for these uses.",

Maximum concentrations are reached in plasma in approximately one hour (16450, 34902, 34916). Supplementation with betaine anhydrous 6 grams daily can increase plasma betaine levels 10-fold over 12 weeks (16452).\nDistribution\nBetaine anhydrous is extensively distributed to tissues, including the kidneys and liver (16450). When consumed orally, 50% of betaine anhydrous is distributed within approximately 0.5-1.75 hours, depending on dosing schedule (16450).\nMetabolism\nBetaine anhydrous is used in the methionine/homocysteine cycle, where it acts as a methyl donor (16449). One route of homocysteine metabolism is by methylation to form methionine, using a methyl group from methylcobalamin or from betaine anhydrous. Methionine is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine (698, 6810, 16449). Dimethylglycine is the by-product of betaine metabolism in the homocysteine re-methylation pathway, and concentrations of dimethylglycine increase in healthy subjects after betaine supplementation (16450).\nExcretion\nThe mean elimination half-life of betaine anhydrous is 14 hours after a single dose, and 41 hours after dosing for 5 days (16450). Time to elimination ranges from 13-26 hours for doses between 1-6 grams, and does not increase with increasing doses of betaine (34902). Only 4% of ingested betaine anhydrous is excreted as betaine anhydrous in urine; the main elimination route is through metabolism to dimethylglycine (16450).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBetaine anhydrous occurs naturally in the body. It is produced by oxidation of choline in the liver and kidneys. It is a methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine (16453). Betaine anhydrous is found in foods such as beets, spinach, whole grains, liver, eggs, and seafood (16453, 34895). Levels in plant food sources depend on growing conditions. For example, spinach grown in saline soil accumulates betaine anhydrous. Levels are reduced by cooking, especially boiling (16453). Dietary intake is estimated to be between 100 mg to 1 gram daily, and up to 2.5 grams daily with diets rich in whole wheat and seafood (16453, 34925, 98525).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary clinical research in trained adolescent soccer players shows that taking betaine 1 gram twice daily orally with 300 mL water for 14 weeks reduces serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha when compared with placebo (107949).\nAnticancer effects\nThe risk of colorectal adenoma has been linked to low dietary intake of nutrients such as folate and methionine, which are involved in methylation pathways. Therefore, it has been suggested that betaine might reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma. However, this has not been shown in humans (14845).\nAthletic performance effects\nBetaine can act as a methyl donor in the formation of creatine in the body, leading to the suggestion that it may improve athletic performance, and increase exercise tolerance and cardiac function in people with heart failure (16453). Betaine anhydrous might also enhance muscle oxygen consumption or extraction (34947).\n\nHowever, research in healthy males shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1.25 grams daily for 2 weeks does not increase peak oxygen consumption, heart rate, oxidative stress, or aerobic capacity, although it does reduce lymphocyte apoptosis, after exhaustive endurance exercise (105550).\nHomocysteine lowering effects\nBetaine anhydrous is used in the methionine/homocysteine cycle, where it acts as a methyl donor (16449). One route of homocysteine metabolism is by methylation to form methionine, using a methyl group from methylcobalamin or from betaine anhydrous. Methionine is then converted to S-adenosylmethione (SAMe) (698, 6810, 16449). In people with homocystinuria due to various inborn errors of metabolism, total plasma homocysteine concentrations are very high, >50 micromol/L, compared to normal levels of 5 to 15 micromol/L (3047, 6810). These elevated homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities and optic lens dislocation (698). When taken orally, betaine anhydrous can significantly reduce these elevated homocysteine levels. A reduction in plasma homocysteine is seen within a week, and steady state is reached within a month (698).\n\nIt has been suggested that the betaine content of wine may contribute to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in countries with a high wine consumption such as France, but it is not known whether the levels present, approximately 3 mg per glass, have any significant effect (6811).\n\nFollowing bariatric surgery, plasma levels of homocysteine increase in obese patients. It has been suggested that this is associated with a decrease in plasma levels of betaine following surgery. Therefore, betaine anhydrous supplementation might prevent the increase in homocysteine levels in these patients. However, this has not yet been shown in clinical research (95164).\nHormonal effects\nResearch in adolescent male soccer players shows that taking betaine anhydrous 1 gram twice daily, 2 hours prior to training and 1 hour post training, throughout a 14-week season, increases testosterone levels at the middle and the end of the season when compared with baseline. A decline in levels at the end of the season is seen in those taking placebo, suggesting that betaine anhydrous may attenuate reductions in testosterone seen with intense training during puberty (105812).\nLiver effects\nThe role of betaine anhydrous as a methyl donor in the formation of methionine and S-adenosyl-methionine may be important for fat metabolism in the liver. S-adenosyl-methionine is involved in the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine, which enhances secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) to transport fat out of the liver (10631, 16453). Betaine anhydrous can therefore act as a lipotrope, preventing or reducing accumulation of fat in the liver, such as occurs in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other forms of fatty liver disease (10631, 16449, 16453). S-adenosyl-methionine synthesis is reduced by chronic ethanol intake, due to inhibition of methionine synthase (6813, 16454). Preliminary evidence from animal studies suggests that betaine anhydrous might prevent and reverse ethanol-induced steatohepatitis (6813, 16454). Methotrexate also reduces S-adenosyl-methionine synthesis. It prevents conversion of dihydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate which is used in the formation of methylcobalamin, and hence in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine and S-adenosyl-methionine. Because betaine anhydrous provides an alternative pathway for methylation of homocysteine and increases S-adenosyl-methionine synthesis, it might prevent methotrexate-induced hepatic steatosis (16454). Similarly, it is hypothesized that betaine anhydrous might reduce fatty liver damage associated with high doses of niacin. Metabolism of niacin involves methylation by S-adenosyl-methionine; hence high doses may deplete S-adenosyl-methionine levels, decrease phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and cause fatty liver changes (16454).\nMouth moisturizing effects\nVarious products containing betaine have been shown to improve the feeling of dry mouth. Clinical research suggests that mouthwash containing betaine and other products improves saliva flow in the mouth (34910, 34944).\nMuscle effects\nBetaine supplies methyl groups for the formation of methionine from homocysteine. Methionine is involved in the synthesis of creatine and carnitine, and contributes to muscle growth and strength (105549). It is suggested that dietary betaine anhydrous intake may be linked to skeletal muscle mass. Research in middle-aged adults shows that those in the highest tertile of betaine intake have less loss of skeletal muscle mass in the limbs during 3 years of follow-up, and less reduction in appendicular skeletal mass index than those in the lowest tertile. They also may have an increase in skeletal muscle mass in the legs. However, the baseline dietary intake level of betaine in this study did not correlate with the baseline skeletal muscle mass (105815).\nOsmolytic effects\nIn the body, betaine anhydrous is an osmolyte, which maintains normal cell volume and protects intracellular enzymes under conditions of osmotic stress, without interfering with cellular function (16450, 16453). By this mechanism it protects kidney cells from high concentrations of electrolytes and urea (16453).\nWeight loss effects\nReports that betaine anhydrous improves liver fat metabolism and reduces adipose tissue in animals led to suggestions that it might decrease fat mass in humans, but this has not been confirmed (16449, 16452, 34890, 34938)."

Oral beta-sitosterol, in combination with a cholesterol-lowering diet, seems to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Beta-sitosterol 2.5-21.1 grams taken in up to three divided doses daily for 1-3 months has been used in adults. Beta-sitosterol 2-4 grams three times daily for 3 months has been used in children and adolescents (3889, 5331, 5332, 5333, 35067). Some research suggests that the optimal dose of beta-sitosterol is 6 grams daily; higher doses do not appear to be more effective (5333). However, some research in pediatric patients shows that beta-sitosterol can also decrease levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (5332) and that beta-sitosterol appears to be less effective for reducing LDL cholesterol when compared to sitostanol (3889). Furthermore, beta-sitosterol does not appear to improve triglyceride levels (5333).\n\nSome research has compared beta-sitosterol to cholesterol-lowering medication. In children with familial hypercholesterolemia, taking beta-sitosterol 1 grams three times daily in combination with the fibrate drug bezafibrate 200 mg once daily for 24 months reduces cholesterol as effectively as taking bezafibrate 200 mg twice daily.

Topical beta-sitosterol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying an ointment containing sesame oil, beta-sitosterol, berberine, and other plant ingredients (MEBO) is as effective as applying silver sulfadiazine dressing twice daily for healing burns and preventing bacterial infection (13526). Furthermore, this ointment appears to be more effective than povidone-iodine plus bepanthenol cream for reducing pain. The ointment can also shorten the hospital stay of these patients by almost one day when compared with povidone-iodine plus bepanthenol (35118). However, when used for second-degree facial burns, this ointment increases healing time by about 2 days and worsens pain and discomfort when compared with a specific dressing containing ionic silver (Aquacel Ag Hydrofiber) (35117). The ointment has been applied to partial-thickness burns as a thick layer every 4-12 hours for up to 18 days or until release from the hospital in patients aged 2 years and older (13526, 35117, 35118).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary beta-sitosterol is beneficial for cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that although the highest intake of plant sterols is associated with a reduced risk of having cancer when compared with the lowest intake, there is no association between beta-sitosterol itself and cancer risk (106084).

However, when corrected for cholesterol levels, the reduced levels are still within normal range. Therefore, this interaction does not seem to be clinically significant (5814, 7105, 15390, 35022, 35034, 35076, 90727, 90741, 96274).\nTopical:\nBeta-sitosterol has been used in an ointment.

People with this disorder have increased absorption of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol from the diet, and decreased clearance of beta-sitosterol. Total body stores of beta-sitosterol are increased up to 17-fold. Elevated hepatic beta-sitosterol levels competitively inhibit cholesterol catabolism, contributing to hypercholesterolemia (3663). Patients with sitosterolemia are prone to premature coronary artery disease and xanthomas (3661, 3662). Beta-sitosterol and its glycoside sitosterolin are contraindicated in patients with sitosterolemia. However, beta-sitosterol appears to be safe for heterozygous carriers of sitosterolemia (10457).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with beta-sitosterol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOrally, beta-sitosterol intake increases blood levels of beta-sitosterol (35022, 35029, 35164). However, the increases are generally small (65749, 90741). Beta-sitosterol has low bioavailability; only 2% to 6% is absorbed in the intestine, while the rest is excreted in the feces (112083).\nDistribution\nIn humans, dietary intake of plant sterols including beta-sitosterol increases beta-sitosterol levels in the skin (35164).\nExcretion\nIn human research, the half-life of beta-sitosterol following the intravenous bolus injection of a chylomicron-like lipid emulsion containing triglycerides, cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, and squalene, was 17 minutes, returning to baseline 45 minutes after injection (34989). Beta-sitosterol is excreted in bile and feces (34989, 35149).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBeta-sitosterol is a plant sterol, constituting 60% to 90% of total sterols found in plant-based foods. It has a chemical structure similar to cholesterol with an ethyl group added at position 24. The average diet provides about 175-200 mg of beta-sitosterol, but less than 5% is actually absorbed when consumed orally. Therefore, these plant sterols do not cause some of the atherogenic adverse effects associated with cholesterol from animal products. Beta-sitosterol is commonly added to margarines as a cholesterol reducing aid. Fats are needed to solubilize plant sterols so margarines are an ideal vehicle. Soybean phytosterols containing 48% beta-sitosterol, 26% campesterol, and 21% stigmasterol have been added to ground beef (8528, 112083). Capsules containing beta-sitosterol may not disperse properly in the gut, limiting their ability to reduce cholesterol absorption (5814).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that beta-sitosterol might have anticancer effects. Beta-sitosterol can inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cells in vitro. Mechanisms of action have involved membrane signaling, caspases, and inflammatory mediators (3667, 3668, 34976, 35017, 35036, 35058).\nHormonal effects\nInhibition of 5-alpha reductase, which prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), may contribute to the activity of beta-sitosterol in androgenic alopecia. Reduction of cholesterol bioavailability by beta-sitosterol may also reduce biosynthesis of testosterone and DHT (15550). It is suggested that androgenic alopecia involves increased sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT, reducing their growth phase and size (15550).\nImmunological effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that beta-sitosterol might have immunostimulant effects. Mixtures of beta-sitosterol and its glycoside sitosterolin seem to also enhance proliferative responses of T-cells in vitro (3669, 5342). Beta-sitosterol might also reduce the mild immune suppression and inflammation seen in marathon runners after a race (5335).\nLipid-lowering effects\nBeta-sitosterol inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol by competing for the limited space in mixed micelles, which decreases cholesterol absorption by about 50% (5814, 112081). However, because there is less cholesterol available in the body, compensatory mechanisms kick in and increase cholesterol synthesis in the liver (5814).\nProstate effects\nFor prostatic hyperplasia, animal research suggests that beta-sitosterol might inhibit 5-alpha reductase activity, although finasteride (Proscar) appears to be more potent (11759). Laboratory research suggests beta-sitosterol might have antiproliferative effects on the prostate, possibly by inhibiting growth factors (11234). In animals, beta-sitosterol shrinks the prostate, but this has not been shown in humans (11759).\nWeight-reducing effects\nBeta-sitosterol downregulates c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and the IKK-beta / NF-kappa-B signaling pathway, reducing adipose tissue mass and inhibiting preadipocyte proliferation (112083)."

            "Safety": "LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally, long-term or in high doses. Constituents of betel nut have documented carcinogenic potential, and betel nut use has been associated with precancerous lesions and carcinoma in long-term users (6, 17, 35216, 35238, 35240, 35296, 35312, 35321, 96983, 102877). Chewing betel nut has been associated with chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, coma, dyspnea and tachypnea, acute myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, liver fibrosis, heart failure, and death (35224, 35294, 35327, 35351, 35353, 102878, 102879, 109490, 109487). Eating betel nut 8-30 grams can cause death (6).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of short-term use of betel nut.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Betel nut has carcinogenic potential as well as central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and cholinergic properties and might adversely affect pregnancy and nursing infants (6, 17); avoid using.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nBetel nut is generally regarded as unsafe for use. Any benefits of therapy may not outweigh the risk of toxicity. Orally, betel nut use is associated with precancerous lesions and carcinoma in long-term users (35216, 35238, 35240, 35296, 35312, 35321, 35335, 96983, 102877, 109484, 109445, 109489, 109493). Chewing betel nut has also been associated with chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, hypotension, coma, dyspnea and tachypnea, acute myocardial infarction, liver fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, diverticulosis, oral submucous fibrosis, more difficult tracheal intubation, and death (35224, 35294, 35327, 35351, 35353, 102878, 109443, 109444, 109486, 109487, 109488, 109490). Rarely, chewing betel nut has been reported to cause cholinergic crisis, as well as dizziness, numbness, seizures, difficulty breathing, and coma (35204, 35224, 35232, 35235, 35323). Less serious adverse effects of chewing betel nut, either alone or as part of betel quid, have included stained teeth and mouth, tooth wear, periodontitis, gingivitis, increased risk of diabetes, and gastrointestinal issues (6, 18, 35211, 35224, 35233, 35246, 35249, 35270, 35273, 35276)(35284, 35326, 49519, 102879). Habituation and dependence can also occur in users of betel nut (35301, 35331).\nCardiovascular\nChewing betel nut has been associated with short-term chest pain, ventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia or a slight increased heart rate, palpitations, hypotension, and myocardial infarction (35224, 35294, 35327, 35351, 35353, 102879). Increased systolic blood pressure has occurred in new chewers of betel nut (35327). Although most individuals recovered within 24 hours, there are some cases of death associated with acute myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation (35224, 35353). Observational research in adults hospitalized with cardiopulmonary symptoms has found that chewing betel nut is associated with premature ventricular contractions and heart failure (109490).\n\nSome, but not all, population research suggests that chewing betel nut increases the risk of cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular disease (35281, 35287, 35290). Population research has also found that chewing betel nut is associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Population research also suggests that these risks increase with longer durations of betel nut use (109485).\nless\nDental\nChewing betel nut, either alone or as part of betel quid, has been reported to cause tooth wear or abrasion, periodontitis, gingivitis, and red-stained teeth (6, 35233, 35276, 35284).\nless\nDermatologic\nChewing betel nut can cause red-stained mouth and lips (18).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome population research suggests that chewing betel nut, either alone or as part of betel quid, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, not all research supports this relationship. Also, any increased risk is possibly related to the fact that consuming betel nut is also associated with an increased rate of obesity (35211, 35246, 35249, 35270, 35273, 35326, 109485).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, consuming betel nut may cause vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea (6, 35224). Chewing betel nut causes red-stained mouth, lips, and feces (18, 35233).\n\nPopulation research in adult males has found that chewing betel nut is associated with 59% to 70% greater odds of having diverticulosis when compared with non-users (109488).\n\nBetel nut chewing can also cause oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) in susceptible individuals (327, 328, 329, 109444). Chewing betel nut chronically (daily for at least 5 years) is also associated with more difficult tracheal intubations, which is believed to result from OSMF (109443).\n\nIn one case report, a 35-year-old female developed sore throat, dysphagia, and heartburn thought to be related to consuming betel nut as part of daily handfuls of pan masala (49519). In another case, a 45-year-old male presented with swallowing obstruction one hour after chewing betel nut. Upon examination, submucosal hematoma and multiple esophageal lesions were observed (102879).\nless\nHepatic\nPopulation research in adults with metabolic syndrome has found that chewing betel nut is associated with 5.5 times greater odds of having liver fibrosis when compared with non-users. However, in adults without metabolic syndrome, chewing betel nut was not associated with liver fibrosis (109487).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn one case report, cheilitis granulomatosa, a painless swelling of the lips, occurred after chewing betel quid. However, the patient was determined to be allergic to betel leaves (Piper betel) and not to betel nut. Betel leaves are not related to betel nut (96984).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, betel nut has rarely been reported to cause cholinergic crisis with salivation, sweating, eye tearing, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, gastrointestinal upset, and vomiting (35204, 35224, 35323). Dizziness, numbness, and coma have also been reported rarely (35224). In a case report, seizures were related to intake of betel nuts (35232).\nless\nOncologic\nPopulation research has found that chewing betel nut, either alone or as part of betel quid, increases the risk of cervical dysplasia, colorectal polyps, esophageal cancer, oral cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer (35216, 35238, 35240, 35296, 35312, 35321, 35335, 96983, 102877, 109484, 109493). Population research in adults with oropharyngeal or oral cancer also suggests that a history of chewing betel nut and continued betel nut chewing both reduce 5-year overall survival when compared with non-users (109484, 109489). A meta-analysis of observational studies also suggests that quitting betel-nut use reduces the risk of developing pharyngeal cancer when compared with continued use (109445).\nless\nPsychiatric\nHabituation and dependence can occur in users of betel nut (35301, 35331). Signs of withdrawal, such as anxiety, despondency, and memory lapses, also occur (35309).\n\nSome research has evaluated medications that may improve betel nut cessation. Preliminary clinical research in males with betel nut dependence shows that taking escitalopram 10 mg or moclobemide 150 mg orally daily for 8 weeks increases the likelihood of cessation by 6.3 and 6.8 times that of placebo, respectively (109494).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nChewing betel nut has been reported to cause trouble breathing (35224, 35235).\nless\nRenal\nA meta-analysis of population research shows that betel nut chewing is associated with 44% greater odds of developing chronic kidney disease when compared with non-users (102878). Population research in adult males has also found that chewing betel nut is associated with 1% to 25% greater odds of developing nephrolithiasis when compared with non-users. Population research suggests that these risks increase in subjects that use higher quantities of betel nut (109486).\n\nAdditionally, two patients who chewed large quantities of betel nuts prepared in a paste of calcium carbonate from oyster shells developed milk-alkali syndrome, characterized by hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and renal insufficiency. The abnormalities resolved after discontinuation of the mixture and intravenous saline. This adverse effect was attributed to the large intake of calcium, 6-9 grams, in the preparation, and not to the use of betel nut (35345).\nless\nOther\nOrally, consuming betel nut 8-30 grams has been reported to cause death (6).\nless",

Other alkaloids include arecaidine, guvacine, and guvacoline (6081, 35365, 49519).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nPreliminary observational research shows that subjects with betel nut dependence have altered function in the prefrontal cortex when compared with non-users. Some researchers believe this may be responsible for cravings (109495).\n\nSome researchers have also suggested that chewing betel nut may impair memory. However, preliminary observational research in males that also use tobacco and alcohol did not find an association between betel nut dependence and working memory or remote memory performance (109491).\nCholinergic effects\nAlkaloid components in betel nut have cholinergic action. The cholinergic effects of arecoline are thought to be the reason for improvement in psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who chew betel nut (6081). Additionally, arecoline is likely responsible for the cholinergic toxicity that is sometimes seen following use of betel nut (35204, 35323).\nMutagenic effects\nThe constituents arecaidine and arecoline have carcinogenic potential (6), and chewing betel nut has been associated with cervical dysplasia, esophageal cancer, and oral cancer (35216, 35238, 35240, 35296, 35312, 35321, 35335, 96983). Chewing betel nuts increases the generation of free radicals in the saliva (35324). Chewing betel quid increases DNA mutations and breaks and causes cells to divide faster (35212, 35223, 35231, 35241, 35242, 35258, 35259). The betel nut constituents arecaidine and arecoline induce cell proliferation and prevent DNA repair (35308, 35320, 35339, 96983)."

            "Overview": "The genus Bifidobacterium are a group of lactic acid- and acetic acid-producing bacteria that are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract (1137, 92267). Bifidobacterium lactis is a subspecies of B. animalis. B. lactis and other species of Bifidobacterium are included in probiotic supplements (1060, 1137, 92267). Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using B. lactis or other species of Bifidobacterium for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, B. lactis is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Bifidobacterium lactis has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in clinical trials lasting up to 12 weeks (92255, 98502, 105158, 107572, 107581, 107586, 110979, 110985, 110986, 110992)(110993, 110998, 110999).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Bifidobacterium lactis has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in infants and children for up to 15 months (3169, 3458, 92265, 95381, 95382, 98736, 105149, 107582, 107583, 107585)(107587, 107590, 110984, 110987, 110988, 110991, 110994, 110995). A combination probiotic containing B. lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus (HOWARU Protect, Danisco) has been used safely for up to 6 months in children aged 3-5 years (16847). A specific combination of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and L. acidophilus (Complete Probiotic Platinum) has also been used safely for up to 18 months in children aged 4 months to 5 years (103436). In addition, in children ages 4-17 years, 1 billion CFUs of a 1:1:1 combination of B. lactis CECT 8145, Lacticasebacillus casei CECT 9104, and Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 has been used safely for 12 weeks (107531). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of B. lactis in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available. A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy increases the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by 85% when compared with placebo. Although the specific effects of Bifidobacterium lactis are unclear from this analysis, three of the included studies used B. lactis in combination with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (105185). More information is needed to determine if certain patients are at increased risk.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Bifidobacterium lactis seems to be well tolerated by most patients.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that probiotics may cause infections in some people.\nDermatologic\nIn clinical research, two cases of rash, one with itching, were reported by patients taking a combination of Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei F19, and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5. However, it is not clear if these adverse effects were due to B. lactis, other probiotics, or the combination, or if the events were idiosyncratic (90236).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nBloating and flatulence have been reported with probiotic use; however, these adverse effects have not been reported from ingestion of Bifidobacterium lactis in particular. When taken orally, B. lactis can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints in children (3169, 95381, 105149). Gastrointestinal complaints including worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, stomach burn, and flatulence have been reported rarely (110986, 110999).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere have been cases of Bifidobacterium bacteremia in critically ill patients (102416, 107599). These cases are rare and none seem to be due to Bifidobacterium lactis alone.\n\nA specific preparation (NBL probiotic ATP, Nobel) containing B. lactis, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, colostrum, and lactoferrin was found to be a significant risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization in premature infants. Although there was no direct link to determine causation, it was hypothesized that the probiotic mixture helped to mediate the acquisition and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (96890).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nColic. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis seems to be beneficial for colic.\nClinical research in infants with colic shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen, Hoersholm or Bifidolactis Infant, Sofar SpA) drops providing 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 or 4 weeks modestly reduces the daily number of crying episodes by about 2.5 when compared with placebo. The proportion of infants with at least a 50% reduction in crying time from baseline was 61% to 80%, compared with 22% to 32% of those taking placebo. Use of B. lactis also resulted in increased sleep time, reduced crying duration, and improved physical and emotional functioning of the caregiver. Stool frequency was decreased in one study, but was not changed in the other (107583, 107587).\nless\nConstipation. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis seems to be beneficial for constipation.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking B. lactis increases bowel movement frequency by about 1.5 stools weekly in adults with functional constipation. Specific strains used include LMG P-21384 as 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, Bi-07 as 100 million CFUs daily, DN-173 010 as 12.5 billion CFUs daily, and GCL2505 as 10 billion CFUs daily for 2-4 weeks (95342). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with chronic constipation shows that taking B. lactis modestly increases stool frequency when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect of taking B. lactis on treatment success, stool consistency, severity of straining or bloating, or gut transit time. Due to the small number of studies, the effect of B. lactis on other symptoms of constipation is unclear from this analysis (110874). A third meta-analysis shows that two specific strains of B. lactis, HN019 and DN-173 010, have medium to large effects on intestinal transit time in mainly healthy adults (110983). The effect of these strains on intestinal transit time in patients with constipation is unclear from this analysis. Clinical research in patients with low defecation frequency also shows that taking the specific B. lactis strain BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) 1-10 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks increases the odds of improved defecation frequency by about 1.3-fold when compared with placebo (92264). It is possible that any beneficial effect is limited to patients with more severe constipation. One clinical study in patients with functional constipation shows that taking the specific B. lactis strain HN019, 1 or 10 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks, has no effect on bowel movements when compared with placebo. However, in a post-hoc analysis of patients with three or less weekly stools, this strain of B. lactis modestly increased bowel movements when compared with placebo (98737). Another clinical study in patients with mild chronic constipation shows that taking B. lactis NCC2818 15 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks does not affect gut transit time, stool output, or symptoms when compared with placebo (102411).\n\nB. lactis has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical trial using a specific combination product (ID-HWS1000) containing B. lactis IDCC 4301, Bifidobacterium breve IDCC 4401, Lacticaseibacillus casei IDCC 3451, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IDCC 3501, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201, Lactococcus lactis IDCC 2301, xylooligosaccharide, and dietary fiber as nondigestible maltodextrin, oat fiber, and psyllium husk fiber daily for 4 weeks modestly increases stool frequency and improves symptoms of functional constipation in adults when compared with placebo (107517). Another small clinical trial shows that taking yogurt 180 mL providing B. lactis HN019, L. acidophilus NCFM, and polydextrose (Litesse) daily for 2 weeks modestly improves clinical response and reduces transit time when compared with taking a control yogurt. However, there was no effect on the number of daily bowel movements (90275). Other studies have used B. lactis UABla-12, Bl-04, Bi-07, and/or HN019 in combination with Bifidobacterium bifidum UABb-10, Bifidobacterium longum UABl-14, Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) for 4 weeks (110970) or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37 for 2 weeks (110979). However, there was a general lack of support for symptom improvement from these studies.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of IBS when used alone. Its benefits when used in combination with other probiotics are unclear.\nClinical research in adults with IBS shows that taking B. lactis UABla-12 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks modestly reduces the severity of abdominal pain when compared with placebo. Also, 28% of patients responded to treatment by having more than a 30% reduction in pain severity, compared with only 16% of those taking placebo. There were also improvements in abdominal distention, duration of pain, and bowel habits (107581). Additional clinical research in children aged 4-16 years shows that taking B. lactis B19 10 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks reduces bloating, feelings of abdominal fullness, and difficulty with defecation in 25% to 50% of patients with IBS (95350).\n\nSome research has also evaluated B. lactis in combination with other probiotics. Clinical research shows that taking a product (Duolac Care) containing B. lactis, Bifidobacterium breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice daily for 4 weeks can relieve symptoms in 72% of patients with IBS (95353). Another clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing B. lactis BL040, B. breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, L. acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, L. plantarum LP140, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516). However, multiple studies show that taking capsules or drinking fermented milk containing a combination of B. lactis BB-12, L. paracasei, and L. acidophilus La510 as 26 billion CFUs total twice daily for 2-6 months does not improve gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS (90236, 94696, 94697).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Most clinical research shows that taking Bifidobacterium lactis alone or in combination with other probiotics may reduce the risk of respiratory infections in otherwise healthy individuals. In patients who are not otherwise healthy, most clinical research shows that taking oral B. lactis has not demonstrated benefit.\nClinical research in infants aged 6 to 12 months shows that taking B. lactis HN019 one million colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of follow-on formula daily for 12 weeks reduces the incidence of confirmed (9.4% vs. 0.0%) and parentally reported (25.0% vs. 9.4%) upper respiratory tract infections when compared to formula without added probiotics. Infants consumed an average of 141 grams of formula daily (110988). Another clinical trial in one month old infants shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 10 billion CFUs daily for an average of about 15 months reduces the proportion of children with respiratory tract infections until age 2 by 13% when compared with taking placebo. The frequency of recurrent respiratory tract infections was not different between groups (95381). In contrast, other clinical research in children attending day care shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 one billion CFUs daily for 3 months does not reduce the duration or incidence of respiratory tract infections (95382).\n\nMost research in children also shows that taking B. lactis in combination with other ingredients reduces the risk of respiratory infections. One clinical study shows that children ages 3-5 years who attend day-care centers have significantly fewer influenza-like respiratory symptoms when given milk containing a specific combination of 5 billion CFUs each of B. lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus (HOWARU Protect, Danisco). Children taking this product seem to have a 45% lower risk of experiencing fever, cough, and rhinorrhea when compared with placebo. The duration of symptoms was also 2 days shorter. These patients were also less likely to use an antibiotic for their symptoms (16847). A clinical study in healthy children aged 3-10 years shows that taking 12.5 billion CFUs daily of a specific combination of B. lactis CUL34 (Lab4), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20, and L. acidophilus CUL21 and CUL60, plus vitamin C 50 mg daily reduces the risk of cough by 16% and sore throat by 20% and modestly reduces school absenteeism and antibiotic use when compared with placebo. However, nasal symptoms, fever, and wheezing were not reduced (106943). Another clinical study in children 3-12 years of age with a sick household member shows that taking a combination product (Up4-Junior, UAS Laboratories) containing B. lactis UABLA-12 4 billion CFUs and L. acidophilus DDS-1 1 billion CFUs with fructo-oligosaccharides 50 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly shortens the duration of respiratory infections, but does not reduce the risk of developing an infection, when compared with placebo (98439). In healthy children ages 3-6 years, taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and Enterococcus faecium L3 (iNatal Ped, Pharmextracta SpA) 2 billion CFUs each daily for 3 months reduces the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections by 84% compared with children not taking probiotics. The duration of infections was reduced by 50% (110991).\n\nThe effect of B. lactis on respiratory tract infections has also been examined in adults. In healthy overweight adults or adults with obesity, taking 50 billion CFUs of a specific combination of B. lactis (Lab4P), B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum for 24 weeks reduces the overall likelihood of having upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as sneezing, cough, and blocked nose, by approximately 40% when compared with placebo (103439). In college students, clinical research shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LGG one billion CFUs each daily for 12 weeks reduces the duration of upper respiratory tract infection by about 2 days when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was reduced by 34%. There was also a small reduction in the number of missed school days, but not work days (110993).\n\nSome research has investigated the effects of B. lactis on respiratory tract infection outcomes in patients who are not otherwise healthy. One clinical trial in children hospitalized with an acute respiratory tract infection shows that taking B. lactis Probio-M8 20 billion CFUs daily from admission until 4 weeks after discharge modestly reduces the duration of nasal, throat, and general aching symptoms when compared with taking placebo. Taking B. lactis also modestly reduced the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization of at least 7 days (110984). Despite these findings, another clinical trial in children and adolescents who are hospitalized shows that taking B. lactis 100 million CFUs daily during a hospital stay does not reduce the incidence or duration of respiratory infections, including common cold, rhinitis, sinusitis, and others, when compared with placebo (92265). Also, in older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 13-16 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the incidence of upper or lower respiratory infections when compared with placebo over a 12-month period, and increases the use of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections by 2.2 days (103425).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nDental caries. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis does not seem to be beneficial for preventing dental caries in young children.\nClinical research in infants shows that giving B. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 (Chr. Hansen A/S) 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, starting at age 1-2 months and continuing for an average of 15 months, through a sustained-release pacifier or tablet does not reduce the incidence of dental caries at age 4 when compared with placebo (107588).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-17 years with allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific combination product (Inatal ped Pharmaextracta) containing B. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 and Enterococcus faecium L3 LMG P-27496 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each with oligofructose daily for 3 months prior to a high allergen exposure period the period modestly reduces symptoms of allergic rhinitis and the need for corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines when compared with baseline (107582). However, other clinical research shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing B. lactis BB-12 50 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG 50 billion CFUs, and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 5 billion CFUs from 36 weeks' gestation until 3 months postpartum does not reduce the incidence of allergic rhinitis in the child at 6 years of age when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults shows that taking B. lactis in combination with up to 8 other probiotic strains reduces the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 30% when compared with taking placebo (107635). However, individual clinical trials have mixed results. Some specific combination products containing B. bifidum have shown benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). One such product is Ecologic AAD, which contains B. lactis NIZO 3680, Bifidobacterium bifidum NIZO 3804, Enterococcus faecium NIZO 3886, L. acidophilus NIZO 3678 and NIZO 3887, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei NIZO 3672, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NIZO 3684, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus NIZO 3689, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius NIZO 3675. Another evaluated product contains B. lactis BB-12 5.9 billion CFUs daily, L. rhamnosus GG 5.2 billion CFUs, and L. acidophilus La-5 8.3 billion CFUs daily. However, other combinations do not appear to be beneficial. These include B. lactis BB-12 and L. acidophilus LA-5; B. lactis BB-12 and L. rhamnosus; B. lactis, B. bifidum, and L. acidophilus; and B. lactis W51, B. bifidum W23, L. acidophilus W37, L. acidophilus W55, L. paracasei W20, L. plantarum W62, L. rhamnosus W71, and L. salivarius W24 (90239, 92255, 94692, 95348, 95405, 103425, 110969). It is too soon to know which combinations might be most beneficial, if any, for preventing AAD.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of atopic dermatitis.\nSome research has evaluated B. lactis for TREATING atopic dermatitis. One very small clinical study shows that giving infants a formula containing B. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) 30-80 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily helps reduce the severity of eczema and the markers for allergic responses, including soluble CD4 in serum and eosinophilic protein X in urine when compared with baseline (3458). However, preliminary clinical research shows that giving B. lactis CNCM I-3446 10 billion CFUs to infants as an adjunct to standard topical treatment daily for 3 months does not reduce eczema severity when compared with placebo (90256). B. lactis has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients. In children, taking B. lactis as part of a multi-ingredient formulation for 8 or 12 weeks modestly reduces symptom severity and the need for topical corticosteroids when compared with placebo (107531, 110995). In these studies, 1 billion CFUs of a 1:1:1 combination of B. lactis CECT 8145, Lacticaseibacillus casei CECT 9104, and Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 daily was used in children ages 4-17 years for 12 weeks (107531) or B. lactis UABLA-12 was taken in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 for a total of 10 billion CFUs daily along with fructo-oligosaccharide 100 mg (DDS Junior) daily for 8 weeks by children ages 1-3 years (110995).\n\nB. lactis-containing probiotics have also been investigated for PREVENTING atopic dermatitis. A meta-analysis of small- to medium-sized studies shows that providing mixed strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria to infants during pregnancy and/or in early infancy prevents atopic dermatitis in the child by approximately 40% over the next 0.5-2 years (107503). Although this analysis was not limited to studies examining the effects of B. lactis, seven of the nine studies used B. lactis as part of a combination product. Individual studies included in the analysis have shown that taking a combination of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei during pregnancy from approximately 35 weeks' gestation until birth, and then giving this combination to the infant after birth until 6 months of age, does not reduce the incidence of eczema at age 2 years, although it does appear to reduce the risk of atopic sensitization by 57% (90234). A secondary analysis of a clinical study included in this analysis in infants aged 8-14 months found that taking a daily mixture of B. lactis and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1 billion CFUs each daily for 6 months is associated with a lower incidence of eczema when compared with placebo (102286). Also, some clinical research shows that supplementation with 250 mL of fermented milk containing B. lactis BB-12, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 starting at 36 weeks' gestation and continuing until 3 months postpartum, without supplementation in the infant, reduces the overall occurrence of atopic dermatitis in the child at 2 years of age. At 6 years of age, the effect appears to be inconclusive (96893).\nless\nBipolar disorder. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with bipolar disorder who were recently hospitalized for a manic episode shows that taking a combination probiotic containing B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG 100 million colony-forming units daily for 24 weeks reduces the risk of rehospitalization when compared with placebo. The hazard ratio for the first rehospitalization due to worsening of psychiatric symptoms was 0.37 for the combination probiotic group when compared with placebo. Among patients who were re-hospitalized, taking the combination probiotic reduced the mean duration of rehospitalization by 5.4 days when compared with placebo (96896).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium lactis for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. lactis for this condition.\nCanker sores. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small study shows that taking a combination of B. lactis, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus reduces pain, but does not affect the number of lesions or healing time, when compared with placebo. Also, another small study shows that using lozenges providing inulin 0.13 gram along with B. lactis and L. acidophilus 1.5 billion colony-forming units each reduces pain, but does not affect ulcer size or healing, when compared with Oracure gel (105146).\nless\nChild development. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn 11-year follow-up study evaluating B. lactis and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus taken daily during pregnancy from 35 weeks' gestation until birth, or six months after birth if breastfeeding, and then giving the same supplement to the infant until 2 years of age, does not affect neurocognitive outcomes such as attention, intelligence, executive function, depression, and anxiety when compared with those taking placebo (102287).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in multi-trauma patients requiring ventilation shows that taking a combination probiotic containing B. lactis twice daily for 15 days modestly reduces the risk of sepsis, as well as the length of stay in the ICU and hospital, when compared with placebo. The product contained B. lactis BB12 1.75 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion CFUs, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 500 million CFUs, and Saccharomyces boulardii 1.5 billion CFUs. Half of the dose was given onto the oropharynx and half via a nasogastric tube (107524).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for preventing dental plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming a yogurt supplemented with B. lactis DN-173010 100 million colony-forming units daily between breakfast and lunch for 4 weeks does not prevent gingivitis or plaque when compared with a placebo yogurt. However, following a non-brushing period of 5 days, both gingivitis and plaque were modestly reduced in individuals consuming the B. lactis-containing yogurt (98502).\n\nClinical research in adolescent boys aged 13-15 years with mild to moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking two lozenges containing B. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (Probiotical SpA) twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce plaque when compared with placebo. However, there was a benefit on levels of some salivary and plaque pathogenic bacteria. Each lozenge provided B. lactis BB-12 470 million colony-forming units (CFUs) and L. rhamnosus 440 million CFUs (107574). Conversely, a small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking four lozenges daily providing a total daily dose of 2 billion CFUs each of B. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 (Chr. Hansen A/S) and L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Probiotical SpA) for 4 weeks modestly reduces plaque when compared with placebo (107572).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy is unlikely to prevent gestational diabetes and increases the risk of pre-eclampsia by 85% when compared with placebo. Although the specific effects of B. lactis are unclear from this analysis, three of the included studies used B. lactis in combination with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (105185). Other clinical research that has found no benefit has used B. lactis BB-12 and L. rhamnosus GG at least 1 billion CFUs daily from 16-20 weeks' gestation until 28 weeks' gestation, or B. lactis 420 DSM 22089 (Dupont Nutrition & Health) and L. rhamnosus HN001 ATCC SD5675 as 10 billion CFUs each daily throughout pregnancy, with or without fish oil (102284, 105144). Conversely, one small clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes shows that taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LBY-27 for 8 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and improves insulin sensitively when compared with placebo (96892).\n\nIn children aged 8-17 years with type I diabetes, taking B. lactis Bb12 DSM 15954 and L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 1 billion CFUs daily for 6 months does not reduce insulin requirements or levels of glycated hemoglobin over 12 months when compared with placebo. In addition, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected (107518).\n\nA small clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking fermented goat milk 120 grams containing one billion colony-forming units each of B. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 daily for 6 weeks modestly reduces levels of glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not fasting blood glucose or insulin resistance, when compared with conventional fermented milk containing Streptococcus thermophilus TA-40 (110973).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea.\nThe European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, B. lactis is not a specific focus of the guidelines and most evidence is low quality. Clinical research shows that B. lactis reduces the duration of acute diarrhea in children by about one day (107636). In older adults in long-term care, clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 13-16 billion colony-forming units daily does not reduce the incidence or duration of diarrhea over a 12-month period when compared with placebo (103425).\nless\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 6-18 years of age with high cholesterol shows that taking a probiotic containing B. lactis MB 2409, Bifidobacterium bifidum MB 109, and Bifidobacterium longum BL04 daily for 12 weeks decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by 2% to 3% and increases HDL cholesterol levels by about 2% when compared with placebo. However, these changes might not be considered clinically significant (98736).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with GAD shows that taking sertraline 25 mg plus probiotics daily for 8 weeks may modestly reduce some symptoms of anxiety when compared with sertraline alone. However, the reduction in anxiety score was small and change was not consistent between rating scales. Also, the quality of life was not improved. The probiotics provided a total of 18 billion colony-forming units of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (110977).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming a yogurt supplemented with B. lactis DN-173010 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily between breakfast and lunch for 4 weeks does not prevent gingivitis or plaque when compared with a placebo yogurt. However, following a non-brushing period of 5 days, both gingivitis and plaque were modestly reduced in individuals consuming the B. lactis-containing yogurt (98502). Another clinical trial following cleaning in patients with gingivitis shows that taking lozenges containing B. lactis HN019 (HOWARU Bifdo LYO 40 DCU-S, Danisco) one billion CFUs twice daily for 8 weeks increases the proportion of patients without generalized gingivitis by almost 50%, and modestly reduces bleeding with probing and gingivitis severity, compared with placebo lozenges. There was no effect on plaque (110992).\n\nB. lactis has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in adolescent boys aged 13-15 years with mild to moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking two lozenges containing B. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (Probiotical SpA) twice daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces gingivitis when compared with placebo. Each lozenge provided B. lactis BB-12 480 million colony-forming units (CFUs) and L. rhamnosus 440 million CFUs (107574). A small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking four lozenges daily providing a total daily dose of 2 billion CFUs each of B. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 (Chr. Hansen A/S) and L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Probiotical SpA) for 4 weeks modestly reduces plaque and gingivitis when compared with placebo (107572).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for H. pylori; some research suggests that B. lactis may minimize the adverse effects of H. pylori eradication therapy, but not all research agrees.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that adding B. lactis B94 7 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily to sequential H. pylori eradication therapy for 2 weeks results in an eradication rate of 87%, compared with 71% of those taking placebo or using no control along with sequential eradication therapy. Use of B. lactis also reduced treatment non-compliance due to diarrhea during the first week and reduced symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain. In order to have one beneficial outcome, 6.2 patients would need to take B. lactis. There was no overall effect on non-compliance related to diarrhea or to skin rash (107589). Another clinical study shows that taking a specific combination of B. lactis and a lactobacilli species (Ferzym, Specchiasol) 5 billion CFUs daily for one week during standard triple therapy and one week thereafter reduces some treatment-related adverse effects such as taste disturbances and diarrhea, although it does not seem to improve compliance (12763). However, there was no difference in eradication rates or symptom relief in children aged 6-16 years taking B. lactis B94 5 billion CFUs daily plus inulin 900 mg for 14 days along with standard triple therapy (107590). Discrepancies may be related to the population studied or to the B. lactis strain, the other ingredients, or the type of H. pylori treatment used in the available research.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of nine small to moderate-sized clinical studies shows that taking a combination of B. lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus reduces levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo (107591). Populations in the included clinical trials enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic syndrome, and others. The benefits of B. lactis in patients with hypercholesterolemia are unclear.\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking 10 billion colony-forming units each of B. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 twice daily for 12 weeks does not increase the proportion of patients with a reduction in weekly bowel frequency of at least 50% when compared with placebo. Also, there was no effect of this combination on stool consistency or abdominal symptoms. However, there were some modest benefits when compared with baseline (110999). This study was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences.\nless\nMalnourishment-related diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 6 months to 4 years of age hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LGG 5 billion colony-forming units each daily during hospitalization and for 8-12 weeks as an outpatient does not affect diarrhea incidence or severity or the number of days with diarrhea during hospitalization. However, the number of days with diarrhea as an outpatient was reduced by 2.2 days (110996).\nless\nMalnutrition. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 6 months to 4 years of age hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LGG 5 billion colony-forming units each daily during hospitalization and for 8-12 weeks as an outpatient does not affect pneumonia incidence, duration, or severity, weight gain, duration of hospitalization, or other outcomes (110996).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nIn patients with metabolic syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking fermented milk 80 mL providing B. lactis HN019 27.2 billion colony-forming units daily for 45 days reduces body mass index by approximately 4% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by approximately 14% when compared with no treatment. There was no effect on waist circumference, glucose control, or other blood lipids (105154).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research generally show that giving various bifidobacteria species alone does NOT reduce the risk of NEC or all-cause mortality. However, only a few of the studies included in these analyses have used B. lactis (95344, 95351, 103437, 105164). A systematic review of four studies using B. lactis shows that although NEC incidence is reduced by 89% in one study, a significant reduction was not identified in the other studies when compared with placebo (107592). A network meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking a combination probiotic containing B. lactis Bb-12, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis Bb-02, and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4, reduces the risk of NEC by 71% when compared with control (102437). Despite these findings, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, B. lactis is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for neonatal jaundice.\nClinical research in newborns with jaundice shows that taking B. lactis CP-9 5 billion colony-forming units twice daily during conventional phototherapy treatment reduces the duration of phototherapy by about 13 hours and modestly improves the decline in serum bilirubin when compared with taking placebo. A sub-analysis shows that this benefit is limited to full-term, and not preterm, newborns (110987).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children with NAFLD, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination (Prokid, Gostaresh Milad Pouya Company) containing B. lactis DSMZ 32269 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC B3208 3 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus DSMZ 21690 2 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC SD6576 2 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks normalizes liver sonography findings in 53% of children, compared with 17% of those taking placebo. In addition, levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase are reduced by 30% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect on body mass index or blood lipids when compared with placebo (105156). However, other research in adults with NAFLD shows that taking probiotic yogurt 100 grams fortified with vitamin D 1000 IU plus B. lactis Bb-12 and L. acidophilus 40 million CFUs daily for 3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, insulin levels, blood pressure, or anthropometric indices when compared with unfortified yogurt (105174).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for weight loss.\nClinical research in overweight and obese adults shows that taking B. lactis 420 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 months does not reduce body fat or body weight when compared with placebo (95356). However, in individuals with abdominal obesity, clinical research shows that taking B. lactis CECT 8145 (Ba8145) 10 billion CFUs for 3 months modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo. Also, taking heat-killed B. lactis CECT 8145 (Ba8145) 10 billion CFUs modestly decreases waist circumference when compared with placebo. Sub-group analyses show that these benefits occur only in females, and there was no effect of these products on the visceral or subcutaneous fat areas when compared with placebo (105551).\n\nAnother clinical trial shows that taking 10 billion colony-forming units each of B. lactis 420 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 daily, alone and with fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid 0.22 grams and docosahexaenoic acid 1.9 grams (Croda Europe Ltd.), during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum, reduces the odds of overweight at 24 months by approximately 64% or 78%, respectively, when compared with taking placebo (110336).\n\nWhen taken in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA02, B. lactis BS01 2 billion CFUs daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight or body fat when compared with placebo in young, healthy individuals, only some of whom were overweight (103438). In contrast to these findings, clinical research shows that taking 50 billion CFUs of a specific combination of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, L. acidophilus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lab4P) for 24 weeks reduces body weight by an additional 1.3 kg more than placebo (103439).\n\nHeat-killed B. lactis has also been investigated in combination with other ingredientd. Clinical research shows that taking enriched seafood sticks 50 grams daily providing heat-inactivated B. lactis CECT 8145 5 billion colony-forming units, inulin 1.7 grams, and eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid 370 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body fat, blood pressure, or most lipid or glycemic indices, when compared to taking conventional seafood sticks. There was a modest decrease in insulin levels in males (110997).\nless\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn older adults in long-term care, clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 13-16 billion colony-forming units daily does not reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis when compared with placebo over a 12-month period (103425).\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for preventing otitis media.\nClinical research in one month old infants shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 10 billion colony-forming units daily for an average of about 15 months does not reduce the proportion of children with otitis media by two years of age when compared with taking placebo (95381).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for periodontitis.\nIn patients with periodontitis, a small clinical trial shows that taking B. lactis HN019 lozenges providing 1 billion colony-forming units twice daily (HOWARU1 Bifido LYO 40 DCU-S, DuPont Danisco Sweeteners Oy) for 30 days after scaling and root planing modestly improves some measures of periodontitis 60 days after treatment completion, including pocket depth and clinical attachment, when compared with using placebo lozenges. In addition, although the risk for disease progression was not improved when compared with placebo, there was a reduction in the need for additional therapy in at least three sites (105157, 105158, 107622).\nless\nPostoperative bowel function. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for improving postoperative bowel function.\nClinical research in patients undergoing colorectal polyp resection shows that taking B. lactis MH-02 2 billion colony-forming units daily for 7 days postoperatively does not reduce total postoperative gastrointestinal symptom severity when compared with taking placebo. However, the time to recovery of bowel function was reduced by about 0.7 days and there were modest improvements in defecation difficulty (110985).\nless\nPostpartum depression. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of B. lactis 420 DSM 22,089 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 ATCC SD5675 (Dupont Nutrition & Health) 10 billion CFUs daily, alone or with fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.44 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 3.8 grams daily, does not reduce symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety when compared with placebo. Supplements were started in the second trimester of pregnancy and continued until 6 months after delivery (107496).\nless\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for PWS.\nA small clinical trial in children with PWS shows that taking B. lactis BPL1 CECT8145 (Archer Daniels Midland Co-Biópolis) 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 12 weeks does not improve fat mass, abdominal adiposity, lipid profile, blood pressure, or glucose control when compared with placebo. However, there was a small improvement in insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance. Also, abdominal adiposity was modestly improved in a sub-group of patients over age 4.5 years, the age at which excessive weight gain typically starts in this population (105149). Other clinical research in children with PWS shows that taking B. lactis BL-11 (Beijing Huayuan Academy of Biotechnology) 30 billion CFUs twice daily for 12 weeks does not affect weight or psychological outcomes, including behavior, communication, and motor skills, when compared with placebo. However, height and overall clinical impression were modestly improved (107585).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles comprised of six days with probiotics and two days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. lactis Bl-04, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Lb-87, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Ligilactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, and Lacticaseibacillus casei Lc-11, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium lactis is beneficial for preventing infections in premature infants.\nA small clinical trial in very low birth weight premature infants shows that taking B. lactis BB-12 two billion colony-forming units per kg six times daily from birth for 6 weeks does not reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections when compared with taking placebo (110994). This study may have been too small to detect differences.\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with psoriasis shows that taking a mixture of probiotics for 8 weeks modestly improves overall disease symptoms and feelings of depression when compared with placebo. The percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% or 75% reduction in overall symptom score was 40% and 24%, respectively, compared with 16% and 8% of those taking placebo. The probiotic was taken twice daily and provided a total daily dose of 2.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (107498).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with cervical cancer receiving radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Biogurt, Fame Pharmaceuticals) containing B. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion lyophilized live colony-forming units in a capsule three times daily throughout radiation treatment reduces the risk of diarrhea by 28% when compared with placebo. Taking probiotics also reduced the use of loperamide when compared with placebo (102285).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium lactis for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. lactis for this condition.\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral B. lactis is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nSmall clinical studies show that giving B. lactis BB-12 alone or along with Streptococcus thermophilus may help reduce the incidence of diarrhea and rotavirus shedding in infants and children up to 36 months old (3169).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a specific product (Probio-Tec AB-25) containing B. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is not beneficial for preventing relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis when compared with placebo (95338).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients in adults and children; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children aged 4 months to 5 years with a previous UTI, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination (Complete Probiotic Platinum) of B. lactis 750 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium bifidum 200 million CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus 750 million CFUs, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 50 million CFUs per kg twice daily for 18 months increases the median time to the first incidence of recurrence by approximately 3 months and increases the percentage of children without a UTI during the study period from 83% to 97% (103436). However, in older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and L. rhamnosus 13-16 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the incidence of UTI when compared with placebo over a 12-month period (103425).\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking B. lactis BB12 1.75 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion CFUs, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 500 million CFUs, and Saccharomyces boulardii 1.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 15 days reduces the risk of VAP to 12%, compared with 28% of patients taking placebo. Half of the dose was given onto the oropharynx and half via a nasogastric tube (107524).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Oral Bifidobacterium lactis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in inpatients aged 65 years or older shows that taking a combination of B. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus 60 billion colony-forming units daily for 21 days does not reduce the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea when compared with placebo (92255). Other combinations also do not appear to be beneficial, including a combination of B. lactis Bi-04, B. lactis Bi-07, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, as well as a combination of B. lactis Bb-12, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, and L. acidophilus La-5 (95364).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Bifidobacterium lactis for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBifidobacterium lactis has most often been used alone or in combination with other probiotics in doses of up to 12.5 billion colony-forming units daily for up to 6 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nBifidobacterium lactis has most often been used alone or in combination with other probiotics. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn clinical research, Bifidobacterium lactis supplements are often given as capsules or as a powder mixed with food or formula. Supplements used orally in clinical trials have used B. lactis alone or in combination with other species of probiotics or other ingredients.\n\nVarious species of B. lactis have been used in clinical research. One strain that is commonly used is B. lactis BB-12 (Christian Hansen A/S) (3458, 92264).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "IMMUNODEFICIENCY\nTheoretically, Bifidobacterium lactis preparations might cause pathogenic colonization in patients who are severely immunocompromised; use with caution in these patients. Although this has not occurred specifically with B. lactis, there have been rare cases involving other probiotic species. Pathogenic colonization seems to be more likely to occur in severely immunocompromised patients (4380, 4391, 4393, 4398, 102416).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Bifidobacterium lactis.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Bifidobacterium lactis is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of B. lactis may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605). For continued effect, B. lactis must be used regularly.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBifidobacterium lactis is a species of Bifidobacterium. Bifidobacteria are anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-positive bacteria that normally colonize in the human colon (1060, 1137). Bifidobacteria belong to a group of bacteria called lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are also found in fermented foods like yogurt and cheese (1055, 3589). Bifidobacteria are also in the adult colon, but are less predominant (1060).\n\nMost researchers agree that the effectiveness of B. lactis and other probiotics for all indications depends on their ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAntibacterial effects\nBifidobacteria appear to be the most important organisms in the intestine for providing a microbial barrier to infection. When used orally, some species of bifidobacteria pass through the gut and bind to the intestinal mucosa, preventing attachment of pathogenic coliform bacteria (1137, 1731, 16847). Some bifidobacteria produce antimicrobial substances that have activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (1060, 12774, 35433). B. lactis reduces the adhesion of Porphyromonas gingivalis to buccal epithelial cells, possibly explaining its proposed role in oral health (105157).\nAntibiotic adverse effects prevention\nBifidobacterium lactis, given in combination with lactobacillus concurrently with clindamycin, seems to prevent increases in the number of Bacteroides fragilis bacteria (11382). Also, taking B. lactis BB-12 in yogurt along with amoxicillin/clavulanate reduces the antibiotic-induced decrease in fecal short chain fatty acid levels and stabilizes the microbial profile in the absence of gut colonization of B. lactis itself (107586).\nDental effects\nBifidobacterium lactis is of interest for oral health. However, although some research disagrees, most research in humans shows that taking B. lactis alone does not reduce bacteria count or inflammatory markers in dental plaque, or reduce the incidence of dental caries, plaque, or gingivitis (95590, 98502, 107584, 107588).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBifidobacterium lactis is of interest for colic. Although colic has multiple causes, some research shows that giving B. lactis BB-12 to infants reduces crying episodes, and possibly affects stool frequency. Some research shows that this is related to changes in fecal levels of human beta defensin 2, cathelicidin, LL-37, secretory lgA, calprotectin, and butyrate (107583, 107587). B. lactis is also of interest for preventing ulcers and gastrointestinal inflammation. In animal research, B. lactis improves the integrity of tight junctions and protects against NSAID-induced mucosal permeability. However, in human research, taking B. lactis B420 did not protect against diclofenac-induced gastrointestinal inflammation (110986).\nImmune effects\nProbiotics might have immunomodulating effects (1137, 6099, 110995). The addition of Bifidobacterium lactis to milk enhances cellular immunity in healthy middle-aged and elderly people, improving phagocyte function and natural killer cell activity, and increasing production of interferon-alpha (1055, 1117, 35403). In children, taking B. lactis altered immune cell phenotypes (110995). However, in older individuals in care homes, a combination of B. lactis BB-12 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for up to 12 months had no effect on blood count, immune cell phenotypes, immune mediator concentrations, or phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. There was also no effect on the response to most vaccinations, although there was an increased response to the seasonal influenza vaccine (107519)."

            "Overview": "The genus Bifidobacterium are a group of lactic acid- and acetic acid-producing bacteria that are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract (1137, 92267). Bifidobacterium bifidum is typically found in the feces of breastfed infants (161, 107578). B. bifidum and other bifidobacteria are included in probiotic supplements (1060, 1137, 92267). Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using B. bifidum or other species of Bifidobacterium for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, B. bifidum is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Bifidobacterium bifidum has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in clinical trials lasting up to one year (1731, 12775, 14338, 92255, 107580, 110972, 110974, 110978).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of non-viable, heat-killed B. bifidum formulations when used orally.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Bifidobacterium bifidum has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in clinical trials in infants and children for up to 18 months (161, 90286, 90602, 98736, 103436, 110971, 110976, 110924). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of B. bifidum in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when Bifidobacterium bifidum is used orally and appropriately, short-term. A combination of B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus casei has been used with apparent safety for 6 weeks starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation (95416, 98430).\nLACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Bifidobacterium bifidum during lactation. However, there are currently no reasons to expect safety concerns when used appropriately.",

One case of vomiting and fever has been reported in a clinical study for a single child taking B. bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. It is unclear if the probiotics were the causal agent (90286).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere have been cases of Bifidobacterium sepsis in critically ill patients (102416, 107599). However, these cases are rare and none seem to be due to Bifidobacterium bifidum.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of IBS.\nClinical research shows that taking live or heat-inactivated B. bifidum MIMBb75 is beneficial for improving gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS (105155, 105160). Taking 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 4 weeks results in an overall responder rate of 57%, compared with 21% in the placebo group. There were specific improvements in abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency (105160). When taking the heat-inactivated form of B. bifidum MIMBb75 (SYN-HI-001) 1 billion cells daily for 8 weeks, 34% of patients experienced at least a 30% improvement in abdominal pain and overall relief of symptoms in at least 4 of the 8 weeks, compared with only 19% of those taking placebo (105155).\n\nA clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking a specific combination product (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing B. bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Most clinical research shows that taking Bifidobacterium bifidum may reduce the risk of respiratory infections in otherwise healthy individuals.\nOne clinical study shows that taking B. bifidum R0071 3 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks decreases the percentage of college students who experience at least one day of cold or flu by about 35% when compared with placebo. The number of cold or flu episodes is also decreased by 32% when compared with placebo (90272).\n\nSome studies have evaluated probiotics containing B. bifidum along with other species. One study shows that taking a specific combination (Infloran) of B. bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 billion CFUs each twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of school-aged children who experience cold-related fever, cough, or school absence when compared with placebo (90286). In healthy children aged 3-10 years, clinical research shows that taking 12.5 billion CFUs daily of a specific combination of B. bifidum CUL20, L. acidophilus CUL21 and CUL60, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (Lab4) plus vitamin C 50 mg daily reduces the risk of cough by 16% and sore throat by 20% and modestly reduces school absenteeism and antibiotic use when compared with placebo. However, nasal symptoms, fever, and wheezing were not reduced (106943).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in healthy adults over 65 years shows that taking a total of one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. bifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacterium longum BORI daily for 12 weeks modestly improves mental flexibility when compared with placebo. However, there were no benefits on cognitive function, including language, memory, or attention (110968).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with seasonal allergies shows that taking B. bifidum G9-1 0.15 billion colony-forming units CFUs), Bifidobacterium longum MM-2 0.15 billion CFUs, and Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13 1.2 billion CFUs twice daily for 8 weeks during allergy season modestly improves quality of life, specifically nasal symptoms, when compared with taking placebo. However, eye symptoms were not improved (110972).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial shows that taking a total of 60 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. bifidum CUL20 NCIMB 30153, Bifidobacterium lactis CUL 34 NCIMB 30172, and Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 NCIMB 30157 and CUL 21 NCIMB 30156 daily for 21 days does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with placebo (92255). An additional large clinical trial in children aged 3 months and up shows that taking B. bifidum in combination with other probiotics does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, when the more stringent definition is considered excluding diarrhea of other etiologies. However, the risk of diarrhea of any etiology is reduced by 35%. The probiotic supplement provided a total of 10 billion CFUs of B. bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24 daily from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after treatment ended (110969). A meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults shows that taking B. bifidum in combination with up to 8 other probiotic strains does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with placebo (107635).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis during pregnancy, from approximately 35 weeks' gestation until birth, and then giving this same combination to the infant after birth until 6 months of age, does not reduce the incidence of eczema at age 2 years, although it does appear to reduce the risk of atopic sensitization by 57% when compared with placebo (90234).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for bacterial vaginosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nCommon cold. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking B. bifidum, in combination with other probiotics and vitamins/minerals, daily for at least 3 months reduces the duration of common cold episodes by approximately 2 days when compared with taking a placebo providing only the vitamins/minerals. However, there was no difference in the number of common cold episodes. The probiotic supplement provided B. bifidum MF 20/5 5 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium longum SP 07/3 5 million CFUs, and Lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8 40 million CFUs (Tribion Harmonis) daily (110978).\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for constipation.\nClinical research shows that taking B. bifidum CCFM16 (Jiangsu WECARE-Probiotics Biotechnology Co., Ltd) 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 28 days does not improve patient-described symptoms of constipation or increase the number of weekly spontaneous bowel movements when compared with placebo. However, 42% of patients taking B. bifidum had at least 3 spontaneous bowel movements weekly, compared with 12% of those taking placebo. Stool consistency was also improved (107579). B. bifidum has also been investigated in combination with other probiotics and ingredients in clinical research in adults with chronic constipation. One study shows that taking B. bifidum in combination with Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subsp. infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (Hexbio) as 30 billion CFUs twice daily for 7 days increases the number of weekly bowel movements by about 2 when compared with placebo (90266). Another study shows that taking B. bifidum UABb-10 300 million CFUs daily for 4 weeks in combination with Bifidobacterium longum UABl-14 300 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis UABla-12 7.8 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 6.6 billion CFUs, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) 7 mg does not improve symptoms of constipation when compared with a placebo providing FOS (110970).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for dental plaque.\nA small clinical study in children ages 8-10 years shows that eating 110 grams of probiotic fruit yogurt (Activia Çilekli Meyveli, Danone) containing B. bifidum DN-173 010 1.1 trillion colony-forming units daily for 2 weeks does not reduce dental plaque when compared with a placebo fruit yogurt (102410). This study was limited by small size and the use of a sweet yogurt, which might increase dental plaque.\nless\nDepression. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with major depression shows that taking Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of depression measured on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) when compared with placebo (99780). However, the validity of the results from this study is limited by incomplete reporting. For example, patient baseline BDI scores were not reported.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for diabetes.\nClinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking freeze-dried B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus casei, each as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram daily for 6 weeks, decreases fasting plasma glucose levels by 5-9 mg/dL and reduces insulin resistance and insulin levels when compared with placebo (95416, 98430). In contrast, a large clinical trial shows that taking B. bifidum sp9 cs at least 6 billion CFUs, L. acidophilus LA1 at least 7.5 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium longum sp54 cs at least 1.5 billion CFUs daily from 14-24 weeks' gestation does not reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with taking placebo (107520).\n\nLimited evidence has also assessed the effects of B. bifidum for type 2 diabetes. A small clinical trial in patients taking metformin shows that taking B. bifidum G9-1 (Biofermin) 72 mg three times daily for 10 weeks modestly improves symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when compared with baseline. However, there was no effect on levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (110975). A small clinical study shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 12 weeks does not reduce levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin when compared with placebo (107521).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with diabetic nephropathy who are not taking antidiabetes drugs shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the ratio of microalbuminuria/creatinine (mAlb/Cr), a marker of kidney damage, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (107521).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for diarrhea.\nThe European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, B. bifidum is not a specific focus of the guidelines and most evidence on the use of this species is low quality.\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for preventing exercise-induced respiratory infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this use.\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral B. bifidum is beneficial for familial hypercholesterolemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 6-18 years of age with high cholesterol shows that taking a probiotic containing B. bifidum MB 109, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis MB 2409, and Bifidobacterium longum BL04 daily for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by 2% to 3% and increases HDL cholesterol levels by about 2% when compared with placebo. However, these changes might not be considered clinically significant (98736).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with GAD shows that taking sertraline 25 mg plus probiotics daily for 8 weeks may modestly reduce some symptoms of anxiety when compared with sertraline alone. However, the reduction in anxiety score was small and change was not consistent between rating scales. Also, the quality of life was not improved. The probiotics provided a total of 18 billion colony-forming units of B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (110977).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne preliminary clinical trial in children with symptomatic H. pylori infection shows that taking a combination probiotic containing B. bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus daily for 6 weeks, in conjunction with triple therapy, increases the H. pylori eradication rate by an additional 19% when compared with triple therapy alone (90602). However, other individual clinical trials have shown that taking B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus faecium may not improve eradication rates when taken with triple therapy consisting of furazolidone, tetracycline, and lansoprazole (90279).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research generally show that giving various bifidobacteria species alone does NOT reduce the risk of NEC or all-cause mortality (95344, 95351, 103437, 105164). However, giving bifidobacteria in combination with lactobacilli or Enterococcus faecalis to preterm infants appears to reduce the risk of NEC and giving bifidobacteria with a prebiotic appears to reduce the risk of mortality (3162, 90252, 95351, 102419, 103437, 103448, 104157, 105162, 105164). The effects of B. bifidum, specifically, are unclear. Also, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, B. bifidum is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children with NAFLD, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination (Prokid, Gostaresh Milad Pouya Company) of B. bifidum ATCC SD6576 2 billion colon-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC B3208 3 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus DSMZ 21690 2 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 32269 6 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks normalizes liver sonography findings in 53% of children, compared with 17% of those taking placebo. In addition, levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase decreased by 30% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect on body mass index or blood lipids when compared with placebo (105156). However, a small clinical trial in adults shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum BMCM 02290, Bifidobacterium longum BCMC 02129, B. longum BCMC 02120, Lactobacillus acidophilus BCMC 12,130, Lacticaseibacillus casei BCMC 12,313, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BCMC 12,451 as 30 billion CFUs twice daily for 6 months has no beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis or fibrosis, liver enzyme levels, blood lipids, or fasting blood glucose levels when compared with placebo (107523).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for NASH, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nObesity. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking 50 billion CFUs of a specific combination of B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lab4P) for 24 weeks reduces body weight by an additional 1.3 kg more than placebo (103439).\nless\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for oropharyngeal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nPharyngitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium bifidum for pharyngitis prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. bifidum for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with PCOS, clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum T1 (IBRC-M10771), Lactobacillus acidophilus T16 (IBRC-M10785), and Lacticaseibacillus casei T2 (IBRC-M10783) 2 billion colony-forming units each, plus inulin 800 mg, daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum insulin and triglyceride levels and improves insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo. There was no effect on levels of cholesterol or fasting glucose (105159). Another clinical trial shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking B. bifidum in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided B. bifidum UBBB-55, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, and Limosilactobacillus fermentum UBLF-31, one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Limosilactobacillus reuteri UBLRu-87, 2 billion CFUs each, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) 100 mg daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974).\nless\nPostoperative infection. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for preventing postoperative infection.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery shows that taking B. bifidum does not prevent surgical site or other infection or leakage when compared with taking no additional treatment. All patients received a single intravenous dose of antibiotics before surgery. B. bifidum (Biofermin) provided 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 7 days before surgery and for 10 days after surgery starting on postoperative day 5 (110982).\nless\nPouchitis. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Trilac, Allergon AB) containing B. bifidum 600 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus 600 million CFUs, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 400 million CFUs per capsule, taken in doses of 2 capsules three times daily for 9 months, can reduce pouchitis severity and the number of patients experiencing pouchitis when compared to baseline (90296).The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for growth and development of premature infants.\nClinical research in very low birthweight premature infants shows that taking B. bifidum OLB6378 2.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) in two divided doses daily until body weight reached 2000 grams or 4.4 pounds reduces the time to established enteral feeding by 1.1 days when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on other outcomes, including growth, length of hospital stay, mortality, or morbidities (110971).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral B. bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with psoriasis shows that taking a mixture of probiotics for 8 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and feelings of depression when compared with placebo. The percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% or 75% reduction in overall symptom score was 40% and 24%, respectively, in those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 16% and 8% of those taking placebo. Each probiotic capsule was used twice daily and provided a total daily dose of 2.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Bifidobacteruim longum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (107498).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin shows that taking B. bifidum (Infloran) and Lactobacillus acidophilus as 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each twice daily, from seven days before starting radiotherapy and continuing during radiotherapy, reduces the incidence of moderate to severe diarrhea and the need for antidiarrheal medication when compared with placebo. Moderate to severe diarrhea occurred in 9% of patients taking probiotics, compared with 45% of those taking placebo (107580).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with moderate-to-severe RA shows that taking capsules containing freeze-dried strains of B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus casei daily for 8 weeks does not reduce RA severity, the number of tender or swollen joints, or joint pain when compared with placebo (95418).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking a fermented milk (Yakult, Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.) containing B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as an adjunct to standard maintenance therapy might help prevent relapse in ulcerative colitis patients when compared with a control group (12775, 14338). Preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate to severe symptoms taking mesalazine 1200 mg daily shows that taking an unknown dose of B. bifidum BGN4 twice daily along with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Ligilactobacillus salivarius (Acronelle, Bromatech srl, Milan, Italy) for 2 years modestly improves patient- and physician-scales of overall symptoms when compared with taking mesalazine alone. There were also improvements in stool frequency and rectal bleeding (110981).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral Bifidobacterium bifidum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children aged 4 months to 5 years with a previous UTI, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination (Complete Probiotic Platinum) of B. bifidum 200 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 750 million CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus 750 million CFUs, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 50 million CFUs per kg twice daily for 18 months increases the median time to the first incidence of recurrence by approximately 3 months and increases the percentage of children without a UTI during the study period from 83% to 97% when compared with placebo (103436).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium bifidum is beneficial for preventing C. difficile infection.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery shows that taking B. bifidum does not prevent C. difficile infection when compared with taking no additional treatment. All patients received a single intravenous dose of antibiotics before surgery. B. bifidum (Biofermin) provided 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 7 days before surgery and for 10 days after surgery starting on postoperative day 5 (110982). B. bifidum has also been investigated in combination with other probiotics. A large clinical study in hospitalized adults aged 65 years or older shows that taking a combination of B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as 60 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 21 days does not reduce the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea when compared with placebo (92255). Also, taking B. bifidum and L. acidophilus is not beneficial for reducing the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea when compared with placebo (95364). However, one small clinical study shows that taking B. bifidum along with L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus as 12 billion CFUs total daily, starting 1 day after beginning antibiotic treatment, reduces the risk of C. difficile diarrhea by about 72% in adult inpatients (95364).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Bifidobacterium bifidum for these uses.",

Although this has not occurred specifically with B. bifidum, there have been rare cases involving other probiotic species. Pathogenic colonization seems to be more likely to occur in severely immunocompromised patients (4380, 4391, 4393, 4398, 102416).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Bifidobacterium bifidum.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Bifidobacterium bifidum is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of B. bifidum may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605, 110978). For continued effect, B. bifidum must be used regularly.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBifidobacteria are anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-positive, lactic acid- and acetic acid-producing bacteria that normally colonize in the human colon (1060, 1137, 92267). Bifidobacterium bifidum is predominantly found in the intestinal flora of breastfed infants (161, 107578).\n\nMost researchers agree that the effectiveness of B. bifidum and other probiotics for all indications depends on their ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAntibacterial effects\nBifidobacteria appear to be the most important organisms in the intestine for providing a microbial barrier to infection. When used orally, some species of bifidobacteria pass through the gut and bind to the intestinal mucosa, preventing attachment of pathogenic coliform bacteria (1137, 1731, 16847). Some bifidobacteria produce antimicrobial substances that have activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (1060, 12774, 35433). In vitro, Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 inhibits the adhesion of the enteropathogens Escherichia coli and Cronobacter sakazakii (107578). Both live and heat-inactivated B. bifidum adhere to human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro (105155).\nImmune effects\nProbiotics might have immunomodulating effects (1137, 6099). Bifidobacterium bifidum is thought to activate host immunity by a mechanism at least partially related to its cell surface glucans and galactans (107578)."

            "Overview": "Bifidobacteria are a type of lactic acid- and acetic acid-producing bacteria that are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract (1137, 92267). B. breve is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of breastfed infants and also in the vagina (107595). B. breve and other bifidobacteria are included in probiotic supplements (1060, 1137, 92267). Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using B. breve or other species of Bifidobacterium for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, B. breve is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Bifidobacterium breve has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in clinical trials lasting up to one year (3261, 6087, 11379, 12769, 12775, 14338, 14370, 14371, 103447, 111002)(111003, 111005).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Bifidobacterium breve has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in infants and children for up to 12 months (17726, 35377, 92256, 103449, 105150, 105151, 107497, 107598, 111001)(111004, 111008, 111015). Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in children (107597). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of B. breve in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given B. breve or other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Bifidobacterium breve during pregnancy or lactation. However, there are currently no reasons to expect safety concerns when used appropriately.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Bifidobacterium breve seems to be well tolerated by most patients.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that B. breve may cause bacteremia in certain patients.\nGastrointestinal\nBloating and flatulence have been reported with probiotic use; however, these adverse effects have not been reported from ingestion of Bifidobacterium breve in particular.\nless\nImmunologic\nThere have been rare cases of Bifidobacterium bacteremia related to probiotic use in critically ill infants and adults (102416, 107597, 107599). In addition, cases of B. breve bacteremia have occurred in preterm infants or young children using probiotics (102416, 107597). In a review of 298 term and preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital in Japan and received B. breve BBG-01 over a five-year period, bacteremia occurred in six patients (2%). Concomitant conditions included gastrointestinal perforation, food-induced enterocolitis syndrome, adhesive ileus, ileal volvulus, and aspiration pneumonia following esophageal atresia repair (107597). In one case report, B. breve BBG-01 was provided to an infant starting two days after birth and the day of surgery for an omphalocele. The infant also had bilious gastric fluid with elevated inflammatory markers. It is thought that the intestinal surgical repair might have led to the translocation of the ingested B. breve (107596).\n\nSome cases of B. breve bacteremia do not seem to be directly related to probiotic use. There have been rare cases of B. breve bacteremia and necrotizing fasciitis in patients with type 2 diabetes. One patient had pre-existing chronic diabetic foot ulcers and the other had abscesses near the groin (111007, 111011). A childhood history of frequent consumption of fermented beverages containing B. breve was thought to have resulted in B. breve in the intestinal flora of one of these patients, aged 42 years (111011). However, it is unclear if consumption of an unknown quantity of B. breve more than 20 years previously would play a role in this outcome. There is also a rare case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt B. breve infection possibly related to poor oral hygiene and dentition (111014).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral Bifidobacterium breve does not seem to improve cognition in older adults.\nA small clinical study in patients over 65 years of age shows that taking a sachet (Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd) containing lyophilized powder of B. breve M-16V and B-3 and Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and M-63 as 12.5 billion colony-forming units each with water daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognition as measured on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when compared with placebo (102412). While the results of this study may have been limited by the small population size, a larger clinical study in adults ages 50-80 years with subjective memory complaints also shows that using the same product for the same duration does not improve cognition when compared with placebo (102414).\nless\nSepsis. Oral Bifidobacterium breve does not seem to prevent sepsis in preterm infants.\nOne large, well-designed clinical study in preterm infants shows that taking B. breve BBG-001 up to about 90 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in formula does not reduce the risk of sepsis when compared with placebo (92256). An additional smaller clinical trial also shows that taking B. breve M-16V 3 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the risk of sepsis (111008).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in children ages 4-17 years with allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma related to Parietaria officinalis pollen shows that taking a combination of B. breve M-16 V one billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis M-63 one billion CFUs, and B. longum subsp. longum BB536 3 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks modestly improves symptoms of rhinitis and quality of life when compared to taking placebo. There was no difference in the use of rescue medication (111001).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in hospitalized patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea shows that taking a combination of B. breve 50 million colony-forming units (CFUs) and Lacticaseibacillus casei 20 million CFUs three times daily does not reduce the average duration of diarrhea, the frequency of healing, or relapse rates, when compared with taking placebo (111006).\nless\nAsthma. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in children ages 3-14 years with asthma shows that taking a combination of B. breve B632 (DSM 24706) and Ligilactobacillus salivarius LS01 (DSM 22775) one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each twice daily for 8 weeks and then once daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the number of asthma exacerbations. The odds of having one or two asthma exacerbation was more than three fold in children taking placebo when compared with children taking probiotics. There was no effect on the duration of exacerbation or use of corticosteroids (111004).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily of a combination of B. breve M-16V and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum BB536 from about 4 weeks before the expected due date until delivery and then giving 5 billion CFUs of this combination daily to the infant for 6 months reduces the odds of developing atopic dermatitis by up to 77% before 18 months of age when compared with no probiotic (111015).\nless\nAtopic disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for preventing and treating atopic disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this use.\nCeliac disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for celiac disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this condition.\nChemotherapy-related infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for preventing chemotherapy-related infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this purpose.\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial for cognitive impairment.\nClinical research in older adults with suspected mild cognitive impairment shows that taking B. breve A1 (MCC1274) 20 billion colony-forming units daily for 16 weeks improves some measures of cognitive function, including immediate and delayed memory, as well as visual spatial ability, by moderate amounts when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on language or attention (103447). However, taking the same dose for 24 weeks does not improve most measures of cognitive function (111002).\nless\nColic. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial for colic.\nPreliminary clinical research in infants with colic shows that adding B. breve CECT7263 200 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, or a combination of B. breve with Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 as 100 million CFUs each daily, to human milk, formula, or water for 28 days reduces the time spent crying per week by approximately 160-200 minutes from baseline. Taking B. breve is at least as effective as taking simethicone 20 mg four times daily (105150). Other clinical research shows that taking B. breve B632 and BR03 100 million CFUs each daily for 3 months modestly reduces daily crying duration when compared with taking placebo (111010).\n\nB. breve has also been investigated for colic prevention. Clinical research in infants without colic at baseline shows that adding B. breve CECT7263 10 million CFUs per gram to formula modestly reduces the number of infants crying more than three hours daily when compared with a control formula. At 6 weeks of age, 12% of infants taking formula supplemented with B. breve cried more than 3 hours daily, compared with 29% of those using the control formula. At 4 months of age, frequency of crying more than 3 hours daily was low and not significantly different between groups (105151). However, this study was not specifically designed to examine the effects of B. breve on colic frequency as the infants did not have colic at baseline.\nless\nConstipation. Most early research shows that oral Bifidobacterium breve seems to be beneficial for constipation.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 3-16 years with functional constipation shows that taking a specific B. breve powder (Yakult, Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.) 1-100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 4 weeks increases defecation frequency by about 4 times per week, decreases episodes of fecal incontinence by about 7.5 episodes per week, and improves stool consistency and episodes of abdominal pain (17726).\n\nMulti-strain probiotics containing bifidobacteria have also been evaluated for constipation. In children with chronic constipation, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. breve M-16 V, Bifidobacterium longum M-63, and B. longum BB536 daily for 8 weeks in addition to polyethylene glycol (PEG), does not improve symptoms or increase the rate of clinical remission when compared with PEG alone (107600). However, one meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with functional constipation shows that taking B. breve DSM 16604 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LMG P-21021 as 5 billion CFUs total daily for 30 days improves bowel movement frequency by about 1.5 stools weekly when compared with placebo (95342). Also, a small clinical trial shows that taking a specific combination product (ID-HWS1000) containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201, L. plantarum IDCC 3501, Lacticaseibacillus casei IDCC 3451, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IDCC 4301, Bifidobacterium breve IDCC 4401, Lactococcus lactis IDCC 2301, xylooligosaccharide, and dietary fiber as nondigestible maltodextrin, oat fiber, and psyllium husk fiber modestly increases stool frequency and improves symptoms of functional constipation in adults when compared with placebo (107517).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial for depression.\nA small clinical trial in patients with major depressive disorder shows that taking B. breve CCFM1025 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 4 weeks modestly improves symptoms of depression when compared with placebo (107602).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for various forms of diabetes; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (Familact probiotics, ZistTakhmir Co.) containing B. breve and other probiotics daily for 6 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose or plasma insulin levels when compared with placebo. This product contains B. breve 30 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), B. longum 7 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus 2 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus casei 7 billion CFUs, Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus 1.5 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 200 million CFUs, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.5 billion CFUs (99790).\n\nIn adults with gestational diabetes, one clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing B. breve and various other probiotics as a total of 112.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. However, there were small improvements in insulin levels and insulin resistance (107549).\n\nA combination probiotic containing B. breve has also been evaluated in children 2-12 years of age with new-onset type 1 diabetes. One clinical study shows that taking Visbiome as 112.5 billion CFUs daily for 3 months modestly decreases HbA1c and insulin requirements when compared with placebo. Also, about three times as many children achieved remission, defined as insulin requirements of less than 0.5 U/kg daily and HbA1c levels of less than 7%. However, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected when compared with placebo (107497). It is unclear if any benefits are due to B. breve, other probiotics, or the combinations.\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing B. breve, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417). A large clinical trial in infants aged 4-6 months shows that taking an infant formula fermented with B. breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 (Calisma) for about 5 months does not affect the incidence or duration of diarrhea episodes when compared with a standard infant formula. However, there was a modest reduction in severity of diarrhea episodes, based on reductions in proportions of infants with dehydration, consultations with medical providers, and need for oral rehydration (111106). This formula did not provide live B. breve.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in resistance-trained males shows that taking B. breve BR03 and Streptococcus thermophilus FP4 as 10 billion colony-forming units total daily for 3 weeks prior to resistance training modestly attenuates range of motion decrements, but does not seem to significantly decrease overall muscle soreness, when compared with placebo (95415).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn adults with H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease, adding a combination product containing seven strains of probiotics (Balance by Protexin Co) daily for 14 days to quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth subcitrate, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin does not improve H. pylori eradication or symptoms when compared with quadruple therapy alone. This product provided B. breve, Lacticasebacillus casei, L acticasebacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus (90291).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing B. breve and other probiotics as 450 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks decreases bloating in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) (11379). However, adding this product as 900 billion CFUs daily to a sham diet or a low-FODMAP diet for 4 weeks does not improve IBS symptoms when compared with placebo (98741). Other clinical research shows that taking a different product (Duolac Care) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice daily for 4 weeks can relieve symptoms in 72% of patients with IBS (95353). In addition, a clinical study in patients with IBS-D shows that taking a specific combination probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing B. breve BB010, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, B. longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this condition.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial or safe for preventing NEC.\nOne large, well-designed clinical study in preterm infants shows that taking B. breve BBG-001 up to about 90 billion colony-forming units daily in formula does not reduce the risk of NEC when compared with placebo (92256). In a systematic review, four studies show that using B. breve does not reduce the incidence of NEC in most infants. However, in one of the included studies, although there was no effect on the incidence of NEC stage 2 in the total group or in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation, the incidence was reduced in infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation. Also, other preliminary clinical research shows that giving B. breve alone or with Lacticaseibacillus casei reduces the incidence of NEC (107592, 107595). Guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, B. breve is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with NAFLD shows that taking two sachets daily for 3 months of a specific combination product (VSL#3) containing B. breve and other probiotics does not affect body mass index or most glycemic or lipid parameters when compared with taking placebo. However, there was a modest decrease in triglyceride levels and liver enzymes (111009).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial for obesity.\nClinical research in children aged 6-18 years with obesity and insulin resistance shows that adding B. breve BR03 (DSM 16604) and B632 (DSM 24706) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each daily for 8 weeks to advice on the Mediterranean diet and exercise modestly improves insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo. However, there was no difference between groups in body mass index (BMI) or blood pressure when compared with diet and exercise advice alone (107598). Additional clinical research in overweight, but non-obese, adults based on BMI shows that taking B. breve B-3 5 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body fat mass and waist and hip circumference when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on body fat percentage or lipid endpoints (111003).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for improving postoperative recovery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this purpose.\nPouchitis. Oral Bifidobacterium breve has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that continuous treatment with a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing B. breve and other probiotics as 6 grams (300-500 billion live bacteria per gram) daily for up to a year seems to maintain remission of pouchitis in 85% of patients (6087, 12769).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for preventing radiation-induced diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this purpose.\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for preventing respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this purpose.\nRotaviral diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for rotaviral diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this condition.\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium breve is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nSome clinical research has evaluated B. breve-containing probiotics for increasing remission rates in patients with ulcerative colitis. The best evidence is for a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma). Doses of 3 grams (equivalent to 900 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) once or twice daily has been used in combination with conventional treatment. In children aged 1-16 years, doses of 450-1800 billion CFUs for up to one year have been used (3261, 14370, 14371, 16841, 95337). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking this probiotic can increase remission rates by about 1.7-fold when compared with placebo in adults and children with active ulcerative colitis (95337). There is also evidence that it is beneficial for improving remission rates in patients who do not adequately respond to conventional treatment (14371). Additionally, some preliminary clinical research shows that this specific product, taken as an adjunct to standard maintenance therapy, might help prevent relapse (3261, 16841).\n\nOther preliminary clinical research shows that taking Visbiome or a fermented milk (Yakult, Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.) containing B. breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as an adjunct to standard maintenance therapy might help prevent relapse in ulcerative colitis patients (3261, 12775, 14338, 16841). However, other research shows that taking B. breve Yakult is not beneficial for preventing ulcerative colitis relapse (98740).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium breve for C. difficile infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. breve for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate Bifidobacterium breve for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn clinical research, Bifidobacterium breve supplements are often given as capsules or as a powder mixed with food or formula. Supplements used orally in clinical trials have contained B. breve alone or in combination with other species of probiotics or other ingredients.\n\nA specific combination probiotic (previously marketed as VSL#3, now sold as Visbiome by ExeGi Pharma) used in various clinical studies contains viable lyophilized bacteria species including Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM24735, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DSM24730, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM24733, Lactobacillus helveticus DSM24734, Bifidobacterium breve DSM24732, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSM24736 and DSM24737, and Streptococcus thermophilus DSM24731 (3261, 6087, 11379, 12769, 14370, 14371, 16841). Another specific combination probiotic (marketed as VSL#3 in various countries and manufactured by VSL Pharmaceuticals Inc.) provides L. acidophilus BA05, L. plantarum BP06, L. paracasei BP07, L. helveticus BD08, B. breve BB02, B. animalis subsp. lactis BL03 and BI04, and S. thermophilus BT01 (111009).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nIMMUNODEFICIENCY\nTheoretically, Bifidobacterium breve preparations might cause pathogenic colonization in patients who are severely immunocompromised; use with caution in these patients. There have been rare cases of Bifidobacterium bacteremia in critically ill infant and adult patients. Cases of B. breve bacteremia have occurred in infants and children using probiotics containing B. breve (102416). Pathogenic colonization seems to be more likely to occur in severely immunocompromised patients (4380, 4391, 4393, 4398, 102416, 107597, 107599).\nless\nINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION\nTheoretically, there is a risk of bacteremia in infants at risk of intestinal obstruction following abdominal surgery; use with caution in these infants. Two cases of bacteremia in premature infants given Bifidobacterium breve have been reported. In both cases, the infants had undergone abdominal surgery. It is speculated that bacteremia resulted from intestinal obstructions caused by postoperative adhesions. In one of the cases, resuming oral intake of B. breve after restoration of intestinal peristalsis did not result in bacteremia recurrence (95355).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Bifidobacterium breve.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Bifidobacterium breve is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of B. breve may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605). For continued effect, B. breve must be used regularly.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBifidobacteria are anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-positive bacteria that normally colonize in the human colon (1060, 1137). Bifidobacteria belong to a group of bacteria called lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are also found in fermented foods like yogurt and cheese (1055, 3589). Bifidobacterium breve is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of breastfed infants and in the vagina (107595).\n\nMost researchers agree that the effectiveness of B. breve and other probiotics for all indications depends on their ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAntibacterial effects\nBifidobacteria appear to be the most important organisms in the intestine for providing a microbial barrier to infection. When used orally, some species of bifidobacteria pass through the gut and bind to the intestinal mucosa, preventing attachment of pathogenic coliform bacteria (1137, 1731, 16847). Some bifidobacteria produce antimicrobial substances that have activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (1060, 12774, 35433). One strain of Bifidobacterium breve (Yakult; BBG-01) has been shown to reduce the counts of the pathogenic organisms Campylobacter, Candida, and Enterococcus, and prevents Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O157:H7 infections in animal models (107595).\nAntidepressant effects\nBifidobacterium breve is of interest for depression and has shown antidepressant effects in human research. These effects may be related to changes in tryptophan metabolism. B. breve has been shown to reduce the turnover of serotonin. However, B. breve had no effect on levels of serum cortisol or inflammatory cytokines in one clinical study (107602).\nAntipouchitis effects\nProbiotics including bifidobacteria are being used for pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Some evidence suggests that patients who develop pouchitis have a low number of bacteria, but a high number of fungal flora in the mucosa of the pouch. Treatment with a specific combination probiotic containing B. breve and seven other probiotic species (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) seems to decrease fungal flora and increase bacterial flora, including modification towards more anaerobic flora (14376).\nAntiviral effects\nBifidobacterium breve is of interest for its antiviral effects. In an animal model, B. breve YIT4064 increased levels of anti-influenza virus IgG in serum and stimulated anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin IgA by Peyer's patch cells (107595).\nImmune effects\nProbiotics might have immunomodulating effects (1137, 6099). Laboratory research has found that some strains of Bifidobacterium breve contain an exopolysaccharide on the cell surface which can modulate B-cell response and reduce pathogen colonization by producing biofilm on the gut epithelium (107595). In an animal model of asthma, B. breve MRx0004 reduced infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. There was also a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in neutrophil migration (107595). Also, in an animal model, B. breve Yakult increased IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells in the large intestine and the production of acetic acid (107595). Anti-allergy effects have also been found in animal models. B. breve M-16V has been found to reduce levels of IgE and IgG1 (107595).\nNeurological effects\nB. breve is of interest for cognitive improvement. In animal models, Bifidobacterium breve reduced compulsive and anxious behaviors, and prevented cognitive decline (107595)."

Two subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum, are found in the gastrointestinal tract and are included in some probiotic supplements (1060, 1137, 92267). Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using B. longum or other species of Bifidobacterium for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, B. longum is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).\n\nVisbiome/VSL#3: Two specific combination probiotics were previously studied and marketed as containing B. longum (Visbiome by ExeGi Pharma, previously marketed as VSL#3 and another product marketed as VSL#3 in various countries and manufactured by VSL Pharmaceuticals Inc.). However, these products contain other viable lyophilized bacteria species including Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium breve, and two subspecies of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (3261, 6087, 11379, 12769, 14370, 14371, 14376, 16841, 95337, 98741)(107497, 107549, 111009).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Bifidobacterium longum has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in clinical trials lasting up to one year (1233, 12108, 13054, 14334, 35382, 35403, 35424, 103440, 103446, 105129)( 107593,110968,110972,111773,111776,111847,111851,111854,111857,111858).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Bifidobacterium longum has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in infants and children for up to 4 months (3162, 35377, 35383, 35393, 35406, 35407, 92266, 98736, 107531, 110924)(110976, 111001, 111015, 111825, 111833, 111848). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of B. longum in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given these and other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. A combination of Bifidobacterium longum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has been used with apparent safety throughout pregnancy (105128, 105144). A combination of B. longum BB536 and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V has been used with apparent safety from about 4 weeks before the expected due date until delivery (111015). Also, a combination of B. longum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has been used with apparent safety from 2 months prior to delivery until 2 months after delivery during lactation (90285).",

Flatulence has been reported rarely with Bifidobacterium longum when used alone or in combination with other species of probiotics (107520, 111773). Other rare gastrointestinal side effects have included constipation and gastrointestinal motor disorder (111773).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere have been rare cases of Bifidobacterium bacteremia in critically ill infant and adult patients (102416, 107599). Various cases of Bifidobacterium longum bacteremia, sometimes presenting as sepsis, have occurred in preterm infants using probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111850, 111852, 111853). In one case report, a 15-month-old female infant with congenital heart defects and recent surgery to replace a mechanical heart valve developed Bifidobacterium sepsis after being treated with IV antibiotics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and oral probiotics containing B. longum. It was thought that ECMO contributed to translocation of bifidobacteria from the gut and into the blood (102416). In 5 cases, very-low birthweight preterm infants developed B. longum bacteremia following the use of a specific probiotic product providing B. longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus (Infloran) for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis; antibiotic treatment was required in at least some of the cases (111850, 111852, 111853). Cases of sepsis related to B. longum have also occurred in adults; however, association with supplementation is unlikely. In one case, sepsis with B. longum occurred following acupuncture. This was likely due to needle contamination and not to supplementation (1236). In another case, a 71-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and prostate cancer developed B. longum lumbar vertebrodiscitis. The source was thought to be translocation from the intestine (111859). A 42-year-old male developed B. longum peritonitis secondary to intestinal perforation (111855).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen taken orally, a dry cough has been reported by a single patient in a clinical trial (111851).\nless\nOther\nWhen taken orally, weight gain has been reported by a single patient in a clinical trial (111773).\nless",

It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for abdominal pain or discomfort.\nClinical research in adults with abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating shows that taking B. longum 35624 (Align) one billion colony-forming units daily for 4 weeks does not reduce symptom severity or the frequency of pain and discomfort when compared with placebo. However, there was a 72% increased odds of having at least one day free of abdominal bloating or distension. Individuals in this study had not been seeing a physician but had symptoms at least twice a week for 3 months (111858).\nless\nAcute radiation syndrome. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for acute radiation syndrome.\nA small clinical study shows that antibiotic-resistant B. longum can help improve short-term survival in the treatment of radiation sickness. In combination with prophylactic antibiotics, B. longum appears to inhibit colonization and overgrowth of intestinal opportunistic pathogens, preventing post-irradiation sepsis. This study used B. longum 10 billion colony-forming units daily in 10 mL of milk for 30 days, starting approximately 10 days after irradiation (3457).\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients over 65 years of age shows that taking a sachet (Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd) containing lyophilized powder of B. longum BB536 and M-63, along with B. breve M-16V and B-3 as 12.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each with water daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognition as measured on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when compared with placebo (102412). While the results of this study may have been limited by the small population size, a larger clinical study in adults ages 50-80 years with subjective memory complaints also shows that using the same product for the same duration does not improve cognition when compared with placebo (102414). Additional clinical research in healthy adults over 65 years shows that taking a total of one billion CFUs of B. longum BORI and Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 daily for 12 weeks modestly improves mental flexibility when compared with placebo. However, there were no benefits on cognitive function, including language, memory, or attention (110968).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever).

However, eye symptoms were not improved (110972). Also, a small clinical trial in children ages 4-17 years with allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma related to Parietaria officinalis pollen shows that taking a combination of B. longum BB536 3 billion CFUs, B. longum M-63 1 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium breve M-16 V 1 billion CFUs, daily for 8 weeks modestly improves symptoms of rhinitis and quality of life when compared to taking placebo. There was no difference in the use of rescue medication (111001).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD); the available research is conflicting.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking B. longum can reduce stool frequency, abdominal discomfort, and stool clostridial spore count when used in patients concurrently taking erythromycin (1233). However, other research shows that taking B. longum with clindamycin does not significantly reduce diarrhea (14334). A small clinical trial in children aged 5 months to 16 years shows that taking a combination of B. longum PL03, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus KL53A, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PL02 twice daily during antibiotic treatment does not reduce the rate of AAD when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in the number of stools each day (107553).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for asthma.\nClinical research in patients with asthma shows that taking B. longum 35624 (Alimentary Health Ltd) one billion colony-forming units twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce asthma severity or inhaler use or improve pulmonary function when compared with taking placebo. However, in a small sub-set of patients with uncontrolled symptoms, well-controlled asthma occurred in 93% of patients taking B. longum compared with 36% of those taking placebo. This benefit was maintained for an additional 4 weeks in 57% of patients. Some measures of pulmonary function were improved (111856).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for athletic performance.\nIn athletes, preliminary clinical research shows that taking B. longum OLP-01 15 billion colony-forming units in three divided doses daily for 5 weeks with training and de-training does not affect the distance run in 12 minutes when compared with placebo (103446).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema).

One clinical study shows that taking a combination of B. longum plus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus or Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, beginning about 2 months before expected delivery and continuing through breastfeeding until the infant is 2 months old, reduces the risk of eczema in the infant (90285). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily of a combination of B. longum BB536 and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V from about 4 weeks before the expected due date until delivery and then giving 5 billion CFUs of this combination daily to the infant for 6 months reduces the odds of developing atopic dermatitis by up to 77% before 18 months of age when compared with no probiotic (111015). In addition, in children ages 4-17 years, taking 1 billion CFUs of a 1:1:1 combination of B. longum CECT 7347, Lacticaseibacillus casei CECT 9104, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145 for 12 weeks modestly reduces symptom severity and the need for topical corticosteroids when compared with placebo (107531). However, in infants with a family history of allergic disease, giving human milk containing B. longum BL999 10 million CFUs and L. rhamnosus 20 million CFUs daily for the first 6 months of life does not seem to reduce the incidence of eczema or atopic sensitization (35396).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne large observational study in premature infants suggests that taking B. longum 1-1.5 billion colony-forming units with L. acidophilus during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis is not associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium longum for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this condition.\nCeliac disease. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for celiac disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 2-17 years with celiac disease shows that taking B. longum CECT 7347 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily along with a gluten-free diet for 3 months does not improve gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or vomiting, when compared with placebo (92266). Also, a small clinical trial in adults with persistent symptoms of celiac disease while following a gluten-free diet shows that taking B. longum NLS-SS (Natren Life Start 2, Natren Inc., USA) 4 billion CFUs three times daily for 3 weeks does not reduce symptoms when compared with taking placebo. However, there was a modest benefit in patients with the greatest initial clinical burden (111857). This study might have been too small to detect differences between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-related infection. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with leukemia receiving chemotherapy shows that taking B. longum in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus (Morinaga Bifidus), with or without Enterococcus faecalis (Levenin), does not reduce the risk of Candida infection when compared to control (35434).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults ages 60-75 years without cognitive impairment shows that taking B. longum BB68S 50 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 8 weeks modestly improves cognitive function, including immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial/constructional memory, and attention, when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on language or some other measures (111776). A small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking a product containing a combination of B. longum R0175 70 million CFUs, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 2 billion CFUs, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum R1012 800 million CFUs (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare, Milano, Italy) daily for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo. The probiotics were provided in combination with inulin 500 mg, potassium 50 mg, magnesium 45 mg, glutathione 20 mg, lactoferrin 10 mg, and zinc 9 mg (110923). The effects of B. longum alone are not clear from this study. Also, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm these results.\nless\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral B. longum for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this condition.\nCommon cold. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking B. longum, in combination with other probiotics and vitamins/minerals, daily for at least 3 months reduces the duration of common cold episodes by approximately 2 days when compared with taking a placebo providing only the vitamins/minerals. However, there was no difference in the number of common cold episodes. The probiotic supplement provided B. longum SP 07/3 5 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5 5 million CFUs, and Lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8 40 million CFUs (Tribion Harmonis) daily (110978).\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for constipation.\nB. longum BB536 in doses of 2-20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) has been evaluated for constipation in adults, but results are conflicting and modest at best (35413, 35424). Multi-strain probiotics containing B. longum have also been evaluated. Clinical research in adults with chronic constipation shows that taking a multi-strain probiotic (Hexbio) containing B. longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 30 billion CFUs twice daily for 7 days increases the number of weekly bowel movements by about 2 when compared with placebo (90266). However, another study shows that taking B. bifidum UABb-10 300 million CFUs daily for 4 weeks in combination with Bifidobacterium longum UABl-14 300 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis UABla-12 7.8 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 6.6 billion CFUs, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) 7 mg does not improve symptoms of constipation when compared with a placebo providing FOS (110970).\n\nAlso, in children with chronic constipation, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of B. longum M-63, B. longum BB536, and B. breve M-16 V daily for 8 weeks in addition to polyethylene glycol (PEG) does not improve symptoms or increase the rate of clinical remission when compared with PEG alone (107600).\n\nB. longum has also been investigated for constipation prevention in infants. Clinical research in healthy term infants less than 3 months of age shows that consuming infant formula without B. longum for 12 weeks results in a 5.2-fold increased odds of having constipation when compared with consuming a formula supplemented with B. longum CECT7210 10 million CFUs per gram (111825).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, retrospective study in patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms shows that taking a combination of probiotics in three divided doses daily modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea when compared to standard treatments alone. The probiotic treatment consisted of B. longum 60 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Streptococcus thermophilus 6 million CFUs, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 6 million CFUs, given in three divided doses daily (107200).\nless\nDepression. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of major depressive disorder shows that taking a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. longum and Lactobacillus helveticus daily modestly improves symptoms of depression when compared with placebo, but not when compared with the prebiotic galactooligosaccharide. All patients had been taking antidepressants for at least 3 months (102506). Also, preliminary clinical research in treatment-naïve patients with moderate depression shows that taking 0.3 billion CFUs of B. longum in combination with 2.7 billion CFUs of L. helveticus daily modestly improves symptoms of depression and sleep quality when compared with baseline (105129). However, a larger clinical trial in untreated patients with depression shows that taking a total of 3 billion CFUs of B. longum and L. helveticus does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo. The majority of these patients had a history of prior antidepressant usage (110922). All studies used B. longum R0175 and L. helveticus R0052 (Lallemand Health Solutions Inc.) daily for 8 weeks.\nless\nDiabetes. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (Familact probiotics, ZistTakhmir Co.) containing B. longum and other probiotic bacteria daily for 6 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose or plasma insulin levels when compared with placebo. This product contains B. longum 7 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium breve 30 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus acidophilus 2 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus casei 7 billion CFUs, Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus 1.5 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 200 million CFUs, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.5 billion CFUs (99790). Also, a large clinical trial shows that taking B. longum sp54 cs at least 1.5 billion CFUs daily, L. acidophilus LA1 at least 7.5 billion CFUs daily, and Bifidobacterium bifidum sp9 cs at least 6 billion CFUs daily from 14-24 weeks' gestation does not reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with placebo (107520).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for diarrhea treatment or prevention.\nClinical research in healthy term infants less than 3 months of age shows that consuming infant formula supplemented with B. longum CECT7210 for 12 weeks does not reduce the overall number of diarrhea episodes or the proportion of infants with a diarrhea episode when compared with consuming control infant formula. The probiotic formula provided 10 million colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram (111825). The number of episodes of diarrhea may have been too small to detect differences between groups.\n\nB. longum has also been investigated for diarrhea treatment. A small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing B. longum, B. breve, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417). In adults with acute diarrhea, clinical research shows that taking one capsule providing at least 20 million CFUs each of B. longum and Lactobacillus gasseri (Omniflora) three times daily for up to 6 days is as effective as taking Enterococcus faecium SF 68 75 million CFUs three times daily, used as an active comparator, for reducing the duration of diarrhea. However, complete recovery occurred in a modestly greater proportion of patients. All patients also received oral rehydration solution (111854).\nless\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 6-18 years of age with high cholesterol shows that taking a probiotic containing B. longum BL04, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis MB 2409, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MB 109 daily for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by 2% to 3% and increases HDL cholesterol levels by about 2% when compared with placebo. However, these changes might not be considered clinically significant (98736).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with GAD shows that taking sertraline 25 mg plus probiotics daily for 8 weeks may modestly reduce some symptoms of anxiety when compared with sertraline alone. However, the reduction in anxiety score was small and change was not consistent between rating scales. Also, the quality of life was not improved. The probiotics provided a total of 18 billion colony-forming units of B. longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (110977).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults shows that taking combination products containing both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in conjunction with standard therapy increases the odds of H. pylori eradication by approximately 2-fold when compared with standard therapy alone. These combinations also reduce the odds of disease-related side effects by approximately 70% when compared with standard therapy alone. Six of the ten studies in the meta-analysis included B. longum, with two specifying the inclusion of two B. longum subspecies (90601).\n\nHowever, one clinical study has evaluated a combination product containing seven strains of probiotics in adults with H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. In this study, adding this specific probiotic (Balance by Protexin Co) daily for 14 days to quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth subcitrate, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin does not improve H. pylori eradication or symptoms when compared with quadruple therapy alone. This product provided B. longum, B. breve, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (90291). The lack of effect might be attributed to the shorter duration of therapy or the different composition and dose of probiotics.\nless\nHepatic encephalopathy. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking an unspecified amount of B. longum W11 in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides (Zirfos) 2.5 grams daily for 90 days modestly reduces serum ammonia levels and improves performance on various neuropsychological tests measuring abstract reasoning, memory, motor speed, language, etc., when compared with taking a placebo consisting of B vitamins (111847).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in individuals with total cholesterol of 190 mg/dL or higher shows that taking fermented milk 375 grams containing B. longum BB536 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 for 4 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with yogurt. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels seem to be reduced as well (35401).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although most research shows that taking Bifidobacterium longum in combination with other probiotics is beneficial for IBS, the effect of B. longum alone is unclear.\nSome clinical research shows that consuming B. longum (35624; Align or Bifantis) in daily doses of 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) as capsules or 1 billion CFUs as capsules or a malted milk drink for 4-8 weeks reduces overall disease severity, abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel movement difficulty, an improves quality of life in patients with IBS when compared with placebo or to baseline. These benefits seem to occur within one week of treatment (13054, 95392, 111773). However, not all research agrees. A meta-analysis of a small number of clinical studies shows that although this strain reduces overall symptom severity, taking B. longum does not increase the frequency of global responders or reduce abdominal pain when compared with placebo (107594). Also, although a meta-analysis of two studies shows that taking B. longum 35624 along with multiple other probiotics reduces abdominal pain and bloating/distension, a meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that taking B. longum 35624 alone does not improve these symptoms or bowel habit satisfaction (107593). Also, one clinical trial shows that taking B. longum R0175 10 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks does not improve symptoms of IBS when compared with placebo (103440). One clinical study shows that taking B. longum NCC3001 10 billion CFUs once daily for 6 weeks increases the percentage of patients with IBS who experience a clinically meaningful improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms by about 2-fold when compared with placebo. A clinically meaningful improvement was defined as an increase in Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale score of at least 2 points (95417).\n\nSome research has evaluated B. longum in combination with other probiotics. Clinical research shows that taking a specific product (Duolac Care) containing B. longum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice daily for 4 weeks can relieve symptoms in 72% of patients with IBS (95353). In addition, a clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking another specific combination probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing B. longum BL020, B. breve BB010, B. animalis subsp. lactis BL040, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 2.5 billion CFUs daily twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516).\nless\nJapanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for this condition.\nSome clinical research shows that taking powder containing B. longum BB536 50 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 4-13 weeks during pollen season reduces runny nose, nasal blockage, and overall symptom score when compared with placebo in patients with Japanese cedar pollen allergy (35382). However, other clinical research shows that taking this same strain daily for 13 weeks does not reduce runny nose or nasal blockage when compared with placebo (35379). There is also conflicting evidence regarding the effect of B. longum on eye symptoms, with some evidence showing no beneficial effect and other evidence suggesting reduced eye symptoms (35382, 35384). Also, B. longum BB536 does not seem to improve nasal itching, sneezing, or throat symptoms associated with Japanese cedar pollinosis (35379, 35382, 35384).\nless\nLactose intolerance. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with persistent symptoms related to lactose intolerance despite a lactose-free diet, a small clinical trial shows that taking a combination of B. longum BB536 4 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 1 billion CFUs, and vitamin B6 1.4 mg (Zircombi) daily for 30 days modestly improves symptoms of bloating and constipation, but not abdominal pain, when compared with placebo (105153).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nAlthough some research disagrees, most clinical research and meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving bifidobacteria alone does NOT reduce the risk of NEC or all-cause mortality (92256, 95344, 95351, 103437, 105164). However, giving bifidobacteria in combination with lactobacilli or Enterococcus faecalis to preterm infants appears to reduce the risk of NEC by up to 87% and giving bifidobacteria with a prebiotic appears to reduce the risk of mortality (3162, 90252, 95351, 102419, 103437, 103448, 104157, 105162, 105164). A network meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking a combination probiotic containing B. longum Bb-02, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis Bb-12, and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4, reduces the risk of NEC by 71% when compared with control (102437). Despite these findings, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, B. longum is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\n\nThe effects of B. longum specifically are unclear.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a combination product (Hexbio) containing B. longum BCMC 02129, B. longum BCMC 02120, Bifidobacterium bifidum BMCM 02290, Lactobacillus acidophilus BCMC 12,130, Lacticaseibacillus casei BCMC 12,313, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BCMC 12,451 as 30 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 6 months has no beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis or fibrosis, liver enzyme levels, blood lipids, or fasting blood glucose levels when compared with placebo (107523).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with NASH shows that taking a specific combination probiotic capsule (Lactiale, Farmak) containing B. longum, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus 100 million colony-forming units in total, with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), once daily for 12 weeks does not improve liver enzyme levels or hepatic steatosis when compared with control (102415). However, other clinical research in patients with NASH undergoing lifestyle modification shows that taking an unspecified amount of B. longum in combination with FOS (Zirfos) daily for 24 weeks modestly reduces disease activity and steatosis, as well as levels of aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, insulin resistance, and inflammatory factors when compared with placebo. There was no effect on body mass index, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, other glycometabolic indices, or other measures of liver function (111849). It is unclear whether any benefits are related to B. longum, FOS, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium longum for weight loss, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this use.\nOral mucositis. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer undergoing radiochemotherapy shows that taking a specific probiotic product (Bifico, Shanghai Sine Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) containing B. longum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecium three capsules twice daily for up to 7 weeks modestly reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with placebo (102413).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium longum for periodontitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this condition.\nPostoperative infection. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for preventing postoperative infections.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking B. longum BB536 50 billion colony-forming units daily for 7-14 days before colorectal surgery and then postoperatively for 14 days does not reduce the incidence of postoperative infections, the need for additional antibiotics, or the duration of hospital stay when compared with no intervention. However, hospital stay was reduced by 18 days in a sub-set of patients who had received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (111772).\nless\nPrematurity. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne large observational study in infants fed strictly human milk, but not strictly formula or a combination, suggests that taking B. longum 1-1.5 billion colony-forming units with L. acidophilus during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with a modest increased weight gain velocity. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with psoriasis shows that taking a mixture of probiotics for 8 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and feelings of depression when compared with placebo. The percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% or 75% reduction in overall symptom score was 40% and 24%, respectively, in those taking the probiotic, compared with 16% and 8% of those taking placebo. Each probiotic capsule provided a total daily dose of 2.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (107498).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium longum for radiation-induced diarrhea prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this condition.\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for preventing respiratory tract infections.\nOne clinical study shows that taking B. longum R0033 3 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks does not reduce the percentage of college students who experience at least one day of cold or flu or the overall number of cold or flu episodes when compared with placebo (90272). However, preliminary clinical research in children aged 2-6 years shows that taking B. longum B536, 5 billion CFUs daily on 5 days each week for 10 months, reduces the duration of sore throat by 46% and modestly decreases the frequency of respiratory illnesses when compared with placebo. There was also a nonsignificant trend toward reduced fever and runny nose duration in the treatment group; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes (98738).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne large observational study in premature infants suggests that taking L B. longum 1-1.5 billion colony-forming units with L. acidophilus during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis is not associated with a reduced risk of retinopathy of prematurity. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in hospitalized infants with rotaviral infection shows that giving a probiotic formula containing B. longum BORI and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 2 billion colony-forming units per gram twice daily for 3 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by about 1.2 days when compared with placebo; however, it does not reduce the duration of fever or the frequency of diarrhea or vomiting (95334).\nless\nSepsis. Oral Bifidobacterium longum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne large observational study in infants fed a mix of human milk and formula, but not strictly human milk or formula, suggests that taking B. longum 1-1.5 billion colony-forming units with L. acidophilus during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with a 31% reduction in the development of clinical sepsis. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral Bifidobacterium longum is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis symptoms and using stable doses of standard treatment shows that taking at least 200 billion colony-forming units B. longum 536 three times daily for 8 weeks does not increase the proportion of patients in remission or reduce symptom severity when compared with taking placebo (111851). Given the high rate of response in the group given only standard treatment, this study may have been too small to detect differences between groups.\n\nMore evidence is needed to rate Bifidobacterium longum for these uses.\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Bifidobacterium longum for C. difficile infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of B. longum for this condition.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBifidobacterium longum has most often been used alone or in combination with other probiotics in doses of up to 20 billion colony-forming units daily for up to 8 weeks.

There have been rare cases of Bifidobacterium bacteremia in critically ill infant and adult patients. At least 17 cases of B. longum bacteremia, sometimes presenting as sepsis, have occurred in preterm infants using probiotics including B. longum (102416, 111850, 111852, 111853).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Bifidobacterium longum is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of B. longum may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605, 111825, 111833, 111848, 111857). For continued effect, B. longum must be used regularly.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBifidobacteria are anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-positive, lactic acid- and acetic acid-producing bacteria that normally colonize in the human colon (1060, 1137, 92267). Two subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum, are found in the gastrointestinal tract and are included in some probiotic supplements (1060, 1137, 92267).\n\nMost researchers agree that the effectiveness of B. longum and other probiotics for all indications depends on their ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589). B. longum is particularly resistant to gastric acid (3589).\nAntibacterial effects\nBifidobacteria appear to be the most important organisms in the intestine for providing a microbial barrier to infection. When used orally, Bifidobacterium longum subspecies pass through the gut and bind to the intestinal mucosa, preventing attachment of pathogenic coliform bacteria (1137, 1731, 16847). B. longum produces antimicrobial substances that have activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (35433). Antibacterial effects have been shown in animal research against pathogenic species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35390) and Escherichia coli 0157:H7 IPH9 (35431).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that Bifidobacterium longum might help protect against cancer. In animal research, B. longum BB536 reduces the incidence of tumors (35419, 35421). Some bifidobacteria decrease fecal enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, nitroreductase, and urease, which are involved in the metabolic activation of some mutagens and carcinogens (6099).\nAntiviral effects\nBifidobacteria are commonly used for respiratory illnesses, including the influenza virus. In animal research, Bifidobacteruim longum BB536 reduces symptoms of the influenza virus, perhaps by inhibiting viral proliferation and improving levels of inflammatory cytokines (35408, 35423).\nImmune effects\nProbiotics might have immunomodulating effects (1137, 6099). Bifidobacterium longum might improve inflammatory symptoms of ulcerative colitis by improving the mucosal barrier and improving immune response (35397)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "The bilberry plant is a deciduous, leafy, freely branched, perennial shrub that is native to northern Europe, the northern United States, and Canada. It produces a fruit similar to the American blueberry. The name bilberry is derived from the Danish word bollebar, which means \"dark berry.\" The berries are purple-black in color and coarsely wrinkled. The fruit and leaf are sometimes used as medicine (1265, 16628).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts commonly found in foods. Bilberry has Generally Recognized As Safe status (GRAS) for use in foods in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes. Bilberry fruit extracts have been used with apparent safety in clinical trials at a dose of up to 160 mg daily for up to 6 months (39, 40, 8139, 9739, 14280, 35472, 35510, 35512, 103190, 104192, 104195). A higher bilberry extract dose of 1.4 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 4 weeks (104194). Whole bilberries or bilberry juice have also been consumed with apparent safety in quantities of 100-160 grams daily for up to 35 days (35463, 91506).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when the leaves are used orally in high doses or for a prolonged period. Death can occur with chronic use of 1.5 gram/kg daily (2).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in the amounts commonly found in foods. However, there is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of bilberry when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy and lactation; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, bilberry fruit, juice, and extracts seem to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dark-colored stools, flatulence, and gastrointestinal discomfort.\nGastrointestinal\nIn one small clinical trial, mild-to-moderate flatulence was reported in 33% of patients taking sieved bilberries and concentrated bilberry juice (91506). However, the patients in this study had ulcerative colitis, and the study lacked a control group, limiting the validity of this finding. In another small clinical study of males with age-related cognitive impairment, temporary adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects were reported in 13% of patients drinking a combination of bilberry and grape juice. However, the adverse GI effect rate was identical in patients drinking a placebo juice (110641). A post-marketing surveillance report of 2295 patients using bilberry extract (Tegens) found that 1% of patients complained of GI discomfort and less than 1% experienced nausea or heartburn (35500).\n\nTheoretically, fresh bilberry fruit may have laxative effects. One clinical trial noted an increased frequency of bowel movements following the administration of a combination formulation containing aerial agrimony parts, cinnamon quills, powdered bilberry fruit, and slippery elm bark (35462). It is unclear if these effects were due to bilberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOther\nOrally, bilberry may cause discoloration of feces and the tongue. In one study, a dark-bluish to black discoloration of both the feces and the tongue was observed following consumption of sieved bilberries and concentrated bilberry juice. In one patient, a slight discoloration of the teeth has also been observed (91506). In another study, 50% of patients reported dark green stools after taking bilberry extract 700 mg twice daily for 4 weeks (104194).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nNight vision. Most research suggests that oral bilberry does not improve night vision in healthy individuals.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of bilberry for improving night vision; however, much of the research is of poor quality. In general, the most rigorous research shows that bilberry is not effective for improving night vision in healthy individuals (8139, 9739, 14280, 35446). Whether bilberry can improve night vision in patients with night blindness is unclear.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral bilberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study of elderly Norwegian males with subjective cognitive impairment shows that drinking 330 mL of bilberry and red grape juice twice daily for 9 weeks does not improve measures of memory or motor skills when compared with placebo (110641).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nAsthenopia (eye strain). Small clinical studies suggest that oral bilberry fruit extract may improve objective measures of asthenopia, but it is unclear if oral bilberry improves subjective symptoms of asthenopia.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults who report general eye strain or those who look at computer or other display screens at work for long periods of time show that taking bilberry-derived anthocyanins 43.2 mg daily for 6 weeks or bilberry extract 240 mg daily for 12 weeks improves objective measures of eye strain after staring at computer screens when compared with placebo (103190, 104195). However, bilberry extract did not improve subjective measures of eye strain in the study that evaluated these outcomes (104195). This study may have been underpowered to detect significant differences between groups.\n\nBilberry has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for improving eye strain. A small clinical trial in patients with eye strain shows that a combination of fish oil, lutein, and bilberry extract containing bilberry anthocyanidins 59 mg, taken daily for 4 weeks, reduces dry eye, lower back pain, shoulder stiffness, and stuffy head when compared with placebo (35470). It is unclear if these effects are due to bilberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nCataracts. Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI). It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with CVI.\nOne small clinical study in patients with CVI shows that taking bilberry extract containing anthocyanins 173 mg daily for 30 days reduces symptoms of CVI when compared with placebo (35510).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific extract of bilberry fruit (Mirtoselect, Indena S.p.A) 470 mg once, prior to taking an oral glucose tolerance test, lowers plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo (91507). However, a small crossover trial in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking bilberry fruit extract 700 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, blood pressure, or lipid levels when compared with placebo (104194). The validity of the HbA1c-related findings is limited due to the short study duration.\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy shows that taking bilberry fruit extract 160 mg daily for 6 months, in addition to standard management, improves edema and measures of retinal circulatory health when compared with standard management alone. Bilberry in the form of a generic, commercially available product appears to produce less dramatic improvements than a branded formulation (Mirtoselect, Indena S.p.A.) containing matching anthocyanin content. This specific product also reduced flow velocity in those with high-flow, diabetic retinopathy when compared with either the generic bilberry extract or standard management alone (97032).\nless\nDry eye. Oral bilberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with severe dry eye symptoms suggests that taking bilberry extract 600 mg and docosahexaenoic fish oil 240 mg once daily for 3 months may modestly improve measures of tear quality and patient-reported scores for dry eye symptoms when compared with control (112415). However, the validity of these results is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to bilberry, fish oil, or the combination.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nOne small clinical study in patients with dysmenorrhea shows that a specific bilberry product (Tegens) containing bilberry anthocyanoside 160 mg, taken twice daily beginning 3 days prior to menses and continuing for 8 days, reduces pelvic pain, lumbosacral pain, breast pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache when compared with placebo (35512).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small clinical study in trained athletes shows that drinking 200 mL of bilberry juice, containing about 744 mg phenols and 80 mg anthocyanins, twice daily for 5 days prior to running a half-marathon modestly worsens muscle soreness immediately after the run when compared with placebo. There was no longer a difference in muscle soreness between groups within 1-2 days after the run (99540).\nless\nGlaucoma. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bilberry fruit extract, when taken with maritime pine extract, may lower intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. It is unclear if oral bilberry alone is beneficial in patients with glaucoma.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical trial in Japanese patients with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking a specific product (Sante Glagenox, Saten Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) containing bilberry fruit extract 90 mg and maritime pine extract 40 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces intraocular pressure by 8.7% when compared to baseline (104192). Another small clinical study in patients with high intraocular pressure shows that taking a specific product (Mirtogenol) containing bilberry fruit extract (Mirtoselect, Indena S.p.A.) 80 mg and maritime pine extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 40 mg twice daily for 6 months lowers intraocular pressure and improves intraocular blood flow when compared with no treatment (35456). It is unclear if these findings are due to bilberry, maritime pine, or the combination. A retrospective chart review of patients with normal tension glaucoma has found that taking bilberry anthocyanin 60 mg twice daily for at least 12 months is associated with improvements in visual function when compared to pretreatment (35472).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for hemorrhoids, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA small clinical study in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking bilberry-derived anthocyanins 320 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels. Further, no improvements in other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease were reported (110640). The validity of this study is limited by its short duration.\nless\nHypertension. Oral bilberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in adults with hypertension shows that consuming 500 mL of a juice containing bilberry, red grape, and chokeberry, with or without black currant (MANA Blue, TINE SA), daily for 12 weeks does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo (92371).\nless\nHypertensive retinopathy. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with hypertensive retinopathy.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy shows that taking bilberry fruit extract 160 mg daily for 6 months, in addition to standard management, improves edema and measures of retinal circulatory health when compared with standard management alone. Bilberry in the form of a generic, commercially available product appears to produce less dramatic improvements than a branded formulation (Mirtoselect, Indena S.p.A.) containing matching anthocyanin content. This specific product also increased flow velocity for those with ischemic, hypertensive retinopathy when compared with either the generic bilberry extract or standard management alone (97032).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral bilberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with impaired glucose tolerance and two markers of metabolic syndrome shows that consuming a diet high in whole grain products, fatty fish, and bilberries three times daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of plasma glucose when compared to baseline (35468). However, it is unclear if these findings are due to bilberry, another component of the diet, or the combination.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral bilberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with IBS shows that consuming a formula containing powdered bilberry fruit, aerial agrimony parts, cinnamon quills, and slippery elm bark modestly improves bowel movement frequency and reduces symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and straining when compared to baseline (35462). It is unclear if these findings are due to bilberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nOne small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming a diet containing 400 grams of fresh bilberries daily does not affect body weight, glucose metabolism, or lipid metabolism when compared with a control diet (35473).\nless\nMyopia. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with myopia.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with myopia shows that a specific fermented bilberry fruit extract (Fermented Blueberry, Ajinomoto, Co., Inc.) 200 mg, taken twice daily for 4 weeks, improves night vision as well as the eye's ability to adjust focus when compared with placebo. The amplitude of accommodation was also significantly increased from 4.62 to 5.33 (91505).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nOne small clinical study in obese and overweight females shows that consuming 100 grams of frozen, whole bilberries daily for 33-35 days decreases weight and waist circumference when compared to baseline (35463). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral bilberry is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nOne small, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis shows that consuming sieved bilberries and concentrated bilberry juice (Symrise GmbH & Co) 160 grams daily for 6 weeks induces remission in 46% of patients. Furthermore, 91% of patients achieved remission at the end of treatment, and 72% of patients achieved remission at the end of the study (91506). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nVaricose veins. Although there has been interest in using oral bilberry for varicose veins, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bilberry for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate bilberry for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBilberry fruit extract has most often been used in doses of 160-240 mg daily for up to 6 months. Bilberry extracts providing 120-160 mg of anthocyanins daily have also been used for 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nVarious formulations of bilberry are used medicinally. These include fresh bilberries, dried bilberries, bilberry juice, and bilberry extracts. A laboratory analysis addressing the quality of several bilberry products shows that commercially available dried bilberries and bilberry juice are generally of good quality, although quality-related concerns exist for bilberry extracts. Of the 11 bilberry extract supplements analyzed, 45% were considered to be of unacceptable quality. Some of these products were found to contain no bilberry, only trace levels of anthocyanins, or anthocyanins from other sources (104193).\n\nBilberry VMA (Vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanoside, the anthocyanoside component of the extract), standardized to contain 25% anthocyanidin, has been used in most European studies. However, the strength and dosing of preparations available in the United States may differ from those used in European studies. Patients may be advised to follow specific dosing instructions for each formulation.\n\nMirtogenol, a trademark of Indena S.p.A., and Horphag Research Ltd., is a patent-pending proprietary combination of standardized bilberry extract (Mirtoselect, Indena, S.p.A.) and maritime pine extract (Pycnogenol). Mirtoselect is a standardized extract containing anthocyanins and is obtained exclusively from fresh bilberry fruits that are harvested when ripe, between July and September (35456).\n\nFermented Blueberry (Ajinomoto, Co., Inc.), is a polyphenol-rich fraction obtained from bilberry fermentation with wine yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and purified by precipitation with hot alcohol (91505).\n\nIn a clinical trial, bilberry (Symrise GmbH & Co), was prepared under standardized conditions with dried, sieved bilberries (59.63%) and concentrated bilberry juice (25.90%) (91506).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with bilberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals, absorption of anthocyanosides from bilberry (VMA) after oral administration is low. Following oral doses in rats, absolute bioavailability of VMA was 1.2% of the administered dose (35461). The gastrointestinal absorption of VMA was 5% of the administered dose. After administration of a specific bilberry extract (Bilberon 25, Tokiwa Phytochemical Co.) containing 15 different anthocyanidins, anthocyanidin absorption ranged from 0.61% to 1.82%. For all anthocyanidins combined, bioavailability was 0.93% (16624).\n\nA small clinical study in humans suggests that consuming bilberry extract 10 grams encapsulated in whey protein might increase the absorption of VMA when compared with consuming a non-encapsulated extract (99541).\nDistribution\nIn one animal study, bilberry anthocyanosides (VMA) were rapidly distributed after intraperitoneal injection and intravenous administration (35461). Another study found a differential affinity of VMA for certain tissues, especially the skin and the kidneys (35494). This suggests that different tissues may have more persistent local concentrations.\nMetabolism\nA small clinical study in humans suggests that consuming bilberry extract 10 grams encapsulated in citrus pectin might slow metabolism and degradation of bilberry anthocyanidins when compared with consuming a non-encapsulated extract (99541).\nExcretion\nIn an animal study, bilberry anthocyanosides were found to be eliminated via the bile and urine with a modest level of liver extraction (8141).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "Anti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, a supplement containing mixed berry-derived anthocyanin isolates (Medox) decreased levels of various proinflammatory chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8], regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES], and interferon-alpha [IFN-alpha]) and cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) (35453). Dietary supplementation of bilberry, either alone or as part of a \"healthy diet,\" has also been shown to lower serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), E-selectin, and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG) (35467, 35459, 35473). Mixed findings have been found with regard to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), with some research demonstrating decreased levels following dietary bilberry consumption (frozen whole berries) (35463) and others demonstrating increases (bilberry juice) (35459). Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation has been purported as a possible mechanism of action underpinning bilberry's observed anti-inflammatory effects (35453, 35459).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn an in vitro study using Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus Oxford, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, an aqueous extract of bilberry leaves had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.7-17.8mg/mL, and an aqueous extract of bilberry fruit had a MIC of 15.4-30.7mg/mL (35489).\nAnticancer effects\nIn an in vitro study, anthocyanin-rich extracts from bilberry inhibited the growth of a colon cancer cell line (35448).\n\nBomser et al. screened fruit extracts of bilberry for potential anticarcinogenic compounds by a combination of fractionation and in vitro testing of their ability to induce the phase 2 xenobiotic detoxification enzyme quinone reductase (QR) and to inhibit the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, by the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) (35499). The crude extracts, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanidin fractions were not found to be highly active in phase 2 xenobiotic detoxification enzyme QR induction, whereas the ethyl acetate extracts were active QR inducers. The concentrations required to double QR activity (designated CDqr) for the ethyl acetate extracts of bilberry were 1.0mcg of tannic acid equivalents (TAE). Further fractionation of the bilberry ethyl acetate extract revealed that the majority of inducer potency was contained in a hexane-chloroform subfraction (CDqr=0.07mcg of TAE). The anthocyanidin and ethyl acetate extracts of bilberry were either inactive or relatively weak inhibitors of ODC activity. The authors concluded that components of the hexane-chloroform fraction of bilberry exhibited potential anticarcinogenic activity, as evaluated by in vitro screening tests.\nAntioxidant effects\nBilberry contains anthocyanosides that are flavonoid derivatives of anthocyanins (the blue, red, or violet pigments found in many berry varieties), which are closely related in structure and activity to flavonoids (35485) and possess free radical-scavenging and antioxidant properties. Antioxidant properties have been attributed to bilberry in in vitro studies (35457, 35495, 35496, 35497, 35498). Specifically, anthocyanins and other phenolics from bilberry upregulated the oxidative stress defense enzymes heme-oxygenase-1 and glutathione S-transferase-p in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells, suggesting that they stimulate signal transduction pathways, influencing genes controlled by the antioxidant response element (35452). In human research, dietary consumption of 160 grams of mixed berries (bilberries, black currants, chokeberries, and lingonberries) daily for eight weeks increased the plasma level of various polyphenols compared to placebo, including quercetin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid, homovanillic acid, vanillic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (35458). In another study, drinking bilberry and red grape juice increased plasma levels of the polyphenols mentioned above, in addition to hippuric acid and lactate dehydrogenase (110641).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn a clinical study of 30 subjects with normal platelet aggregation, 480 mg of Myrtocyan (bilberry anthocyanins) daily, 3 grams of ascorbic acid daily, or both treatments combined, all reduced platelet aggregation after 30 and 60 days (35503). Bilberry anthocyanins reduced platelet aggregation more than ascorbic acid alone, but bilberry anthocyanins and ascorbic acid together were the most effective. In other human research, a diet rich in various types of berries, including bilberry, inhibited platelet function despite a lack of change in plasma biomarkers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet activation (35455). Similarly, in in vitro studies, anthocyanins extracted from bilberry inhibited platelet aggregation (35478, 35505, 35502, 35504).\n\nFlavonoids have been shown in vitro to inhibit prostacyclin synthesis. In one animal model, bilberry anthocyanosides were studied for their effects on prostacyclin-like activity in rat arterial tissue (35500).\nAntiproliferative effects\nAccording to one laboratory study, anthocyanins were the predominant phenolic compounds in bilberry extracts (35451). Compared to other plants with anthocyanins, such as black currant or lingonberry, cell growth inhibition was greater for bilberry than other plants studied. The pro-apoptosis marker Bax increased 1.3-fold in bilberry-treated cells, whereas the pro-survival marker Bcl-2 was detected only in control cells. The results demonstrated that bilberry and other berry extracts containing anthocyanins inhibited cancer cell proliferation, mainly via the p21WAF1 pathway.\nAntiulcer effects\nBilberry extract has been suggested as a promoter of gastric ulcer healing, with support from animal data (35474). In an animal study, large doses of cyanidin chloride from bilberry significantly increased gastric mucosal release of prostaglandin E2 (35465). In animal models of gastric ulcers, cyanidin chloride showed antiulcer activity (16629, 35474), as did IdB1027, a natural flavonoid from bilberry anthocyanoside extract (8141, 16629, 35465, 35494). H. pylori bacteria have been implicated in many cases of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Berry extracts have been shown to inhibit H. pylori bacteria in vitro and to enhance susceptibility to clarithromycin (35449).\nConnective tissue-stabilizing effects\nAn in vitro study has suggested that anthocyanosides appear to stabilize connective tissue by enhancing collagen synthesis, inhibiting collagen degradation, and enhancing collagen cross-linking (35486). In contrast, other research found a significant decrease in connective tissue synthesis (collagen and glycoproteins) in gingival tissue samples of 12 adult diabetics treated with 600 mg of anthocyanosides daily for two months (35493).\nConstituents\nBilberry contains several compounds that have demonstrated biological activity. The main chemicals contained in bilberry extract have been shown to be anthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and anthocyanosides (35451, 35452, 35464); as well as flavonoids, quercetin, epicatechin, hydroquinone, oleanolic acid, neomyrtillin, sodium, tannins, and ursolic acid (8141, 35459, 35485, 35494, 35518, 35519). Bilberry also contains resveratrol (16053, 35447, 35459, 35458). The anthocyanosides, tannins, and flavonoids have been of particular scientific interest. Flavonoids have been shown in vitro to possess a number of biological properties, including inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis, reduction of capillary permeability and fragility, free radical scavenging, inhibition of a wide range of enzymes, impairment of coagulation and platelet aggregation, and anti-carcinogenicity (35499, 35518).\nEndothelial effects\nIn human research, mixed-berry derived anthocyanins have been shown to increase both flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and cGMP, and decrease soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) (35469). However, the effects of anthocyanins on endothelial function were abrogated upon exposure to NO-cGMP inhibitors, suggesting a possible NO-cGMP-mediated mechanism of action. One dietary intervention study in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism also reported a decrease in plasma E-selectin following the coadministration of a \"healthy diet\" of bilberries, whole grains, and fatty fish (35467).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn humans with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a combination formulation containing aerial agrimony parts, cinnamon quills, powdered bilberry fruit, and slippery elm bark was shown to mitigate various IBS symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, straining) in spite of a lack of efficacy in improving bowel habit; the frequency of bowel movements was increased following combination bilberry treatment (35462). In humans with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, a bilberry formulation (Symrise GmbH & Co), improved patient symptoms. It is possible bilberry has direct anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal mucosa, as well as antioxidant properties (91506).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn an animal study, anthocyans exerted a protective effect on liver cells (35491). Preliminary research in an animal model shows that a specific bilberry extract containing 42% anthocyanidins decreases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in experimentally induced liver damage (16625).\nHypoglycemic effects\nLimited animal data suggest that bilberry leaf extract possesses hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering properties that may be beneficial in patients with diabetes (1264). In normal and de-pancreatized dogs, oral administration of bilberry leaves reduced hyperglycemia, even when the glucose was injected intravenously concurrently (35506, 35507). Conversely, in an oral glucose tolerance test in healthy rats, an alcoholic extract of bilberry leaves increased serum glucose levels compared to controls (35508). In a dietary intervention study involving individuals with impaired glucose metabolism, decreased glucose concentration and glucose area under the curve were observed following the coadministration of a \"healthy diet\" of bilberries, whole grains, and fatty fish (35468). Dietary consumption of whole, frozen bilberries has also been shown to decrease adiponectin and increase both insulin and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (35463). Bilberry polyphenols may inhibit intestinal alpha-glucosidase activity and glucose transport in vitro. Phenolic acids and flavonols with inhibitory activity against intestinal glucose uptake are common polyphenolic constituents of berries. Thus, both a reduced breakdown of carbohydrates and lowered intestinal absorption may contribute to the improvement in glucose levels (91507).\nHypotensive effects\nBilberry has been theorized to lower blood pressure based on preclinical evidence of vascular smooth muscle-relaxing properties (35454, 35514, 35515). In human research, a diet rich in various types of berries demonstrated reductions in systolic blood pressure, particularly in individuals with an elevated baseline blood pressure (35455).\nImmunosuppressant effects\nIn human research, dietary consumption of fresh bilberries decreased expression of CCR2 and MMD transcripts in genes associated with monocyte and macrophage function (35473).\nInsulin effects\nIn healthy humans, a fermented oatmeal drink with 10% added bilberry fruit reduced postprandial insulin demand in spite of an elevated glucose response (35466).\nIntracellular signaling effects\nAnthocyanosides have been shown to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways (16629).\nLipid effects\nIn human research, mixed berry-derived anthocyanins and mixed berry-rich diets have been shown to increase plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (35455, 35469). However, other human studies have reported a lack of effect on lipid metabolism (35473, 110640).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nIn individuals with primary fibromyalgia, anthocyanidins derived from various types of berries including bilberry improved self-reported symptoms of sleep disturbances, investigator-assessed symptoms of fatigue, and overall health, as assessed by a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ28) (35520).\nOcular effects\nAnthocyanosides have been shown to exert direct effects on the retina (35476), including the alteration of local enzymatic reactions and enhancement of the recovery of rhodopsin (35479). The multi-ingredient product Mirtogenol (combination of Pycnogenol, a maritime pine extract, and Mirtoselect, a standardized bilberry extract) has been reported to lower intraocular pressure and improve ocular blood flow (35456, 97032). Other combination bilberry supplements have been shown to improve symptoms of asthenopia, such as bilberry, docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], and lutein (35470), or positively affect visual acuity and visual field in individuals with dry form age-related macular degeneration (e.g., Focus) (35471). One retrospective analysis of glaucoma patients demonstrated improvements in Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) and the minimal angle of resolution logarithm for best-corrected visual acuity (logMAR BCVA) following bilberry anthocyanin supplementation (35472). Bilberry seems to improve the amplitude of accommodation and mesopic contrast sensitivity. It is possible that accelerated re-synthesis of rhodopsin, modulation of retinal enzyme activity, and improved microcirculation play a role in the improvement of visual function (91505).\nRenal effects\nAdministration of a bilberry extract reduces blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels in experimentally induced kidney damage (16627). Bilberry is thought to reduce liver and kidney damage through free radical scavenging and reducing lipid peroxidation (16625).\nSmooth muscle relaxant effects\nAnthocyanoside extracts have been shown to have smooth muscle-relaxing activity, which may account for their purported effects in one series of women with dysmenorrhea (35512). Bioflavonoids and extracts of anthocyanosides (such as those present in bilberry) have been shown to relax vascular smooth muscles in experimental models, possibly via stimulation of prostaglandins (35454, 35514, 35515).\nVasoprotective effects\nFlavonoids have been shown in vitro to reduce capillary permeability and fragility. Anthocyanosides have been studied for their potential protective effect in disorders due to abnormal capillary fragility (35518, 35521). Preliminary evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies has suggested that bilberry extracts may be useful in the prevention of vascular disease (35454, 35475, 35480) and may reduce platelet aggregation and oxidation of LDL (1264, 35492, 35495, 35501, 35522). In an animal experiment looking at ischemia-reperfusion injury in hamster cheek microcirculation, bilberry anthocyanoside (VMA) extract was shown to reduce microvascular impairment after reperfusion (35488). In another animal study, VMA extract was shown to reduce vascular permeability in the setting of hypertension (35475). Decreases in lipid deposition and intimal proliferation have also been demonstrated in VMA-treated animals (35483).\n\nSome evidence suggests that bilberry might decrease levels of microvesicles in the blood, which are associated with vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. A small, open-label study in patients recovering from myocardial infarction shows that taking bilberry extract 300 mg three times daily for 8 weeks reduces levels of endothelial- and platelet-derived microvesicles when compared with a control. In vitro research suggests that these improvements may be due to decreased P2X7-dependent endothelial extracellular vesicle release, Akt phosphorylation, and vesiculation-related gene expression (104191)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Biotin is an essential, water-soluble B vitamin also known as vitamin B7. Biotin serves as a cofactor for biotin-dependent carboxylases which participate in fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid catabolism (19353, 89471). In 1942, the role of biotin as an essential vitamin in humans was confirmed by demonstrating biotin deficiency, referred to then as \"egg-white injury\", in human volunteers. This is because raw egg whites contain avidin, which binds to biotin and prevents its absorption (35576, 35620).",

A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established (1900, 6243, 95662, 102965). ...when applied topically as cosmetic products at concentrations of 0.0001% to 0.6% biotin (19344).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used intramuscularly and appropriately (8468, 111366).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at adequate intake doses of 5-25 mcg daily for up to 6 months (173, 6243, 19347, 19348, 111365). A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at the adequate intake (AI) dose of 30 mcg daily during pregnancy and 35 mcg daily during lactation. It has also been used in supplemental doses of up to 300 mcg daily (6243, 7878). A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established.",

Transient mild diarrhea was reported by 2 patients taking biotin 300 mg daily (95662).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nIn one case report in France, a 76-year-old female frequent traveler developed eosinophilic pleuropericarditis after taking biotin 10 mg and pantothenic acid 300 mg daily for 2 months. She had also been taking trimetazidine for 6 years (3914). Whether eosinophilia in this case was related to biotin, pantothenic acid, other substances, or patient-specific conditions is unknown. There have been no other similar reports.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nBiotin deficiency. Oral and injectable biotin prevents and treats biotin deficiency.\nBiotin up to 10 mg daily has been used to treat and prevent biotin deficiency. Injections of biotin 150 mcg daily for 3-5 days have been used in adults. Biotin deficiency might occur due to different etiologies such as inherited biotinidase deficiency, malnutrition, chronic use of anticonvulsants, pregnancy, and excessive and chronic raw egg consumption (6243, 19347). A very small study in newborns aged 1-6 months shows that adding biotin to infant formula safely improves biotin status in formula-fed infants (111365). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, no randomization, and the small sample size.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). In spite of contrary reports, high-dose biotin (300 mg daily) does not reduce disability in patients with progressive MS. It also does not seem to be linked to an increased risk for relapse.\nAlthough most earlier research suggested benefit, the highest quality evidence shows that high-dose biotin does not improve outcomes in progressive MS (95662, 102963, 102966, 104011). A large multi-centered randomized clinical trial (SPI2) in patients with progressive MS and high disability shows that taking biotin 100 mg three times daily for 15 months does not improve disability, as measured on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), or 25-foot walking time, when compared with placebo. The SPI2 clinical trial also did not find that biotin increases the rate of relapse (104011), a concern raised in one observational study of high-dose biotin (104000). Also, a large observational study of adults with progressive MS failed to identity an increase in annualized relapse rates in patients that reported taking biotin when compared with controls (105716). Other observational research has also found no effect on the relapse risk (102963, 102964). There is some speculation that any increased rate of relapse identified in some high-dose biotin cohorts might be due to detection bias or reduced compliance with disease-modifying therapies.\nless\nSeborrheic dermatitis. Oral biotin doesn't seem to improve seborrheic dermatitis of infancy.\nA clinical trial in infants with seborrheic dermatitis shows that biotin given by mouth does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo (8469).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlopecia areata. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for alopecia areata.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with alopecia areata shows that weekly injections of intramuscular biotin 5 mg/1 mL and dexpanthenol 250 mg/2 mL for 6 weeks reduces hair fall count and transiently increases hair density compared with baseline (111366). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a placebo control group, small sample size, and short duration of treatment. It is unclear if the effects are due to biotin, dexpanthenol, or the combination.\n\nAnother small clinical study in 9-year-old children with alopecia areata shows that taking biotin 20 mg with zinc aspartate 100 mg orally along with topical application of clobetasol propionate 0.025% daily for one year promotes hair regrowth in 33% of children, compared with 0% in the group receiving the steroid deflazacort (6932). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, zinc, topical clobetasol, or the combination.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Although there is interest in using oral biotin for ALS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition.\nBiotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. Adding oral biotin to oral thiamine does not seem to improve most symptoms associated with this condition, although it may slightly speed recovery from acute crisis in children.\nA small case series in children ages 1-12 years with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease has found that adding biotin 5 mg/kg daily to thiamine 40 mg/kg daily for 30 months is not associated with additional symptomatic improvement in encephalopathy, seizures, dystonia, or other neurologic sequelae when compared with taking only thiamine. However, taking biotin with thiamine is associated with a 1-day reduction in recovery from acute crisis when compared with thiamine alone (95661).\nless\nBrittle nails. Low quality studies suggest that oral biotin might improve nail thickness and prevent the splitting of brittle nails.\nSome small, low quality clinical studies in people with brittle nails shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg orally daily for 1.5 to 15 months increases nail thickness and decreases the splitting of fingernails and toenails in some people when compared with baseline (171, 35593). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study sizes and the lack of a comparator group.\n\nBiotin has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small retrospective observational study in adults with brittle nails suggests that taking oral biotin 1 mg combined with vitamin B6 100 mg daily for 3 months leads to a complete response rate (>90% improvement) in 70% of participants compared with 10% and 11% with biotin and vitamin B6 alone, respectively, at 6-9 months post-treatment. The validity of these findings is limited by the poor methodology, including lack of blinding and lack of a control group (116681).\nless\nDepression. Although there is interest in using oral biotin for mild depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking biotin 1.5-15 mg orally daily for 1-3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose or serum insulin levels when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of subjects with and without diabetes (110044). A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that taking biotin 5 mg three times daily for 28 days does not affect glucose or insulin levels when compared to baseline (11579).\n\nBiotin has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that a taking a specific supplement containing a combination of biotin 2 mg and chromium picolinate 600 mcg (Diachrome, Nutrition 21) can lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on oral hypoglycemic drugs (12385, 12390, 15169). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, chromium, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Although there is interest in using oral and intramuscular biotin for diabetic neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition.\nMuscle cramps. It is unclear if biotin is beneficial for improving muscle cramps in patients undergoing hemodialysis.\nPatients undergoing hemodialysis are prone to muscle cramps. A small clinical study in patients with hemodialysis-related muscle cramps shows that taking biotin 1 mg in the morning daily for at least one week prevents and reduces severity of muscle cramps when compared to baseline. Cessation of biotin led to recurrence of cramps, and restarting oral biotin led to resolution of cramps during hemodialysis (89475). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate biotin for these uses.",

It has also been used in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months (102965). Lab test interactions are more likely to occur with the use of these higher doses.\n\nAvidin, a protein in raw egg whites, binds to biotin in the intestine and prevents biotin absorption (6243, 19352, 19355).

Taking biotin 300 mg orally results in a serum biotin concentration of up to 1200 ng/mL, and causes 6.7% of IgM anti-HAV to be falsely negative. Biotin does not appear to affect total anti-HAV assays. It also does not appear to affect hepatitis B virus core antigen (anti-HBc) assays or hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) assays (104001).

Although some bacterially-synthesized biotin can be absorbed from the lower intestine, this appears to contribute less than 20% of a person's daily requirement for biotin (2677, 4437, 6243, 19349).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with biotin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, biotin is completely absorbed and reaches peak concentration after 1-2 hours (8758, 104002). However, dietary biotin is bound to lysine residues of protein. Before it can become bioactive, it must be cleaved by biotinidase from food proteins (89471). After being cleaved, biotin is transported across the intestinal lumen enterocytes by the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) and into the liver and peripheral tissues (89471, 89472). Biotin can be absorbed by passive diffusion when extracellular levels of biotin exceed 25 mcM/L (35602).\nDistribution\nFollowing oral absorption, SMVT mediates biotin uptake into liver and peripheral tissues; SMVT also mediates renal reabsorption of biotin (19353). When administered intravenously, a large fraction of biotin is stored in the liver, where mitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylase serves as a biotin reservoir (19353, 35605, 35610). In contrast to the kidney and liver, the central nervous system retains most of its biotin during phases of depletion (35550, 35573).\nMetabolism\nBiotin metabolites are formed by beta-oxidation, sulfur oxidation, or both (35528).\nExcretion\nAbout half of the dose of biotin is excreted within 24 hours (8758). Biotin is excreted in the urine as unmetabolized biotin or as the biotin metabolites bisnorbiotin, biotind,l-sulfoxides, bisnorbiotin methyl ketone, biotin sulfone, and tetranorbiotin-l-sulfoxide (19353, 35613). Animal research suggests that biliary excretion is relatively minor (35615).\n\nBiotin is recycled endogenously. This may be the reason why deficiency symptoms take a long time to develop and are rarely seen in humans (173).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBiotin is a vitamin that is found in small amounts in numerous foods. In food, biotin is protein bound and is cleaved by the enzyme biotinidase (35526). Biotin is also synthesized in animals by intestinal microflora. Researchers think biotin is stored in the mitochondria, and that it acts as a coenzyme in bicarbonate-dependent carboxylation reactions (6243). Biotin-containing enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, propionate metabolism, and the catabolism of leucine in mammals (173, 19353). Pyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is a biotin-dependent enzyme (35616). Decreased activity of this enzyme during biotin deficiency may result in accumulation of pyruvate or decreased aspartate concentration (8468).\n\nBiotin deficiency is difficult to detect because of the lack of assay techniques to determine biotin concentrations in blood (8501). Symptoms of deficiency include thinning of the hair, frequently with loss of hair color, and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Neurological symptoms, including depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and paresthesias of the extremities, are also common in biotin deficiency (6243, 35583, 35600, 35606, 35611). Biotin deficiency is most likely to occur in people with congenital biotinidase deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, such as short-gut syndrome, during pregnancy, and in people receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (6243, 7878, 8501). There is some evidence that diabetes may produce a biotin-deficient state (8468).\nAntidiabetes effects\nBlood glucose concentrations decrease as plasma and tissue concentrations of biotin increase in people with and without diabetes, but this effect is more dramatic in people with diabetes (7880). Animal research suggests that biotin reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating the expression of proteins/enzymes that favor hypoglycemia such as insulin, pancreatic glucokinase, and hepatic glucokinase, as well as inhibiting the expression of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (an enzyme that stimulates glucose production) (35529, 35557).\nCarcinogenic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that biotin might have some mutagenic effects, however this has not been seen in animals or humans. In vitro, biotin induced the expression and activity of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) in human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) cells, which increased breaks of single-stranded DNA (19350).\nDevelopmental effects\nDietary biotin deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or teratogenicity in animal research (35556). Laboratory evidence suggests that biotin may be involved in mesenchyme proliferation (35556).\nFertility effects\nBiotin deficiency has reportedly been associated with delayed spermatogenesis and decreased number of spermatozoa (35556). Animal research suggests that biotin deficiency is associated with decreased testicular and serum levels of testosterone. Treatment with biotin or biotin in combination with testosterone appears to normalize spermatogenesis in these animals. It is postulated that biotin may be involved in the formation of local testicular factor(s) involved in Leydig, Sertoli, and peritubular cell interactions that occur during spermatogenesis (35556).\nGrowth effects\nBiotin appears to improve brittle nails by inducing epidermal differentiation (35569). Preliminary, low-quality, clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks increases nail growth rate by 13% when compared with baseline. Applying minoxidil 5% topical spray twice daily increases nail growth rate more than biotin, but concomitant use of both biotin and minoxidil does not seem to provide further benefit. The validity of these findings is limited by non-randomized treatment allocation (105717).\nHair growth effects\nIn young, healthy males with normal hair growth, taking biotin 5 mg daily orally in combination with minoxidil 5% applied topically for 14 days increases the mean hair growth rate by about 0.3 mm per week when compared to baseline. Using either treatment alone does not increase the hair growth rate. Biotin may act as a cofactor in the hair growth cycle (114724).\nImmunomodulating effects\nMost evidence suggests that biotin deficiency has negative effects on immune function. Cases of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) not associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency have been associated with biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiency (35601). Also, biotin deficiency has been associated with thymic atrophy, decreased proliferation of spleen cells, reduced antibody synthesis, and delayed rejection of skin allographs (35607). However, the effects of biotin supplementation on immune function are less consistent. In biotin-deficient animals, treatment with biotin supplements seems to restore immune function (35607). However, biotin supplementation appears to reduce the activity of interleukins and interferons and decrease the number of lymphocytes when administered to healthy adults (7879).\nLipid-lowering effects\nSome evidence from animal research suggests that biotin may affect lipid metabolism by decreasing the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC 2), an enzyme that regulates fatty acid oxidation (35557). Decreasing the activity of ACC 2 appears to increase fatty acid oxidation by decreasing levels of malonyl-CoA.\nNeurological effects\nIn studies of animals that were not biotin deficient, biotin modulated gene expression in animals and altered astrocyte glucose utilization (35546). It is postulated that high doses of biotin could improve symptoms of multiple sclerosis by activating the Krebs cycle in demyelinated nerve cells and activating fatty acid synthesis required for myelin synthesis (95662)."

Salicylate toxicity is also possible with use of bismuth subsalicylate specifically.\nDermatologic\nOrally, alopecia due to bismuth therapy has been reported (25797). A case of fixed drug eruption attributed to treatment with bismuth subcitrate has been confirmed with a drug challenge test (106809). Pruritus was a side effect in clinical trials investigating bismuth with antibiotics (26334, 97823). However, the effect of bismuth alone is unclear.\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, glandular atrophy was a side effect in a clinical trial investigating colloidal bismuth subcitrate taken in combination with tetracycline and furazolidone (26335). However, the effect of bismuth alone is unclear.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, bismuth that is not absorbed is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts and may cause stools to appear grayish black (25770, 26333, 29957, 101113). Also, bismuth may cause the tongue to turn black due to macular lingual pigmentation (26333, 29943, 29944, 101113). Other side effects of bismuth therapy, typically when used in combination with other medications including antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), include abdominal pain, constipation, chronic gastritis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and intestinal metaplasia (26313, 26322, 26326, 26327, 26328, 26329, 26330, 26331, 26332, 26333)(26334, 26335, 26336, 26337, 90291, 97817, 97823, 97824, 97825). However, when compared against non-bismuth containing regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection, the use of bismuth did not increase the risk of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (29957).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, aplastic anemia has been reported as a potential side effect of bismuth salts (26338). Lymphoid follicles are a reported side effect in a clinical trial investigating colloidal bismuth subcitrate in combination with tetracycline and furazolidone (26335). However, the effect of bismuth alone is unclear. Excessive intake of bismuth subnitrate may cause methemoglobinemia (29947, 29948).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, body pains have occurred in a clinical trial examining the effect of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate taken in combination with clarithromycin and lansoprazole (26322). However, the effect of bismuth alone is unclear.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, multiple cases of bismuth-related neurotoxicity have been reported (25775, 29942). In general, the risk of neurotoxicity from bismuth salts appears to be greater for colloidal bismuth than other forms due to the greater bioavailability of colloidal bismuth (25770). In most cases, the neurotoxicity results from excessive use of bismuth salts over prolonged time periods (up to 30 years) (25775, 29946). Bismuth-related neurotoxicity often presents as encephalopathy that generally occurs in two phases (25770, 29942). The first phase, which lasts for one week to several months, consists of nonspecific symptoms including depression, anxiety, irritability, phobias or delusions of persecution, somnolence, insomnia, hallucinations, headache, affect disorders, memory problems, attention disorders, and the inability to plan non-automatic activities. Unsteady gait, motor incoordination, and jerky movements may also occur (29942). During the second phase, most patients experience mental confusion, pseudo-tremor along with myoclonic jerks, walking and standing disturbances, and dysarthria (29942). The patients may also experience the inability to carry out simple instructions, sphincteric incontinence, muscle tone disturbances (hypotonia), and seizures (29942). Recovery from encephalopathy may take weeks to months.\n\nBecause bismuth subsalicylate is hydrolyzed in the stomach to form salicylate and bismuth oxychloride (25775), patients may present with salicylate toxicity following acute or chronic ingestion of bismuth subsalicylate (106807). In one case, a 79-year-old patient with chronic kidney disease presented with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, inattention, and ataxia following ingestion of bismuth subsalicylate 8.3-16.6 grams daily for 6 months. The patient improved with supportive care and with discontinuation of bismuth subsalicylate.\n\nOrally, other side effects of bismuth therapy, typically when used in combination with other medications including antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), include dizziness, headache, and fatigue (97817, 97823, 97824, 97825). However, when compared against non-bismuth containing regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection, the use of bismuth did not increase the risk of dizziness or headache (29957).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIntravenously, a case of radio-opaque punctate opacities on chest radiographs following injection of bismuth compound has been reported (26343).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, cases of nephrotoxicity or acute kidney failure resulting from short-term exposure to high levels of bismuth salts, including colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol) and bismuth sodium triglycollamate (Bistrimate), have been reported (25770, 29947). In one case, an adolescent experienced acute kidney failure, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and facial paresthesia, after consuming colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol) 18 grams in a single dose (25770). Although the patient underwent gastric lavage within 6 hours of ingesting the bismuth salt, multiple incidences of vomiting continued to occur daily for 9 days thereafter. The patient recovered after receiving the metal chelating agent penicillamine 20 mg/kg daily and undergoing hemodialysis therapy every other day or twice weekly until serum creatinine levels reached 2.1 mg/dL (25770). In another case, an adolescent experienced vomiting, tiredness, weakness, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) after ingesting bismuth sodium triglycollamate (Bistrimate) containing elemental bismuth 75 mg over a few hours (29947).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nTravelers' diarrhea. Oral bismuth subsalicylate is effective for the treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea.\nClinical guidelines published by the American College of Gastroenterology in 2016 give a strong recommendation for the use of bismuth subsalicylates to control and prevent mild to moderate travelers' diarrhea based on high-quality research. The salicylate part of bismuth salicylate has anti-diarrheal effects, reducing the incidence of diarrhea by approximately 40%. The bismuth moiety has anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties and is involved in the prevention of diarrhea (97815). Common doses for treatment are approximately 525 mg per dose in liquid or tablet formulations, every 30-60 minutes, for a maximum of 8 doses per 24 hours (97815). When used prophylactically, oral bismuth subsalicylate 1.05 grams or 2.1 grams is taken in 2-4 divided doses daily beginning the day before traveling and continuing until 2 days after returning home for trips lasting up to 3 weeks (29959, 97815).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHelicobacter pylori. The use of oral bismuth salts in combination with standard therapy, known as bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT), seems to improve H. Pylori eradication rates. Bismuth has also been evaluated as a component of other H. pylori treatment regimens, although the place of these regimens in clinical practice remains unclear.\nClinical guidelines published by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) in 2017 provide a strong recommendation for the use of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) as either a first-line treatment option or as a salvage regimen for H. pylori infection based on lower quality research. BQT consists of bismuth, tetracycline, a nitroimidazole (i.e. metronidazole), and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) for 10-14 days (97814). Various bismuth salts have been evaluated in studies of BQT, including bismuth subcitrate 108-300 mg three or four times daily or 220-240 mg twice daily; bismuth biskalcitrate 420 mg four times daily; tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 120-300 mg four times daily or 600 mg twice daily; bismuth subsalicylate 200 mg four times daily; or bismuth subcitrate potassium 420-560 mg four times daily (29949, 29950, 90291, 97817, 97818, 97822, 97823, 97825). However, the ACG guidelines specifically recommend the use of bismuth subcitrate 120-300 mg or bismuth subsalicylate 300 mg taken four times daily. The guidelines also recommend other first-line treatment regimens that do not contain bismuth, including clarithromycin triple therapy (CTT) consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and a PPI; concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI and 3 types of antibiotics; or sequential therapy consisting of a PPI and amoxicillin for 5-7 days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and a nitroimidazole for 5-7 days (97814).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that using BQT for 7-14 days eradicates H. pylori at a rate of 78% to 85%, compared with a rate of 69% to 83% in those receiving CTT or concomitant therapy (29949, 29950, 97822, 97823, 97825, 106808). BQT is also as effective as sequential bismuth-free therapies (97823). Some research suggests that triple therapies may be more suitable for certain patients because they are less complex and have a higher likelihood for compliance. However, BQT is 5% to 26% more effective than CTT in populations with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance and 33% to 75% more effective than CTT in populations with a high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance (29951, 29953, 97818, 97825). Thus, while CTT is considered a first-line treatment option, it is only recommended in areas of low clarithromycin resistance (97814).\n\nVarious forms of bismuth have been studied as an adjunct to CTT. An open-label study in adults with no prior treatment for H. pylori shows that adding either bismuth potassium citrate 220 mg or bismuth pectin 150-300 mg twice daily for 14 days to CTT eradicates H. pylori at a rate of 72% to 77% (110036). However, it is unclear how this compares to guideline-recommended regimens such as BQT. Other clinical research shows that using levofloxacin and BQT after failed first-line therapy is no more effective than levofloxacin plus triple therapy without bismuth (97824). BQT has also been compared to high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with a PPI and amoxicillin, which is a recommended salvage treatment option (97814, 110037). A meta-analysis of 6 non-blinded clinical studies that included 1677 adults shows that using BQT for 14 days eradicates H. pylori at a rate of 84%, compared with a rate of 85% in those receiving HDDT (110037).\n\nBismuth salts have also been evaluated as a component of triple therapy; however, these regimens are not discussed in the ACG guidelines (97814). Some clinical evidence shows that taking bismuth subcitrate 120 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg, and metronidazole 250 mg four times daily for 14 days eradicates H. pylori in 95% of patients, compared with 77% of those taking amoxicillin and metronidazole alone (29955). In addition, treatment with bismuth subnitrate 300 mg four times daily, omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 500 mg four times daily for 14 days eradicates H. pylori in 72% of patients, compared with 52% taking omeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 500 mg four times daily (25767). Other clinical evidence shows that treatment with colloidal bismuth subcitrate 120 mg, tetracycline 250 mg, and metronidazole 250 mg four times daily for 14 days eradicates H. pylori in 96% of patients, compared with 77% of those taking amoxicillin 1000 mg and omeprazole 40 mg twice daily (29956).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Oral bismuth subsalicylate seems to help prevent and treat peptic ulcers, when used alone and in combination with other treatments, respectively.\nSome clinical research shows that treatment with bismuth subnitrate 700 mg three times daily for 4 weeks is as effective as cimetidine 800 mg daily for 4 weeks at preventing peptic ulcer recurrence 12 months after treatment (25777). Bismuth salts have also been evaluated in conjunction with antibiotics for treating peptic ulcers associated with Helicobacter pylori infections. Clinical research suggests that treatment with bismuth subnitrate 300 mg four times daily, omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 500 mg four times daily for 14 days improves peptic ulcer healing in 100% of patients, compared with 58% of those taking omeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 500 mg four times daily (25767).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if oral bismuth subgallate improves complications resulting from bariatric surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients experiencing gas or stool odor related to loop duodenal switch surgery for at least 6 months shows that taking bismuth subgallate (Devrom) 400 mg three times daily with meals for one week does not improve quality of life when compared with placebo. Taking bismuth subgallate improves the odor of flatus and stool by 50% to 78% when compared with baseline (101113). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCholera. Oral bismuth subsalicylate does not seem to improve the duration or severity of cholera symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with cholera receiving routine cholera treatment shows that taking bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg alone or with Saccharomyces boulardii 250 mg every 6 hours for up to 84 hours does not reduce the length of hospitalization or the number and volume of emesis or stools when compared with placebo (98733).\nless\nDimethyl fumarate-induced side effects. Oral bismuth subsalicylate seems to improve the severity, but not the incidence, of gastrointestinal adverse effects resulting from dimethyl fumarate treatment.\nDimethyl fumarate can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects that can lead to treatment discontinuation. Preliminary clinical research in adults taking dimethyl fumarate shows that taking bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg 30 minutes prior to dimethyl fumarate twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce the risk of a gastrointestinal event or the time to the first adverse effect when compared with placebo. However, taking bismuth subsalicylate reduces the severity of flatulence and diarrhea by 39% and 38%, respectively, when compared with placebo (101112).\nless\nIleostomy odor. Oral bismuth subgallate seems to improve odor related to ileostomy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with odor problems related to an ileostomy shows that taking bismuth subgallate 400 mg three times daily for 1 week reduces or eliminates ileostomy odor in 67% of patients, compared with 33% of patients receiving placebo (25768).\nless\nMicroscopic colitis. Oral bismuth subsalicylate seems to reduce stool frequency in patients with various subtypes of microscopic colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with clinically active collagenous colitis shows that taking bismuth subsalicylate 786 mg three times daily for 8 weeks decreases stool frequency in more patients when compared with placebo. This same treatment in patients with clinically active lymphocytic colitis also appears to decrease stool frequency in more patients when compared with placebo; however, it is not clear if the between-group difference is statistically significant for this subtype of colitis due to the small population of patients evaluated in the study (29958).\nless\nMinor bleeding. It is unclear if topical bismuth subgallate is beneficial for the treatment of minor bleeding; the available clinical research has yielded mixed findings.\nA clinical study in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy or tonsillectomy shows that smearing swabs with a paste containing bismuth subgallate and epinephrine and placing the swabs in the adenoidal bed and tonsillar fossae for 2-3 minutes following the procedure reduces the mean total operating time by 1.6 minutes, the number of swabs needed to stop bleeding by 0.8, and the number of linen ties required to stop bleeding by 1.3 when compared with control swabs (25783). The paste used in the study was prepared by mixing bismuth subgallate powder 30 mg with epinephrine solution 0.7 mg/0.7 mL and normal saline 20-40 mL (25783). Other preliminary research shows that using a bismuth subgallate paste reduces bleeding time after harvesting donor palatal tissue by 2.6 minutes when compared with a moistened gauze (97821). However, clinical research shows that bismuth subgallate paste or swabs smeared with bismuth subgallate paste alone does not affect operating time, time needed to stop bleeding, incidence of postoperative hemorrhage, or perioperative blood loss when compared to control swabs (25781, 25782).\nless\nPouchitis. It is unclear if administration of an enema containing bismuth improves symptoms or induces remission in patients with pouchitis.\nA meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies shows that administering an enema containing bismuth carbomer induces remission in patients with pouchitis (97819); however, the individual studies included in this analysis yielded conflicting findings. One of these studies, which evaluated 12 patients with treatment-resistant pouchitis, shows that administering a 100 mL enema containing elemental bismuth 230 mg complexed with carbomer nightly for 45 days induces remission in 83% of patients. Of the responding patients, 60% maintained remission while receiving maintenance therapy with the bismuth carbomer enema administered every three nights for 1 year (25766). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Conversely, the other study, which was a higher-quality clinical study in 20 patients with active chronic pouchitis, shows that administering a bismuth carbomer enema containing elemental bismuth 270 mg nightly for 21 days does not improve symptoms of pouchitis when compared with placebo (25779).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate bismuth for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nDue to its low absorption following oral intake, acute poisoning due to inorganic water-insoluble bismuth salt is rare. Patients may present with kidney failure or encephalopathy following large doses or chronic use. Levels of less than 50 mcg/mL in the blood are not thought to be associated with toxicity in humans (29957). Because bismuth subsalicylate is hydrolyzed in the stomach to form salicylate and bismuth oxychloride (25775), patients may present with salicylate toxicity following acute or chronic ingestion of bismuth subsalicylate specifically (106807).\nTreatment\nTreatment of bismuth overdose is symptomatic and supportive. Chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA], D,L-2,3-dimercapto-propane-I-sulfonic acid [DMPS]) may facilitate the elimination of bismuth (25792, 25793, 25794, 25795, 25796, 25797); however, they have not been found to improve the clinical outcome. Recovery from kidney failure and/or encephalopathy may take weeks to months.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, oral bismuth subsalicylate is hydrolyzed in the stomach to form salicylate and bismuth oxychloride (25775). Less than 1% of bismuth is absorbed by the small intestines, while nearly all of the salicylate produced from bismuth subsalicylate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (25775). In healthy volunteers who consume a single oral dose of colloidal bismuth subcitrate, basic bismuth salicylate, basic bismuth gallate, basic bismuth carbonate, or bismuth aluminate, which each provide elemental bismuth 350 mg, or who consume basic bismuth nitrate on granulated gum karaya (which provides elemental bismuth 1480 mg), peak serum concentrations of bismuth occur between 20 and 60 minutes after ingestion, and mean peak concentrations range from 0.6 to 9.1 mcg/L (26361). Other clinical research shows that the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) for ranitidine bismuth citrate is 35% to 42% of the Cmax of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate following oral intake (26364). In humans, the median integrated 8-hour plasma bismuth concentration was significantly greater after oral colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol) than bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or bismuth subnitrate (Roter) (26365).\nDistribution\nIn the blood, the half-life of bismuth ranges from 3.5 minutes to 22 years (25770). Regardless of the method of administration (oral or intravenous) or the type of bismuth salt administered, absorbed bismuth binds to various serum proteins, including alpha2-macroglobulin, immunoglobulin M, beta-lipoprotein, and haptoglobulin. These proteins distribute bismuth to various organs, including the spleen, liver, heart, kidney, muscles, and brain (25770). The retention of bismuth in the kidney is longer than for other organs due to the fact that bismuth attaches to a metal-binding protein in proximal renal tubule cells (25770).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, bismuth from bismuth subsalicylate travels to the colon, where it reacts with hydrogen sulfide to afford bismuth sulfide (25775).\nExcretion\nBismuth that is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts (25770). Bismuth can also be excreted in saliva and urine (25770). In humans, the median 24-hour urinary excretion of bismuth following intake of ranitidine bismuth citrate has been measured to be 19.2 mcg following intake of ranitidine bismuth 196 mg twice daily, 36.4 mcg following intake of ranitidine bismuth 391 mg twice daily, and 68.7 mcg following intake of ranitidine bismuth 782 mg twice daily (26370). In humans, urinary excretion data suggests that the half-life of oral ranitidine bismuth citrate is about 45 days (26363). However, the half-life of bismuth citrate following intravenous injection has been estimated to be about 1.9 years (25791). In humans, the median 8-hour urinary excretion of bismuth appears to be significantly greater after oral colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol) than bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or bismuth subnitrate (Roter) (26365).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBismuth (Bi) is a chemical element with the atomic number 83 (90853). Despite being a heavy metal, bismuth salts are not considered to be carcinogenic (29961, 29957).\nAntibacterial effects\nAccording to laboratory research, bismuth salts, including bismuth subnitrate, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, and bismuth subsalicylate exert direct and indirect antimicrobial effects (26351). Both absorbable and nonabsorbable bismuth salts appear to inhibit protein and cell wall synthesis of gastrointestinal pathogens such as H. pylori (25765, 26345). Also, in vitro evidence shows that ranitidine bismuth citrate and colloidal bismuth citrate, but not ranitidine alone, reduce H. pylori motility (26352). Also, there is some evidence that bismuth attenuates the development of antibiotic resistance in patients with H. pylori infection. Administering bismuth in combination with metronidazole decreases the risk of developing metronidazole resistance compared to treatment with metronidazole alone in patients with H. pylori infection (26346).\nAntidiarrheal action\nIn humans, bismuth subsalicylate appears to reduce diarrhea. While the exact mechanism of action is unclear, the effect appears to be related to the eradication of enteropathogens (such as E. coli), stimulation of fluid and electrolyte absorption, and reduction of inflammation, which is attributed to the salicylate moiety (26354, 26355, 26356).\nAntiemetic effects\nIn humans, bismuth subsalicylate has been shown to reduce nausea and vomiting caused by ipecac syrup by 66.7% and 80%, respectively (26357); the exact mechanism of action is unclear.\nAntiulcer effects\nBismuth salts have shown antiulcer effects in humans (25767, 25777). The primary mechanism of action by which bismuth salts aid in ulcer healing involves the eradication of H. pylori or other bacterial infections (25765, 25790). Bismuth salts also appear to aid in ulcer healing by functioning as mild antacids, increasing the percentage of time that gastric pH is above 3 (26344). Also, bismuth salts, such as colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol), can interact with mucus to form a glycoprotein-bismuth complex, which provides a diffusion barrier to stomach acid on the surface of the ulcer (25790). In addition, both colloidal bismuth subcitrate and bismuth subnitrate stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, which promotes ulcer healing (25790, 26344). The gastroprotective effect of colloidal bismuth subcitrate does not appear to be due to the activation of the nitric oxide system (26359). Bismuth salts do not appear to affect the height of the surface epithelium, thickness of foveolar and glandular mucosa, or the number and size of parietal cells in patients with gastric ulcers (26348).\nCoagulation effects\nIn humans, bismuth subgallate activates factor XII and accelerates the coagulation cascade (25774)."

There is interest in using bismuth nitrate to prevent free radical-induced toxicity from chemicals and ionizing radiation.\n\nFree radicals formed by ionizing radiation can cause significant tissue damage post-irradiation. Animal research shows that administering bismuth nitrate 50 mcmol/kg intraperitoneally to mice at 48 and 24 hours prior to irradiation increases metallothionein in the bone marrow and liver, reduces bone marrow damage, and increases survival at 30 days post-irradiation. Also, administering bismuth nitrate prior to 4 x 1.3 Gy of irradiation reduces the incidence of thymic lymphoma in mice; however, at 4 x 1.7 Gy, bismuth nitrate does not appear to protect against thymic lymphoma development (100541, 100546).\n\nThe synthesis of metallothionein might also protect against toxicity from various chemicals, including cadmium and cisplatin. Exposure to cadmium has been associated with vascular disease. Although research shows that bismuth nitrate can induce metallothionein synthesis in vascular endothelial cells in vitro (100542, 100543), bismuth nitrate does not appear to protect against cadmium cytotoxicity (100543). Bismuth nitrate has also been evaluated as a protective agent during cisplatin treatment. Animal research shows that treating tumor-bearing mice with bismuth nitrate subcutaneously for 2 days prior to a single intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin can reduce renal toxicity without reducing the antitumor effects of cisplatin. This renal protection is attributed to the ability of bismuth nitrate to induce the synthesis of metallothionein in the kidneys but not in the tumor tissue of mice (100544, 100549)."

Another meta-analysis, pooling the results of 7 trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, shows that bitter melon modestly reduces HbA1c by 0.3% and FBG by 14 mg/dL when compared with no treatment, but a separate analysis of 2 other trials shows that bitter melon does not improve either outcome when compared with oral antidiabetic drugs (111503). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials shows that taking bitter melon 1-6 grams daily for 4-12 weeks does not significantly improve fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (92124).\n\nSome other clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that bitter melon fruit, fruit pulp, fruit juice, and extract improve glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, reduce blood glucose levels, and lower HbA1c (34, 35, 36, 38, 12530). One clinical study shows that taking powdered bitter melon fruit 2-4 grams daily for 10 weeks lowers HbA1c similarly to glyburide 2.5 mg daily (92126).\n\nReasons for the discrepancies among the evidence are not clear but may relate to the small study sizes, shorter durations of treatment, and varying dosages and formulations of bitter melon.\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose.\nGenital herpes. Although there is interest in using topical bitter melon for genital herpes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition.\nHIV/AIDS. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that drinking a beverage containing bitter melon extract 1.25-3 grams as a single dose does not affect blood glucose or insulin response when compared with baseline (97508). A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking bitter melon (SugarKatcherS52, Kolmar BNH) 800 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces blood glucose by 22 mg/dL two hours after oral glucose tolerance test when compared with placebo, but does not improve insulin, C-peptide, or glucagon levels, nor markers of insulin resistance (112372). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups (i.e., false positive findings).\nless\nIntestinal parasite infection.

Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial for weight loss.\nA very small clinical study in patients with obesity shows that taking bitter melon 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or body fat percentage when compared to baseline. However, when compared with placebo, body weight and BMI were reduced by around 4 kg and 1.6 kg/m2, respectively. Patients in the placebo group experienced an increase in these measures (109583).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nA small preliminary clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking bitter melon 1500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces the need for rescue analgesic medications when compared with placebo. However, subjective scores of osteoarthritis symptoms improved similarly in both groups (100631).\nless\nPeptic ulcers.

The patient's symptoms, amylase levels, and lipase levels improved upon discontinuation of bitter melon and pazopanib. Pazopanib treatment was re-initiated with no further evidence of pancreatitis. Researchers theorize that inhibition of P-glycoprotein by bitter melon led to increased levels of pazopanib, a P-glycoprotein substrate, resulting in pazopanib-induced pancreatitis (109581).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of bitter melon.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of bitter melon are the fruit and seeds, and less commonly the leaves and roots (100631). Bitter melon contains alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenes, oils, steroids, sterols, polysaccharides, resins, and proteins (92129, 100630). It also contains phenolic and flavonoid compounds, and various vitamins and minerals. The immature fruit provides vitamins A and C, and also contains phosphorus and iron (92129). It also contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides, including furpyronecucubitane A, goyaglycoside I, charantagenin F, and cucurbitane triterpenoid saponins, including charantagenin E, charantosides D and E, karaviloside III, and karavilagenin B (100630). Bitter melon also contains MAP30, charantin, vicine, insulin-like peptide, alpha- and beta-momorcharin, momordicin, oleanic acids, and 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid (37, 38, 3724, 7540, 15566, 15568, 35694, 35695, 35696, 35711, 35714, 100633).\nAntineoplastic effects\nLaboratory research shows that bitter melon juice inhibits proliferation and increases necrotic cell death of gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells by targeting PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling, and enhancing autophagy (92128). This signaling is involved in developing chemoresistance. Bitter melon may also restrict energy and decrease phosphorylation of components that promote chemoresistance and anti-apoptotic effects. Other antineoplastic effects of bitter melon have been attributed to the reduced expression of growth factor receptors such as the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 (also known as neu or c-erb-2), which has been implicated in breast cancer (15568, 35696). Bitter melon might also potentiate function of natural killer cells in cancer patients (3722, 35701). In addition, 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid extracted from bitter melon seed has shown antineoplastic effects in human colon cancer cell lines and in rats (35704, 35711). Laboratory research also shows that bitter melon may inhibit RNA synthesis in human leukemic lymphocytes (35718, 35724). Additionally, MAP30, a protein isolated from bitter melon extract appears to possess anti-neoplastic effects, possibly due to reduced expression of growth factor receptors (7540, 15568, 35694, 35695, 35696).\n\nAnimal research shows that bitter melon extract reduces head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growth. This occurs via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of both proliferation of tumor cells and c-Myc expression. C-Myc is a protooncogene, and is involved in cancer cell growth and survival, and is overexpressed in various cancers. BME also modulates regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Regulatory T cells suppress anti-tumor immunity (92125).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research shows that bitter melon extract prevents lipid peroxidation and free radical generation, and scavenges free radicals (92129). Phenolic compounds present in bitter melon may be responsible for these effects.\nAntiplatelet effects\nAn in vitro study and stroke model in rats suggests that protein extracts from bitter melon may have inhibitory effects on platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation in animal tests or when compared with adenosine diphosphate during in vitro tests (112373).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research attributes bitter melon's antiviral activity to a protein called MAP30, which has been isolated from bitter melon seeds and fruit (3720, 3721, 7540, 7542, 35695). MAP30 inhibits HIV and herpes simplex viruses, including acyclovir-resistant strains (7539, 7540). It appears to inhibit HIV by inhibiting reverse transcriptase. MAP30 is also a N-glucosidase, which inhibits HIV ribosomal protein synthesis and might make viral and plasmid DNA inactive (7542, 7543). MAP30 also seems to inhibit HIV integrase, which prevents integration of viral DNA into the genetic material of healthy cells, and causes irreversible relaxation of supercoiled viral nucleic acids (7542, 35694). These changes render viruses unable to integrate into host cell genomes.\n\nAnother protein, MRK29, found in the seed and fruit of a smaller variety of bitter melon found in Thailand, appears to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and to increase tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity (7541).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animals, bitter melon may help to decrease high blood pressure through acetylcholine pathways or through reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (92129).\nFertility effects\nAnimal research shows that two proteins isolated from the raw fruit of bitter melon possess abortifacient properties (3724, 35719, 35722). In one study, the fertility rate of mice fed with daily bitter melon juice dropped from 90% to 20% (35728). Additionally, spermatogenesis was inhibited in dogs fed a bitter melon fruit extract for 60 days (35723).\nHepatoprotective effects\nBitter melon may be hepatoprotective due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (92129). In animals, bitter melon appears to improve liver enzymes after carbon tetrachloride or ammonium chloride-induced liver damage, and to increase levels of antioxidants (92129). In animals, bitter melon may also downregulate factors contributing to development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro studies suggest that karaviloside III and some other compounds in bitter melon inhibit development of hepatic fibrosis and also have activity against liver cancer cell lines (100630).\nHormonal effects\nAnimal research shows that an ethanolic extract of bitter melon seed has antispermatogenic effects and androgenic properties (7538).\nHypoglycemic effects\nBitter melon fruit, seed, and leaf extracts have demonstrated hypoglycemic activity in humans and animal models of diabetes (34, 35, 36, 3762, 3763, 3764, 3765, 7700, 8179, 15566, 92124, 92126, 92129). Preliminary evidence suggests that bitter melon decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases hepatic glycogen synthesis, increases pancreatic insulin secretion, increases peripheral glucose oxidation in erythrocytes and adipocytes, and increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (12697, 15568, 35715, 35716, 35717, 35720, 92124, 92126, 92129, 106408). Bitter melon fruit extract might also protect against hyperinsulinemia (7700). Bitter melon contains an insulin-like polypeptide called polypeptide P, plant insulin, or p-insulin. P-insulin seems to have pharmacologic effects similar to bovine insulin with an onset of action between 30 and 60 minutes, and a peak effect at about four hours (37, 38). Other components of bitter melon reported to have hypoglycemic activity are charantin, which is a mixture of two steroid glycosides, and vicine (15566, 15568, 92124). Bitter melon also seems to increase the muscle content of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4 (92126, 92129).\n\nResearch in animal models shows that an aqueous extract of bitter melon fruit can slow the progression of microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy (8179).\nHypolipidemic effects\nAnimal research shows that bitter melon can decrease triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (35703, 35705, 92129). Laboratory research shows that bitter melon decreases accumulation of lipids and inhibits preadipocyte differentiation. It also downregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which regulates adipogenesis, as well as decreases other adipogenic factors (92129). Bitter melon appears to have actions in the pancreas, liver, and fat cells (92129). It decreases ApoB secretion and alters phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. It also increases components that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy demand, leading to increased lipid metabolism and utilization. It also affects levels of mRNA of enzymes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism (35706, 35710, 92129). Flavonoids and saponins may be responsible for these effects (8180, 92129).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nConstituents of bitter melon called alpha- and beta-momorcharin have immunosuppressive activity in laboratory and animal research. They inhibit mitogenic responses of mouse splenocytes at non-cytotoxic concentrations. They also decrease the functional capacity of macrophages, as well as suppressing the cytotoxic lymphocyte response (3724).\nWeight loss effects\nIn animals with diet-induced obesity, bitter melon can reduce body weight by increasing fatty acid oxidation (92129). Polysaccharides from fermented bitter melon juice decrease body weight in rats fed a high-fat diet, and this is associated with a decrease in the size of fat cells in adipose tissue (100629). Additionally, bitter melon increases carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-1), an enzyme that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria. It also increases uncoupling proteins and expression of regulators of lipid oxidation, which suggests that bitter melon has an effect on energy expenditure. Also in animals, bitter melon lowers mRNA levels of enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis (92129)."

            "Overview": "Bitter orange is a small, flowering, fruit-bearing tree native to southeast Asia. The fruit is considered too sour to eat raw. Rather, the fruit, peel, and essential oils from the peel and flower are used for cooking, adding flavor to beer and spirits, adding aromas to perfumes, and a variety of medicinal purposes (12193, 91290).",
            "Warnings": "Since the FDA banned ephedra in 2004 due to reports of serious adverse cardiovascular effects, bitter orange has been frequently used in \"ephedra-free\" products. Synephrine, a constituent of bitter orange, is considered a banned substance by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) (13163).\n\nThe amount of synephrine and other amines in several marketed bitter orange products has been found to be higher than labeled. Additionally, some bitter orange products have been found to be adulterated with synthetic amines, including methylsynephrine and isopropyloctopamine, which are not permitted in dietary supplements (104185).",

Although single doses of synephrine, or low daily doses used short-term, may be safe in healthy adults (2040, 11269, 15381, 35757, 35759, 91681, 97256, 98332), laboratory analyses raise concerns that many marketed bitter orange products contain higher amounts of synephrine and other natural and synthetic amines than on the label, increasing the risk for serious stimulant-related adverse effects (104185). Additionally, there is a lack of agreement regarding a safe daily dose of synephrine. Health Canada has approved 50 mg of p-synephrine daily when used alone, or 40 mg of p-synephrine in combination with up to 320 mg of caffeine daily in healthy adults (91684). The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany recommends that supplements should provide no more than 6.7 mg of synephrine daily. This recommendation is meant to ensure that patients who frequently consume synephrine in conventional foods will receive no more than 25.7 mg daily (91290). These limits are intended to reduce the risk for serious adverse effects. There have been several case reports of ischemic stroke and cardiotoxicity including tachyarrhythmia, cardiac arrest, syncope, angina, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and death in otherwise healthy patients who have taken bitter orange extract alone or in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine (2040, 6979, 12030, 13039, 13067, 14326, 14342, 91680).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in the amounts found in foods.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, bitter orange might be unsafe when used in medicinal amounts. Topically and when inhaled as aromatherapy, bitter orange seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Hypertension and tachycardia, particularly when used in combination with caffeine and/or other stimulant ingredients.\n\nTopically: Skin irritation.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Myocardial infarction, QT prolongation, seizures, stroke, syncope, tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in patients taking bitter orange in combination with other ingredients. It is unclear if these effects are due to bitter orange, other ingredients, or the combination.\nCardiovascular\nBitter orange, which contains adrenergic agonists synephrine and octopamine, may cause hypertension and cardiovascular toxicity when taken orally (2040, 6969, 6979). Studies evaluating the effect of bitter orange on cardiovascular parameters have been mixed. Several studies show that taking bitter orange alone or in combination with caffeine increases blood pressure and heart rate. In one clinical study, bitter orange in combination with caffeine increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in otherwise healthy normotensive adults (13657). In another study, a single dose of bitter orange 900 mg, standardized to 6% synephrine (54 mg), also increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate for up to 5 hours in young, healthy adults (13774). Using half that dose of bitter orange and providing half as much synephrine, did not seem to significantly increase blood pressure or QT interval in healthy adults (14311). Increased diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure or heart rate also occurred in a clinical trial involving a specific supplement containing synephrine 21 mg and caffeine 304 mg (Ripped Fuel Extreme Cut, Twinlab) (35743). Synephrine given intravenously to males increased systolic blood pressure, but lacked an effect on diastolic blood pressure or heart rate (12193).\n\nIn clinical research and case reports, tachycardia, tachyarrhythmia, QT prolongation, ischemic stroke, variant angina, and myocardial infarction have occurred with use of bitter orange or synephrine-containing multi-ingredient products (12030, 13039, 13067, 13091, 13657, 14326, 35749, 91680). In one case report, a combination product containing bitter orange may have masked bradycardia and hypotension while exacerbating weight loss in a 16 year-old female with an eating disorder taking the product for weight loss (35740). From 1998 to 2004, Health Canada received 16 reports of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions such as tachycardia, cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, blackout, and collapse. In two of these cases, the patient died. In almost all of these cases, bitter orange was combined with another stimulant such as caffeine, ephedrine, or both (14342).\n\nOther research has found no significant effect of bitter orange on blood pressure or heart rate. Several clinical studies have reported that, when taken as a single dose or in divided doses ranging from 20-100 mg for one day, p-synephrine had no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram results or adverse cardiovascular events in healthy adults (35772, 91681, 91681, 95659, 101708) Similarly, no difference in blood pressure, heart rate or electrocardiogram results were reported when p-synephrine from bitter orange (Advantra Z/Kinetic; Nutratech/Novel Ingredients Inc.) was taken for 6 weeks in healthy patients (11268). Another clinical study showed no significant effect of bitter orange (Nutratech Inc.), standardized to synephrine 20 mg, on blood pressure or heart rate when taken daily for 8 weeks in healthy males (95656). In other research, changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or QTc interval were lacking when bitter orange was given alone or in combination with caffeine and green tea (14311, 35753, 35755, 35764, 35769, 35770). In one study of healthy adults, taking a single dose of p-synephrine 103 mg actually reduced mean diastolic blood pressure by 0.4-4 mmHg at 1 and 2 hours after administration when compared with placebo (95659).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults with or without obesity suggests that taking p-synephrine 6-214 mg orally daily does not affect blood pressure or heart rate when used short-term, but modestly increases blood pressure and heart rate when taken for 56-60 days (109950).\n\nThe effect of bitter orange on blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram results in patients with underlying conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, is unknown and requires further study.\nless\nDermatologic\nPhotosensitivity may occur, particularly in fair-skinned people (11909). In a clinical trial, topical application with bitter orange essential oil resulted in irritation (6972).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome clinical research shows that taking a specific supplement containing 21 mg of synephrine and 304 mg of caffeine (Ripped Fuel Extreme Cut, Twinlab) increases levels of postprandial glucose (35743). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific pre-workout supplement (Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout, Nutrabolt) along with a bitter orange extract standardized for synephrine 20 mg (Nutratech Inc.) 30 minutes once before exercise causes a significant 12% increase in glucose (95657); however, there is no difference in blood glucose when compared with placebo when this combination is taken daily for 8 weeks (95656). The effect of bitter orange itself is unclear.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nBitter orange has been linked to a report of ischemic colitis. In one case, a 52-year-old female developed ischemic colitis after taking a bitter orange-containing supplement (NaturalMax Skinny Fast, Nutraceutical Corporation) for a week. Symptoms resolved within 48 hours after discontinuing the supplement (15186). As this product contains various ingredients, the effect of bitter orange itself is unclear.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nUnsteady gait has been noted in one case report of a patient taking bitter orange (13091). In another case, an otherwise healthy, Black male with sickle cell trait, developed severe rhabdomyolysis following ingestion of a specific weight loss product (Lipo 6, Nutrex Research Inc.), which contained synephrine and caffeine (16054). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific pre-workout supplement (Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout, Nutrabolt) along with a bitter orange extract standardized for synephrine 20 mg (Nutratech Inc.), taken 30 minutes once before exercise (95657) or daily for 8 weeks, does not affect creatine kinase or serum creatinine levels when compared with placebo (95656). As these products contain various ingredients, the effect of bitter orange itself is unclear.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nDizziness, difficulty in concentrating, memory loss, syncope, seizure, and stroke have been noted in case reports following bitter orange administration (13091, 13039). Theoretically, bitter orange may trigger a migraine or cluster headache due to its synephrine and octopamine content (35768). When used as aromatherapy, bitter orange essential oil has also been reported to cause headache in some patients (104187). Sprint athletes taking the bitter orange constituent p-synephrine 3 mg/kg (Synephrine HCL 99%, Nutrition Power) 60 minutes before exercises and sprinting reported more nervousness (mean difference 0.9) when compared with placebo on a Likert scale. Although statistically significant, this difference is not considered clinically significant (95655).\nless",

Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nAndrogenic alopecia. Although there has been interest in using topical bitter orange for androgenic alopecia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral bitter orange or aromatherapy with bitter orange is beneficial in patients with anxiety.\nAromatherapy with bitter orange has been evaluated for anxiety in hospitalized or recently hospitalized patients. A clinical study in conscious patients admitted to the intensive care unit shows that inhaling bitter orange as aromatherapy for 30 minutes is associated with lower anxiety scores immediately and 3 hours after the intervention, but not at 1 hour after, when compared with placebo. It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups; baseline anxiety scores were significantly higher in the placebo group (108752). Another clinical study in adults with acute coronary syndrome shows that aromatherapy with bitter orange essential oil 30% for the 2 days immediately after hospitalization improves anxiety scores by 19%, compared with a 6% improvement in those inhaling placebo (101710).\n\nOral bitter orange has also been evaluated in patients with anxiety. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with moderate anxiety shows that taking dried bitter orange flower powder 500 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks reduces anxiety symptoms by about 4% when compared with placebo, as measured on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (97256). However, this improvement is not likely to be considered clinically significant.\nless\nAthletic performance. Several small, short-term clinical studies suggest that oral bitter orange does not improve athletic performance, although some conflicting findings exist.\nOne small clinical study in young males who were former athletes shows that taking 100 mg of p-synephrine from bitter orange extract (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc.), with or without caffeine 100 mg, daily for 4 days increases the number of total repetitions and volume load by 11% during resistance squat exercise performance when compared with placebo. However, there was no difference in ratings of perceived exertion, and only the p-synephrine plus caffeine group showed an increase in mean power and velocity measures (95683). Other small studies have failed to show a benefit, with or without caffeine. One small study of physically active males with habitual caffeine use shows that taking caffeine 100 mg and bitter orange 100 mg once before exercise does not affect peak power, mean power, total work, or perceived effort or fatigue when compared with placebo (101709). Another small clinical study shows that taking p-synephrine (Synephrine HCL 99%, Nutrition Power) 3 mg/kg orally 60 minutes before exercise does not improve jump tests, 60-meter sprints, or 100-meter sprints in healthy sprint athletes (95655). A small clinical study shows that taking a specific caffeine-containing pre-workout supplement (Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout, Nutrabolt) along with bitter orange extract (Nutratech Inc.) as a single dose 30 minutes before exercise does not improve athletic performance during anaerobic cycling or leg and bench press exercises (95657). Also, taking this combination daily for 8 weeks does not improve strength or body composition when compared with placebo (95656).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange to prevent cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD).

Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nDiabetes. Oral bitter orange has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that drinking a tea made from the leaves of Indian snakeroot and the fruit of bitter orange for 4 months decreases fasting and postprandial glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels when compared with placebo (35751). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to bitter orange, Indian snakeroot, or the combination.\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral bitter orange is beneficial in patients with dyspepsia.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with functional dyspepsia shows that taking a specific product containing bitter orange in combination with other ingredients (Zhizhu) three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms of functional dyspepsia in 67% of patients, compared with 45% of patients taking a similar product containing sweet orange instead of bitter orange (35757).\nless\nFatigue.

Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if using bitter orange aromatherapy for sleep disturbances is beneficial in postmenopausal or pregnant adults.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with sleep disturbances shows that inhaling essential oil of bitter orange 10% as aromatherapy for 5 minutes twice daily for 4 consecutive days each week for 4 weeks does not improve sleep quality when compared with odorless sweet almond oil (108642). Other clinical research in pregnant adults with sleep disturbances shows that inhaling bitter orange essential oil as aromatherapy for 20 minutes twice daily for 1 month improves sleep scores, including sleep duration, latency, and efficiency, when compared with sweet almond oil (110043).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral bitter orange, or its constituent p-synephrine, is beneficial for obesity.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults with or without obesity shows that taking p-synephrine, a constituent of bitter orange, 6-214 mg orally daily for up to 8 weeks does not reduce body weight or fat mass, or alter blood glucose levels, when compared with placebo (109950).\n\nBitter orange has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical trial in overweight adults shows that taking a combination of bitter orange 975 mg, caffeine 528 mg, and St. John's wort 900 mg daily along with calorie restriction and exercise reduces body weight when compared with caloric restriction and exercise alone (11268). Another small clinical study in overweight adults shows that taking a specific combination product (Prograde Metabolism, Prograde Nutrition) containing bitter orange, raspberry ketone, caffeine, capsaicin, garlic, ginger, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and chromium along with diet and exercise for 8 weeks reduces body weight, fat mass, and hip and waist girth and increases lean body mass and energy levels when compared with placebo (91291). However, a small clinical trial in overweight and obese adults shows that taking a different combination product (Charge, Labrada), containing bitter orange 150 mg, providing 9 mg synephrine, plus caffeine and several other ingredients twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight (15381). The effects of bitter orange alone on body weight are unclear.\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if aromatherapy with bitter orange essential oil is beneficial in hospitalized patients with pain.\nOne small clinical trial in conscious patients in intensive care units shows that aromatherapy with bitter orange essential oil for 30 minutes does not reduce pain when compared with placebo (104187).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if aromatherapy with bitter orange essential oil is beneficial in patients with PMS.\nOne small clinical trial in healthy female students with PMS shows that inhaling bitter orange blossom 0.5% essential oil as aromatherapy for 5 minutes twice daily for 5 days, starting about one week before menstruation and repeating for two menstrual cycles, improves psychological but not physical symptoms of PMS when compared with aromatherapy with odorless sweet almond oil (98331).\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. It is unclear if oral bitter orange or aromatherapy with bitter orange is beneficial for reducing anxiety before surgery.\nOne small clinical study in patients undergoing minor operations shows that taking bitter orange blossom distillate 1 mL/kg two hours prior to surgery reduces preoperative anxiety when compared to baseline. No significant improvements in anxiety were reported in patients taking placebo before surgery (35759). Another small clinical study in patients undergoing coronary angiography shows that inhaling bitter orange essential oil for 15-20 minutes about one hour prior to the procedure reduces anxiety when compared with placebo (104186).\nless\nPressure ulcers. Although there has been interest in using topical bitter orange for pressure ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Although there has been interest in using oral bitter orange for rhinosinusitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter orange for this purpose.\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if topical bitter orange oil is beneficial in postmenopausal adults with sexual dysfunction.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with sexual dysfunction shows that inhaling bitter orange essential oil 10% as aromatherapy for 5 minutes twice daily, 4 days per week for 4 weeks, improves sexual dysfunction scores by 58% when compared with almond oil. Patients reported improvements in the domains of desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction (110042).\nless\nTinea corporis. It is unclear if topical bitter orange oil is beneficial in patients with tinea corporis.\nIn one small clinical study of patients with either tinea corporis, tina cruris, or tinea pedis, 80% of patients applying a bitter orange oil 25% emulsion three times daily experienced a cure within 1-2 weeks, and 20% experienced a cure within 2-3 weeks. For those applying a solution of bitter orange oil 20% in alcohol, 50% experienced a cure in 1-2 weeks, 30% in 2-3 weeks, and 20% in 3-4 weeks (6972).

These preparations are often promoted for weight loss due to purported thermogenic effects (4800). Fresh bitter orange fruit contains approximately 0.02% synephrine (11267). The concentration tends to be lower in larger fruits and higher in smaller fruits. In freshly-squeezed juice, the synephrine concentration ranges from 20-57 mcg/mL (2040, 12193, 91682, 91683). Drying the fruit seems to increase synephrine concentrations to approximately 0.35%. Dried extracts contain approximately 3% synephrine. Octopamine levels are much lower, usually less than 0.03% (11267).\n\nA specific bitter orange extract containing 900 mg of bitter orange (Nature's Way) is standardized to 6% synephrine (54 mg of p-synephrine) (35763). Another specific bitter orange supplement (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc.) is standardized to contain 60% p-synephrine (35755).\n\nA bitter orange blossom distillate was standardized to contain 0.01 mg/mL of linalool, 33 mg/mL (equal to gallic acid) of total phenolic compounds and 29 mg/mL (equal to rutin) of total flavonoids (35759).\n\nA laboratory analysis shows that many marketed bitter orange products contain higher amounts of amines, including synephrine, octopamine, and hordenine, than labeled. Only 22% of products in this study had synephrine content within 20% of the labeled amount. Additionally, this analysis found that some bitter orange products contain methylsynephrine and isopropyloctopamine, which are synthetic amines not permitted in dietary supplements (104185).",

However, the extent of the effect of bitter orange on CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions is unknown. Some evidence suggests that bitter orange selectively inhibits intestinal CYP3A4, but not hepatic CYP3A4. Its effect on P-glycoprotein, which strongly overlaps with CYP3A4 interactions, is unclear (7029, 11269, 11270, 11362).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of bitter orange are the peel, flower, leaf, and fruit. Bitter orange has numerous active constituents and pharmacological effects; however, the amount of each constituent can vary depending on the plant part and preparation method used. The flavonoid content of bitter orange is higher in the flowers than the leaves (6971). Flavonoids are also present in the peel. These flavonoids include limonene, hesperidin, neohesperidin, naringin, and tangaretin (12193). Bitter orange also contains the furocoumarins bergapten and oxypeucedanin (7029, 11019, 11269). The fruit and peel of bitter orange contain the adrenergic agonists synephrine and octopamine (2080, 4800, 11267, 35776); these molecules are usually cited on product labels as \"active ingredients.\" Synephrine is structurally similar to epinephrine. Octopamine is similar to norepinephrine (11995, 12193, 12378). Synephrine and octopamine naturally occur in the human body. Trace amounts are part of the pool of circulating amines in humans (12379). In the body, tyramine is converted to octopamine, which then gets converted to synephrine (12193). Like tyramine, octopamine and synephrine are substrates of monoamine oxidase (11995, 12378). The exact physiological function of octopamine and synephrine is unclear. They were once referred to as \"false neurotransmitters,\" but it is now thought that they might act as true neurotransmitters (12193). There are at least 6 isomers of synephrine. Different isomers of synephrine can have somewhat different pharmacological effects. It is unclear which isomer or isomers are contained in bitter orange. Some references suggest that bitter orange contains only p-synephrine. Other references suggest that it contains only m-synephrine, which is also known as phenylephrine. Phenylephrine (m-synephrine) is the alpha-adrenergic agent used as an over-the-counter nasal decongestant (Neosynephrine). Some bitter orange product labels indicate that the product contains both p-synephrine and m-synephrine. In laboratory analysis, both of these isomers have been detected in at least one commercial bitter orange product (13136). But it is unknown if this commercial bitter orange product may be spiked with one or more synthetic synephrine isomers. More research is needed to determine which isomer(s) of synephrine occur naturally in bitter orange extracts in order to better understand the pharmacological effects of bitter orange products.\nAdrenergic effects\nSimilar to ephedra, Citrus aurantium contains alkaloids that may have adrenergic agonist effects and is often incorporated into supplements claimed to aid in weight loss (35736). Bitter orange peel seems to have beta-1 adrenergic activity (13657). Both synephrine and octopamine are selective beta-3 adrenoreceptor agonists. Synephrine also appears to be an alpha-1 agonist. Octopamine appears to also affect alpha-2 receptors (12193). P-synephrine occurs naturally in the human body in small quantities and may act as a neurotransmitter (12376). P-synephrine is usually indicated under the name oxedrine. Oxedrine is thought to be the primary ingredient in Citrus aurantium that produces weight loss, although it has not been firmly established.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBitter orange peel may have anti-inflammatory activity, which might be due to the flavonoids naringin and nobiletin (1281).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn human research, a tea containing Rauwolfia vomitoria and bitter orange fruit reduced two-hour postprandial glucose and HbA1c (35751).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that the bitter orange constituents auraptene, marmin, tangeretin, nobiretin, and a psoralen compound might have antitumor effects (6974).\n\nThere is also interest in bitter orange flavonoids for preventing progression of osteosarcoma. In vitro evidence suggests that the bitter orange flavonoid naringenin inhibits growth of the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line, while the flavonoids naringin and hesperetin had no effect. In a follow-up clinical study, taking naringenin 20 mg daily for 2 years reduced the rates of local osteosarcoma recurrence when compared with placebo. Post-mortem analysis of 5 patients that died in the clinical study of 95 patients, suggests that taking naringenin does not affect metastasis of osteosarcoma but is associated with a smaller tumor mass when compared with placebo (98333).\nAntiviral effects\nTwo flavonoids of the bitter orange fruit, neohesperidin and hesperidin, seem to have antiviral activity against rotavirus infection (6976).\nCardiovascular effects\nBitter orange and stimulant constituents such as synephrine and octopamine might increase heart rate and blood pressure. In animal research, bitter orange caused vasoconstriction and increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), but reduced portal pressure (6975). Preliminary clinical research suggests that bitter orange plus a synthetic preparation of the active components synephrine and N-methyltyramine may be used successfully to treat infectious shock. N-methyltyramine seems to increase blood pressure by increasing norepinephrine release (6978).\nErgogenic effects\nThere is interest in using bitter orange to improve athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in healthy males shows that taking bitter orange 600 mg, standardized to contain 180 mg of p-synephrine, orally 90 minutes before moderate treadmill exercise modestly improves heart rate variability and recovery of systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (109949). However, overall, clinical research has found conflicting effects on athletic performance measures such as strength, power, perceived effort, and fatigue (95655, 95656, 95683, 101709).\nInsecticidal effects\nIn vitro research suggests that bitter orange peel oil may have insecticidal activity (6973).\nMetabolic effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that adrenergic amines extracted from bitter orange can increase the thermic effect of food, especially in females (35739). Other clinical research shows that taking a specific combination supplement containing bitter orange (6 mg synephrine), green tea, guarana, grape seed extract, ginger, and other ingredients (Xenadrine-EFX; Cytodyne Technologies, Inc.) does not improve ATP utilization at rest or after exercise (91647).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nAlthough bitter orange is often included in muscle development products, preliminary research suggests bitter orange does not affect muscle precursor cells called satellite cells, which are thought to cause muscular hypertrophy (13773).\nNeurologic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that synephrine may have antidepressant effects, possibly by promoting norepinephrine release (12376, 12377).\nPhotosensitizing effects\nBitter orange contains furocoumarins. The furocoumarins bergapten and oxypeucedanin in bitter orange oil are photosensitizing (11019).\nWeight loss effects\nThe weight loss effects of p-synephrine may be due to increased resting energy expenditure and metabolic rate, involving its binding to beta-3 adrenergic receptors, involved in fat breakdown and oxidation (35763). In an animal toxicity study, p-synephrine resulted in a decrease in body weight gain (35747). In healthy adults, taking p-synephrine 3 mg/kg increased whole-body fat oxidation during prolonged and constant-intensity exercise, although it did not increase energy expenditure (101708). Additionally, octopamine and synephrine might have a role in fat cell lipolysis. Octopamine seems to have an insulin-like effect on glucose uptake by fat cells (11995)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Black cohosh is a perennial herb that grows in woodland areas. It reaches up to 3 meters in height and is native to eastern North America (35789). The rhizome and root are used for medicinal purposes (9997, 35827). Black cohosh has been used medicinally by native Americans and in Germany since the late 19th century (141, 9997).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Black cohosh has been safely used in some studies lasting up to a year (15036, 15158, 17091, 19553, 35908); however, most studies have lasted only up to 6 months (141, 4614, 4620, 7054, 9437, 9494, 13143, 13184, 14330, 14423)(14424, 15037, 15889, 15893, 35824, 35852, 35853, 35858, 35865, 35897)(35902, 35904, 35946, 35964, 95525, 103269). There is concern that black cohosh might cause liver damage in some patients. Several case reports link black cohosh to liver failure or autoimmune hepatitis (4383, 10692, 11906, 12006, 13144, 14469, 15160, 16721, 16722, 16723)(16724, 16725, 16726, 16727, 35857, 107906).

Until more is known, monitor liver function in patients who take black cohosh.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in pregnant patients who are not at term.

Black cohosh might have hormonal effects. Theoretically, maternal intake of black cohosh might adversely affect a nursing child (15035). Until more is known, nursing patients should avoid taking black cohosh.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, black cohosh is generally well tolerated when used in typical doses.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Breast tenderness, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset, headache, irritability, rash, tiredness.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Endometrial hyperplasia and hepatotoxicity, although data are conflicting for both.\nCardiovascular\nA single case of reversible bradycardia has been reported for a 59-year-old female who took one tablet of a specific black cohosh product (Remifemin, Schaper & Brümmer) daily for 2 weeks. The adverse event was considered probably related to black cohosh use, although the exact mechanism by which black cohosh exerted this effect was unclear (35920).\n\nThere has been concern that, if black cohosh has estrogen-like effects, it could also potentially cause estrogen-like side effects including increased risk for thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease. These outcomes have not been specifically assessed in long-term trials; however, some research shows that a specific black cohosh extract (CimiPure, PureWorld) does not significantly affect surrogate markers for thromboembolism and cardiovascular risk such as fibrinogen, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or insulin levels compared to placebo (16850).\nless\nDermatologic\nBlack cohosh has been associated with skin irritation and rashes (7054, 10987, 14330, 15889, 35853). A case report describes a patient who developed cutaneous pseudolymphoma 6 months after starting a specific black cohosh extract (Remifemin). Symptoms resolved within 12 weeks of discontinuing black cohosh (15890).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, black cohosh can commonly cause gastrointestinal upset (4383, 4615, 4616, 10988, 13184, 35824, 35853, 35965, 103269, 111714). Constipation and indigestion have also been reported (7054, 35852).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, black cohosh, including the specific black cohosh product Remifemin, may cause vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness in some postmenopausal patients (15889, 35824). However, the frequency of these events seems to be less than that of tibolone, a prescription hormone medication used to treat symptoms of menopause (15889, 35904).\n\nDue to the potential estrogen-like effects, there is concern that black cohosh might increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. However, a specific black cohosh extract CR BNO 1055 (Klimadynon/Menofem, Bionorica AG) does not appear to cause endometrial hyperplasia. Clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking 40 mg daily of this extract for 12 weeks does not significantly increase superficial cells when compared with placebo, and causes significantly fewer superficial cells when compared with conjugated estrogens (Premarin) (14330). Additional clinical research shows that taking 40 mg daily of this extract for a year does not increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial thickening in postmenopausal adults (15036). Another specific combination product containing black cohosh extract plus St. John's wort (Gynoplus, Jin-Yang Pharm) also does not significantly increase superficial cells compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (15893). Some patients taking tamoxifen plus black cohosh have experienced endometrial hyperplasia and vaginal bleeding. However, these effects are more likely due to tamoxifen than black cohosh (7054).\nless\nHepatic\nThere is concern that black cohosh might cause liver disease, hepatotoxicity, or hepatitis. Adverse effects on the liver have not been documented in clinical studies. However, multiple case reports of liver toxicity, hepatitis, and abnormal liver function have been described in females taking black cohosh products alone or in combination with other herbs or drugs. In some cases, patients developed liver failure and required immediate liver transplantation (4383, 10692, 11909, 12006, 13144, 14469, 15160, 16721, 16722, 16723) (16724, 16727, 35883, 35888, 35890, 35895, 89465, 101592, 107906). In one case, a female developed autoimmune hepatitis after 3 weeks of taking black cohosh. Symptoms resolved 2 weeks after discontinuing black cohosh (11906). In at least three cases, females have developed elevated liver enzymes and symptoms of hepatotoxicity after taking black cohosh products. Symptoms resolved and liver enzymes normalized within a week of discontinuing black cohosh (16725, 16726). Analysis of two liver biopsies suggests that hepatotoxicity associated with black cohosh use results from the accumulation of 4HNE protein adducts in the cytoplasm of liver cells, which promotes the migration of lymphocytes to the affected area and induces an autoimmune response leading to troxis necrosis (89469).\n\nHowever, many of these cases are poorly documented. Causality is possible based on some reports; however, other reports do not indicate that black cohosh is the probable cause of the events (15891, 15892, 16722, 16723, 16727, 89465). Hepatitis can occur with no identifiable cause, raising the possibility that black cohosh and hepatitis might have been coincidental in some cases. Also, plant misidentification can occur, resulting in accidental substitution of a hepatotoxic plant (11910). Therefore, some experts argue that these cases do not provide conclusive evidence that black cohosh is responsible for liver disease (17085, 35882, 111634). Nonetheless, some countries require cautionary labeling on black cohosh products suggesting a risk of liver toxicity. The United States Pharmacopeia also recommends cautionary labeling on black cohosh products (16722). Until more is known about this potential risk, consider monitoring liver function in patients who take black cohosh.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOne patient treated with black cohosh in a clinical trial discontinued treatment due to edema and arthralgia (35897).\n\nBlack cohosh has been linked to asthenia, muscle damage, and rhabdomyolysis (14299, 116172). In one case, a 54-year-old female experienced asthenia with elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels while taking black cohosh. The patient had taken a specific black cohosh extract (Remifemin) for 1 year, discontinued it for 2 months, restarted it, and then experienced symptoms 2 months later. Symptoms began to resolve 10 days after discontinuing black cohosh (14299). Another case report describes serotonin syndrome and rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatinine kinase in a 55-year-old female taking black cohosh along with sertraline, duloxetine, and rosuvastatin (116172).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, black cohosh may cause headache, dizziness, or tiredness (35852, 35886). There is one case report of seizures in a female who used black cohosh, evening primrose oil, and chasteberry (10988). A separate case report describes a 55-year-old female who experienced serotonin syndrome after the addition of black cohosh extract 40 mg daily to longstanding treatment with duloxetine 60 mg and sertraline 50 mg daily (116172).\n\nIn one case, an infant experienced severe complications, including seizures, renal failure, and respiratory distress, after maternal ingestion of an unknown dose of black cohosh and blue cohosh at 42 weeks' gestation to induce labor (9492, 9493). However, this adverse effect may have been attributable to blue cohosh, which has been associated with infant toxicity in multiple cases.\n\nIn another case report, orobuccolingual dyskinesia, including tongue-biting, eating difficulties, and speech problems, was reported in a 46-year-old female who took two tablets containing black cohosh 20 mg and Panax ginseng 50 mg daily for 15 months. The patient's condition improved after stopping treatment with the herbs and taking clonazepam 2 mg daily with baclofen 40 mg daily (89735).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nThere is some concern that black cohosh might increase the risk of retinal vein thrombosis due to its estrogenic activity. In one case, a patient with protein S deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experienced retinal vein thrombosis 3 days after taking a combination product containing black cohosh 250 mg, red clover 250 mg, dong quai 100 mg, and wild yam 276 mg (13155). It is unclear if this event was due to black cohosh, other ingredients, the combination, or another factor.\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that black cohosh may affect hormone-sensitive cancers, such as some types of breast or uterine cancer, due to its potential estrogenic effects. However, evidence from a cohort study suggests that regular use of black cohosh is not associated with the risk of breast or endometrial cancer (17412, 111634).\nless\nPsychiatric\nA 36-year-old female with a 15-year history of depression developed mania with psychotic and mixed features after taking a black cohosh extract 40 mg daily. The patient gradually recovered after stopping black cohosh and receiving treatment with antipsychotics (104517).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nThere has been a case report of severe complications, including seizures, renal failure, and respiratory distress, in an infant whose mother was given an unknown dose of black cohosh and blue cohosh at 42 weeks gestation to induce labor (1122, 9492, 9493). However, this adverse effect may have been attributable to blue cohosh.\nless\nRenal\nThere has been a case report of severe complications, including seizures, renal failure, and respiratory distress, in an infant whose mother was given an unknown dose of black cohosh and blue cohosh at 42 weeks gestation to induce labor (1122, 9492, 9493). However, this adverse effect may have been attributable to blue cohosh.\nless\nOther\nWhile rare, weight gain has been reported in some patients taking black cohosh. However, in most cases the causality could not be established. A review of the literature, including published case reports, spontaneous reports to adverse event databases, and clinical trials, suggests that black cohosh does not cause weight gain (107907).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral black cohosh seems to modestly improve some physical symptoms of menopause, but it is unclear if black cohosh improves mood-related symptoms.\nA meta-analysis of 22 studies in adults with menopause shows that taking black cohosh extract alone or in combination with other herbal medicines for 4-52 weeks improves overall menopausal symptoms, hot flashes, and somatic symptoms but not anxiety or depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (111659). Meta-analyses of 20 clinical trials that assessed black cohosh shows that overall black cohosh is not superior to placebo and is inferior to hormonal therapy for reducing hot flash frequency and symptoms of menopause (89467, 92661).\n\nThe most consistent evidence is for a specific isopropanolic extract of black cohosh (Remifemin, Phytopharmica/Enzymatic Therapy). When taken in doses of 40-127 mg daily for up to 12 weeks it reduces menopausal symptoms and hot flash frequency when compared with placebo (9437, 13143, 13184, 14423, 15889, 35824, 35853, 35904, 35964). It also seems to be comparable to hormonal therapy, including low-dose transdermal estradiol (Estraderm) 25 mcg every 7 days (13184), tibolone 2.5 mg daily (15889, 35904), or conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) 0.625 mg daily (35964). Additionally, the Spanish Menopause Society (AEEM) states that most current evidence shows that this specific black cohosh extract, at a dose of 40 mg daily, is most effective at improving mood and treating vasomotor symptoms such as reducing night sweats and hot flushes, particularly in those with intense hot flushes. In women with natural menopause, taking this extract at a dose of 8-128 mg for 3-6 months treats vasomotor symptoms more effectively than placebo and similarly to low-dose transdermal estrogen or tibolone. Additionally, black cohosh improves depression, anxiety, sleep quality, vaginal atrophy, and bone metabolism but does not seem to clinically impact endometrium thickness, cognitive function, skin, or lipid profiles (111634).\n\nResearch using other formulations of black cohosh is less consistent. One commercial black cohosh extract CR BNO 1055 (Klimadynon/Menofem, Bionorica AG) 40 mg daily in 1-2 divided doses for 60-90 days does not reduce menopausal symptoms when compared with control groups (10987, 13169, 35908). Other clinical research shows that taking a different commercial black cohosh extract (Remixin, Mikro-Gen) 40 mg daily for 6 months reduces hot flashes and night sweats when compared with fluoxetine 20 mg daily (35852). However, the high dropout rate and lack of placebo group limit the reliability of these findings.\n\nStudies using non-commercial black cohosh extracts have been mostly negative. In one study, taking a black cohosh extract 6.5 mg daily for 12 weeks did not reduce hot flashes or symptom rating scores when compared with placebo; however, a subgroup of patients with at least moderate symptoms appeared to have improvement in some symptoms (14424). In another study, taking black cohosh ethanolic extract 160 mg daily did not reduce frequency of hot flashes or other vasomotor symptoms after 12 months of treatment (15158). Taking another black cohosh extract 128 mg daily for 12 months was significantly less effective than conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) in reducing hot flashes and night sweats, and was also less effective than placebo at some time points during the study (17091).\n\nBlack cohosh has also been evaluated in patients with cancer treatment-induced menopausal symptoms. A small observational study in adults with menopausal symptoms secondary to tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer suggests that taking a dry extract of black cohosh 20 mg improves climacteric symptoms when compared with placebo (111635). The validity of these effects is limited by a small sample size and lack of a comparator group.\n\nPreliminary clinical trials have also evaluated black cohosh in combination with numerous other herbal ingredients (15037, 15893, 19552, 35853, 53707, 103269). Several trials have shown a benefit with some combinations when compared with baseline or placebo, but these combinations have not been compared with black cohosh alone. It is unclear whether the effects are due to black cohosh, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there has been interest in using topical black cohosh for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nAnxiety. Black cohosh does not appear to be effective for treating anxiety in postmenopausal patients.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal patients shows that taking a black cohosh extract, 64 mg daily for 2 weeks, then gradually increasing to 128 mg daily for a total of 12 weeks, does not improve anxiety as measured on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAM-A) scale, when compared with placebo (35897).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral black cohosh is beneficial for breast cancer treatment or prevention.\nOne observational study suggests that the use of black cohosh supplements is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (35841); however, other population-based studies found no difference (17412, 35896). In females diagnosed with breast cancer, one observational study found that black cohosh extract was associated with prolonged disease-free survival (35845). A small observational study in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) suggests that taking isopropanolic black cohosh extract 20 mg twice daily for 2-6 weeks prior to breast surgery does not impact breast cancer cellular proliferation, tumor volume, invasive disease upgrade rates, or hormone levels including estradiol, and follicle-stimulating hormone when compared to baseline (111714). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. Evidence for the use of oral black cohosh for hot flashes associated with breast cancer is conflicting.\nPreliminary open-label trials show that taking black cohosh extracts can reduce hot flashes in females with a history of breast cancer (13169, 14423). However, higher-quality randomized controlled trials show that black cohosh does not reduce hot flashes in these patients (7054, 15161).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral black cohosh reduces the risk of CVD.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking a specific black cohosh extract called CR BNO 1055 (Klimadynon Uno, Bionorica) 40 mg daily, in conjunction with endurance exercise, for 10 weeks does not reduce cardiovascular disease risk measured by the Framingham Risk score when compared with endurance exercise or light exercise alone (35908).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral black cohosh is beneficial for improving cognitive function in postmenopausal patients.\nIn one preliminary clinical trial, taking a black cohosh extract 128 mg daily for 12 months did not significantly improve performance on memory and attention tests when compared with placebo in postmenopausal patients (19553).\nless\nCough. Although there has been interest in using oral black cohosh for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral black cohosh for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral black cohosh is beneficial for female infertility.\nOne small clinical study in patients with unexplained infertility shows that taking black cohosh rhizome dry extract (Klimadynon, Bionorica) 120 mg on days 1-12 of the menstrual cycle, plus clomiphene citrate 150 mg daily on days 3-7, increases the pregnancy rate by 23% when compared with clomiphene citrate alone (35858). Another small clinical study in patients with unexplained infertility shows that taking black cohosh (Klimadynon, Bionorica) 120 mg plus clomiphene citrate 150 mg results in similar pregnancy rates when compared with ethinyl estradiol 100 mcg plus clomiphene citrate (35902).\nless\nInsect repellent. Although there has been interest in using topical black cohosh as an insect repellent, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nMigraine headache. Oral black cohosh has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn one preliminary clinical trial, taking one tablet of a phytoestrogen formulation containing black cohosh extract 25 mg, soy extract 75 mg, and dong quai extract 50 mg twice daily for 24 weeks reduced the frequency of menstrual migraines when compared with placebo (35797).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral black cohosh has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product containing black cohosh 35 mg per tablet, with white willow bark, sarsaparilla, poplar bark, and guaiacum resin (Reumalex, Gerard House Ltd.), two tablets daily for 2 months improves pain when compared with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis. However, no improvement in joint function was found (35946).\nless\nOsteoporosis. There is contradictory evidence on the benefit of black cohosh for osteoporosis treatment or prevention.\nIn one preliminary clinical trial, postmenopausal patients taking specific black cohosh products (Klimadynon/Menofem, Bionorica AG; Remifemin, Schaper & Brümmer) 40 mg daily for 12 weeks had increased levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), which is a marker of bone formation (14330, 35865). However, in another clinical trial, bone mineral density was no different in patients taking a specific black cohosh extract (Klimadynon/Klimadynon Uno/Menofem, Bionorica) 40 mg daily for 12 months when compared with two control groups (35908). It is not known if these black cohosh products can decrease the risk of fracture.\nless\nParturition. It is unclear whether oral black cohosh is beneficial or safe for labor induction.\nIt has been reported that as many as 45% of nurse-midwives have used black cohosh to induce labor in pregnant adults at term (1122). However, there is no reliable clinical evidence that black cohosh is safe or effective for this use (15035).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral black cohosh is beneficial for improving fertility in patients with PCOS.\nA small clinical study in patients with PCOS and a history of infertility shows that taking black cohosh 10 mg twice daily for 10 days along with clomiphene citrate 50 mg twice daily for 5 days, both starting on the second day of the menstrual cycle, does not increase endometrial thickness or the size or number of mature follicles when compared with clomiphene citrate alone (107905). Pregnancy and live birth rates were not evaluated in this study.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there has been interest in using oral black cohosh for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral black cohosh has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with RA shows that taking a specific combination product containing black cohosh 35 mg per tablet, with white willow bark, sarsaparilla, poplar bark, and guaiacum resin (Reumalex, Gerard House Ltd.) two tablets daily for 2 months improves pain when compared with placebo. However, no improvement in joint function was observed (35946).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral black cohosh is beneficial for improving sexual dysfunction.\nA small observational study in adults with breast cancer on tamoxifen suggests that taking a dry extract of black cohosh 20 mg is associated with improvements in sexual response scores, which include sexual parameters such as desire, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain but not arousal when compared to baseline (111635). The validity of these effects is limited by a small sample size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nWarts. Although there has been interest in using topical black cohosh for warts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black cohosh for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate black cohosh for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBlack cohosh extract is most often standardized to triterpene glycoside content. Many clinical studies have evaluated a specific black cohosh isopropanolic extract (Remifemin, Schaper & Brümmer GmbH & Co. KG) standardized to contain 1 mg triterpene glycosides, calculated as 27-deoxyactein, per 20 mg tablet. Most studies used doses of 40 mg daily (9437, 13143, 13184, 14423, 15889, 35824, 35853, 35904). In one study, the black cohosh extract used was standardized to contain 5.6% triterpene glycosides (R-actein, S-actein, 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, and 26-deoxyactein) (35897).\n\nSome products labeled as black cohosh contain Actaea species other than Actaea racemosa. Also, products containing the correct Actaea racemosa species have significant variability in the amount of active constituents they contain, such as triterpene glycosides (14421). There has also been concern that some black cohosh products contain high levels of heavy metals (35893).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nIn menopausal adults, taking a 75% ethanol extract of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, a constituent of black cohosh, at gradually increasing doses of 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mg results in proportionate increases in the area under the concentration-time curve (35905).\nExcretion\nIn menopausal adults, 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, a constituent of black cohosh, was reported to have a half-life of approximately two hours (35905).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of black cohosh are the rhizome and root. The active constituents of black cohosh include phytosterin; organic acids including isoferulic acid (as well as its esters cimiracemate A and cimiracemate B), fukinolic acid, caffeic acid, salicylic acid, cimicifugic acid A, cimicifugic acid B, cimicifugic acid E, cimicifugic acid F, cinnamic acid ester dehydrocimicifugic A, dehydrocimicifugic acid B, dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, and ferulic acid; sugars; tannins; long-chain fatty acids; and triterpene glycosides, including acetein, cimicifugoside, and 27-deoxyactein (4618, 9432, 11912, 35786, 35787, 35792, 35793, 35798, 35803, 35808)(35817, 35820, 35821, 35835, 35851, 35891, 35905, 35910, 35953). The presence of an isoflavone, formononetin, is doubtful (1122, 4616, 9431). Earlier reports of isoflavone content may have been a result of contamination with other similar plant species (4615).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFukinolic acid is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, which is important in inflammatory responses (9432). In vitro, the black cohosh constituent cimiracemate A has been shown to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production in human blood macrophages (35901). The black cohosh constituent isoferulic acid has been shown to decrease LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma (35903).\nAntihistamine effects\nIn vivo oral administration of black cohosh extract inhibited the anti-IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction (35815). Black cohosh extract also inhibited histamine release.\nAntilipemic effects\nSome clinical evidence has evaluated the potential lipid-lowering effects of black cohosh but results are conflicting. In postmenopausal adults, taking black cohosh isopropanolic aqueous extract 40 mg daily for 3 months slightly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with baseline (13184). However, other clinical evidence suggests that black cohosh does not affect lipid levels in perimenopausal or postmenopausal adults (16850). Animal research suggests that the black cohosh constituent actein alters the expression of a gene involved with the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol by the liver, resulting in a reduction in fatty acid and cholesterol content (35891).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is some concern that black cohosh may promote the growth of certain cancers due to its potential estrogenic effects. Also, some in vitro evidence suggests that the black cohosh constituents actaealactone and cimicifugic acid G can increase the growth of human breast cancer cells (35831). However, other preliminary research on breast cancer cells suggests that black cohosh doesn't promote tumor growth (9435, 9436, 11911). In fact, some in vitro research suggests that black cohosh or its constituents can inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells or other estrogen-responsive cancer cell lines (9990, 11912, 35869, 35846, 35954, 35953). Also, evidence from in vitro research suggests that black cohosh may antagonize the proliferative effects of estradiol on a human breast cancer cell line (35794). Animal research suggests that black cohosh doesn't increase or decrease risk of breast cancer (9999). But black cohosh does seem to increase metastatic cancer in animals with existing cancer (9999). Therefore, black cohosh shouldn't be used by patients with existing breast cancer or those with a high risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nSome preliminary research suggests that a black cohosh extract can inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro (13145). Other in vitro evidence suggests that black cohosh extract can inhibit the growth of hormone responsive or hormone-unresponsive prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and activating caspases (35823). In animal models, a specific black cohosh extract called CR BNO 1055 (Klimadynon/Menofem, Bionorica AG) seems to inhibit prostate cancer tumor development and proliferation (14422).\n\nEvidence from animal research suggests that black cohosh decreases the cytotoxicity of cisplatin on breast cancer cells in an animal model (13101). However, other research shows conflicting results. Some in vitro research suggests black cohosh might increase the toxicity of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and docetaxel (Taxotere) (10000, 13101). Other in vitro research suggests that black cohosh ethanol extract and the black cohosh constituent actein can increase breast cancer growth inhibition when used in combination with doxorubicin, while actein appears to increase growth inhibition when used with 5-fluorouracil and enhances apoptosis when used with paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, or doxorubicin (35835). Laboratory studies suggest that the anticancer effects of actein result from its ability to repress cell cycle genes and activate transcription factors involved in apoptosis (35847, 35856).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that black cohosh extracts can scavenge reactive oxygen species and protect against DNA damage, which may contribute to its potential anticancer effects (35798). Constituents of black cohosh believed to have antioxidant activity include actaealactone; caffeic acid; methyl caffeate; ferulic acid; isoferulic acid; fukinolic acid; cimicifugic acids A, B, and F; and cimiracemates A and B (35798, 35831, 35849).\nAntiviral effects\nThe acetein constituent of black cohosh seems to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In vitro it seems to decrease replication of HIV in lymphocytes (13004).\nBone metabolism effects\nAn isopropanolic extract of black cohosh has been shown to diminish the urinary content of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline, specific markers for bone loss, in an ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis (35811). Also, preliminary clinical evidence suggests that black cohosh might increase osteoblast activity (10987, 14330). Taking a specific black cohosh extract (CR BNO 1055) daily for 12 weeks or taking an isopropanolic extract of black cohosh (Remifemin, Schaper & Brümmer , Ringelheim, Germany) daily for 3 months seems to increase levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), which is a marker of bone formation, after 12 weeks of treatment (14330, 35865).\nCNS effects\nPreliminary research suggests that black cohosh might act as a partial agonist at serotonin receptors including 5HT-1A, 5HT-1D, and 5HT-7 receptors (11030, 104517, 116172). This effect could play a role in reducing menopausal symptoms. Other in vitro research suggests that black cohosh extracts can function as human mu-opiate receptor agonists. The mu opiate receptor is essential for temperature and hormone homeostasis, which may explain the effects of black cohosh in alleviating menopausal symptoms (35839). Black cohosh also acts at dopaminergic D2 receptors (104517).\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) effects\nSome animal and in vitro studies have reported that black cohosh inhibits various cytochrome P450 enzymes including 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, but this seems to occur at doses 25-50 times higher than those used clinically in humans (11032, 35907, 104517). In healthy volunteers, supplementation with black cohosh for 14 days did not affect CYP2D6 (16848). Also in healthy volunteers, black cohosh taken daily for 28 days inhibited CYP2D6 by 7%, which was not clinically significant (13536, 35899). In another trial in healthy volunteers, black cohosh 80 mg daily for 14 days did not have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (14420).\nEstrogenic effects\nBlack cohosh has estrogen-like effects that are exerted by an unknown mechanism (4618, 4619, 14330). Laboratory research suggests that extracts of black cohosh do not bind to estrogen receptors, up-regulate estrogen-dependent genes, or stimulate the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors in experimental animals (4619, 7860, 9996, 10979, 11030). Clinically, black cohosh does not appear to affect endometrial tissue or hormone levels such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or prolactin (4620, 7054, 9437, 10987, 14330, 35962). But there is some evidence from animal studies that black cohosh might suppress pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) (12064).\n\nIt's thought that black cohosh might have selective estrogen receptor modulating (SERM) effects and therefore have estrogenic effects in some tissues and antiestrogenic effects in other tissues. For example, in animal models, there is preliminary evidence that black cohosh might have a modest estrogenic effect on bone and suppress LH, but it doesn't seem to stimulate an increase in uterine weight (12064). Other evidence suggests that a specific black cohosh ethanol extract (Ze 450), inhibits estradiol-induced proliferation of estrogen-receptor positive human breast cancer cells, suggesting antiestrogenic effects (35830). However, the black cohosh extract also appears to inhibit the growth of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, suggesting that its anticancer effect may involve other mechanisms besides antiestrogenic activity.\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn vitro, black cohosh extracts moderately inhibited the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate, a typical organic anion-transporting polypeptide B (OATP-B) substrate (35450). As OATP-B is involved in the intestinal absorption of various drugs, black cohosh may decrease the absorption of orally administered substrates of OATP-B.\nHematologic effects\nAnimal research suggests that dose-related increases in micronucleated red blood cells are indicative of chromosomal alterations following the administration of black cohosh extract. In addition, the animals developed a nonregenerative macrocytic anemia resembling megaloblastic anemia in humans. However, further investigation into whether human exposure to black cohosh carries similar risks shows that there is minimal chance of chromosomal damage or increased frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (111713).\nVascular effects\nAnimal research suggests that actein, a constituent of black cohosh, can induce peripheral vasodilation and subsequent hypotension in animals (35956). Other laboratory evidence suggests that the black cohosh constituents cimicifugic acid D and fukinolic acid can cause vasorelaxation of aortic strips that were precontracted with norepinephrine. This effect was attributed to the ability of these constituents to suppress norepinephrine-induced calcium influx from the extracellular space. However, the constituent cimicifugic acid C appears to induce weak vasoconstriction (35948). Limited research also suggests that black cohosh can cause vasodilatation in humans. A preliminary clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking a specific black cohosh supplement standardized to 2.5% triterpene glycosides (Clifemin, Herbarium) 160 mg daily for 28 days increases brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) when compared with placebo (101695)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnthocyanins isolated from oral black currant juice do not appear to be well-absorbed (11098), although anthocyanin rutinosides appear to be absorbed at a higher rate than anthocyanin glucosides (35982). The time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of anthocyanins after ingestion of black currant juice was 0.75-1.5 hours and it remains detectable for up to 8 hours (35982, 102701). The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve of total anthocyanins were found to be 5.3- and 6.2-fold higher, respectively, with elderberry extract when compared with black currant extract (11098).\nExcretion\nAnthocyanins isolated from black currant are minimally excreted in the urine after consumption (11098). The highest levels of anthocyanin rutinosides in the urine occur in the first 4 hours, with no or very low levels occurring after 24 hours. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) and gallic acid (GA) were primarily excreted in the first 2 hours (102701). In one study of the polyphenolic antioxidants in black currant fruit juice, urinary excretion of quercetin seemed to be a small but constant function of quercetin intake. The fraction excreted in urine was constant at 0.29% to 0.47%, and plasma quercetin levels did not change with juice intervention (35979, 35991).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of black currant are the seed oil, berry, flower, and leaf. The primary biochemical constituents of black currant include anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, phenolic acids, and polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) (35980, 35986, 93698, 105537). The four major anthocyanins identified from black currant berry include delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, delphinidine-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. Anthocyanidin content in black currant berries ranges from 80-280 mg per 100 grams of fruit. The primary flavonols identified in black currant include quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol, along with their glycosides (93698, 102701). PUFAs isolated from black currant seeds and seed oil include gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, among others such as stearidonic acid (SDA). Seeds of some black currant varieties contain nearly 23% GLA by weight, with ALA content ranging from 13% to 15% (512, 515, 4016, 17634, 93698). Black currant berries also contain around 70-280 mg vitamin C per 100 grams of fruit. Other compounds identified in black currant include tannins, stilbenoids, and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron (93698).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBlack currant's anti-inflammatory effects are believed to be conferred by gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), and stearidonic acid (SDA), all of which are precursors to essential fatty acids involved in the inflammatory response cascade (93698). Black currant seed oil has been shown to markedly alter production of prostaglandin E2, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects due to a reduction in the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, possibly through the redirection of eicosanoid metabolism (35991). GLA in black currant may be beneficial for people who are unable to metabolize cis-linolenic acid to GLA, and produce adequate prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1). People with this condition have an imbalance in the ratio of inflammatory to non-inflammatory prostaglandins. GLA is thought to improve this ratio and reduce inflammation (512, 4016).\nAnti-tumor effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) might have an antiestrogenic effect and might hasten the response to tamoxifen (Nolvadex) in women with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer (5902). GLA also seems to modulate the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (Taxol) and fulvestrant (Faslodex), enhancing malignant cell killing without adverse effects on normal cells (8133, 11791). However, other research suggests that taking GLA alone might stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells at low concentrations and inhibit growth at higher concentrations (11339).\nAntibacterial effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that black currant seed extracts have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Acidic, high-molecular-weight galactans in these extracts were found to block H. pylori surface receptors, thus inhibiting H. pylori adhesion to human gastric epithelia (35988).\nAnticoagulant effects\nGamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a constituent of black currant, may have anti-platelet effects (1979, 35995).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a puree of black currant fruit 75 grams with added sugars to provide 31 grams of available carbohydrates reduces insulin and glucose peak plasma levels and improves the glycemic profile when compared with an aqueous solution of sucrose, glucose, and fructose containing the same carbohydrate load. The anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in black currant may be responsible for these effects (105537).\nAntihypertensive effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that black currant seed oil might have antihypertensive effects, possibly due to the constituent gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) (35994). The mechanism by which GLA alters blood pressure is unknown.\nAntioxidant effects\nBlack currant has antioxidant activity (35991, 35979, 93698). Some evidence suggests that the anthocyanin glycosides from black currant are responsible for its antioxidant effects, with the delphinidin aglycon and 3-rutinosyl moiety having the greatest antioxidant activity (35979).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that the black currant extract known as Kurokarin may have antiviral effects. The extract inhibited influenza virus release from infected cells (35981), inhibited herpes simplex 1 virus attachment on the cell membrane, and inhibited varicella zoster protein synthesis (35984).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome in vitro and animal research shows that black currant has antithrombotic and vasorelaxant properties and increases peripheral blood flow (17633, 93698). Preliminary clinical research in adults with PAD shows that consuming a combination of black currant juice 250 mL and orange juice 250 mL twice daily for 28 days reduces markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, but not endothelial activation, when compared with placebo. It is unclear if this effect is due to black currant, orange juice, or the combination (17636).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using black currant to improve skin health and to slow skin aging. Research in animals and in vitro shows that black currant extract and black currant anthocyanins increase collagen and elastin in rat skin and in human fibroblast cells. Collagen and elastin maintain elasticity and flexibility in the skin and prevent the skin surface from becoming saggy and wrinkled (99739).\nImmune-enhancing effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that black currant seed oil has moderate immune-enhancing effects in older patients, possibly due to its ability to reduce prostaglandin E2 production (4016, 93698).\nLipid-lowering effects\nThere is interest in using multiple parts of black currant for hypercholesterolemia. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adult females shows that taking black currant berry extract 460 mg orally daily for 28 days does not improve serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when compared with baseline. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (109018). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adult females shows that taking black currant seed oil 3 grams orally daily for 4 weeks increases the reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 8 mg/dL more than fish oil 2.8 grams daily (17634).\nMuscle oxygenation effects\nA small study in elite rock climbers shows that taking a black currant extract 600 mg daily for 7 days improves forearm muscle oxygenation, but has no effect on forearm muscle performance, during exhaustive exercise bouts. It is suggested that the improved muscle oxygenation is due to increased blood flow caused by altered endothelial function (105539).\nNeurological effects\nMany of the constituents in black currant have been shown to have antioxidant properties, which could provide neuroprotective effects (93698).\nOphthalmic effects\nThe vasorelaxant effects of black currant anthocyanins may increase blood flow to the eye, potentially improving eye function (93698). Some clinical evidence shows that black currant anthocyanins normalize plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1), which are often abnormal in patients with glaucoma. This may improve ET-1 dependent regulation of ocular hemodynamics in glaucoma patients (93697).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking black currant anthocyanins 50 mg orally daily along with standard medications for glaucoma for 24 months improves ocular blood flow when compared with placebo (93695). Clinical research in patients with and without glaucoma shows that taking black currant anthocyanins 50 mg orally daily for 4 weeks modestly decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) when compared with placebo (93696)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of black hoof mushroom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of black hoof mushroom is the entire mushroom. Bioactive constituents of black hoof mushroom include hispidin, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, fumaric acid, and protocatechuic acid (99751). Other constituents of black hoof mushroom include, phelligridimer A, davallialactone, methyldavallialactone, hypholomine B, interfungins A, inoscavin A, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, and ellagic acid (27618); phellinone (27619); protocatechualdehyde (27618, 27622, 27626); inoscavin A (27614, 27618, 27626); phellinusfuran A and phellinusfuran B (27620); acidic heteroglycopeptide (27621); succinic acid, and fumaric acid (27622); hypholomine B and meshimakobnol (27614); retinoic acid derivative (27599); proteoglycan (27624); hispolon (27625); amino acids and sugars, such as mannose, galactose, glucose, arabinose, and xylose (27624); hispidin and its dimers, (27616, 27618, 27626, 91008), and uronic acid (27600).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animals, a proteoglycan isolated from black hoof mushroom prevents and treats collagen-induced arthritis (91011). In this model, there are decreases in anti-CII IgG and IgG2a antibodies (Abs) and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In vitro, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action have been suggested, such as an inhibited production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression by activation of reactive oxygen species-based NF kappaB and MAP kinase activation (27605), as well as activation of the PKCdelta/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (27606). In vitro, black hoof mushroom has anti-inflammatory effects in a macrophage cell line. Black hoof mushroom inhibits the production of nitric oxide, as well as levels of prostaglandin E2, IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha (111929).\nAntiallergy effects\nIn animals, black hoof mushroom extract inhibits mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis, the associated ear swelling response, and histamine release induced by IgE-dependent mouse triphasic cutaneous reaction, possibly by inhibiting cellular calcium uptake and increasing cAMP levels (91005). In vitro, black hoof mushroom inhibits vascular permeability and facilitates the production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma from anti-CD3 mouse splenocytes, (91006). Other in vitro research shows that black hoof mushroom (either grown alone or on brown rice) may increase the proportion of CD4+ T cells in mesenteric lymphocytes, thereby regulating immune responses by modulating the TH1/Th2 balance (91004).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, one of three black hoof mushroom extracts tested shows antibacterial activity against the methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (91007).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animals, although black hoof mushroom extract does not appear to affect fasting serum glucose, insulin secretion as measured using the hyperglycemic clamp, or insulin resistance as assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (27592), antidiabetic effects of black hoof mushroom constituents were shown by the inhibition of aldose reductase (27618).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro and in vivo research suggests that black hoof mushroom extracts have antifungal effects against Candida albicans. In an animal model of vulvovaginal candidiasis, the extract reduces vaginal fungal load and suppresses inflammation, as evidenced by reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The study suggests the most efficacious extract comes from the fruiting bodies of black hoof mushroom (116216).\nAntilipidemic effects\nIn animals, polysaccharides derived from black hoof mushroom have been shown to reduce serum triglyceride, blood cholesterol, and serum low-density lipoprotein, and to increase high-density lipoprotein in hyperlipemic mice (91012).\nAntineoplastic effects\nAnticancer effects of various fractions of black hoof mushroom have been shown in animal research (27633). Potential anticancer mechanisms of action include stimulation of hormonal and cell-mediated immune function, decreased inflammatory reactions, apoptosis of cancer cells, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis (27593, 27610, 27625). In vitro, black hoof mushroom was found to have synergistic apoptotic and cell cycle arrest effects with doxorubicin (27627, 27628). Animal and in vitro studies have demonstrated that black hoof mushroom and its constituents have anticancer effects, such as activation of macrophages via upregulation of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (27609, 27630, 27631, 91009), inhibition of cancer cell growth via activation of T helper cells, and other mechanisms (27615, 27627, 27628, 27629, 27630, 27631, 27632, 27634, 27635, 27636)(27637, 27638, 27639, 91009). In animal and in vitro research, black hoof mushroom inhibits metastasis at least partly via regulation of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), a protein associated with invasion and metastasis (27611, 27634) and inhibits angiogenesis through the inhibition of AKT cell signaling (27634).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, hispiridin, a constituent of black hoof mushroom, as well as its dimers, 3,14'-'ihispidinyl, hypholomine B, and 1,1-distyrylpyrylethan, have free radical-scavenging activity (27615, 27616, 91010). Also, in vitro, black hoof mushroom extract reduces radical-induced cell viability loss, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl formation (27617).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using black hoof mushroom for cardiovascular health. Clinical research in healthy smokers shows that consuming a 600 or 900 mg black hoof mushroom and danshen capsule daily for 4 weeks reduces blood pressure and arterial wall stiffness and increases activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase when compared with placebo (99751). This suggests that the combination of black hoof mushroom and danshen might improve cardiovascular risk factors in smokers but additional research is needed to confirm.\nCytochrome P450 inhibitory effects\nIn vitro, polysaccharides from black hoof mushroom grown in culture inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 (CYP1A1), CYP1A2, CYP2B1, and CYP2E1 (27612).\nGastroprotective effects\nIn ethanol-treated rats, a mycelial culture of black hoof mushroom increases the amount of protective gastric mucus, thereby helping to maintain the mucus barrier (27594). In an animal peritonitis model, black hoof mushroom prevents intraperitoneal adhesions and abscess formation in rats by modulating fibrinolytic capacity of uPA and TNF-alpha (27595, 27596, 27597).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn animal models, black hoof mushroom seems to show hepatoprotective effects against experimentally-induced liver damage(27598). In animals, black hoof mushroom prevents reactive oxygen species and calcium influx and reduces SP1 binding, leading to inhibition of TGF-beta1-induced Col 1A2 promotor activity (27599).\nImmune system effects\nIn an animal immunodeficiency model, black hoof mushroom extracts increases the immune response by increasing the production of plaque-forming cells (27601). In another animal model, black hoof mushroom increases the expression and secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma by T lymphocytes (27613) and increases the non-specific and humoral immune responses (27641). In another animal model, black hoof mushroom results in the stimulation of some types of T cells (111929). In a septic shock model, a polysaccharide from black hoof mushroom reduces levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-1beta, and enhances apoptosis of activated macrophages and lymphocytes (27602). In vitro, black hoof mushroom grown on germinated brown rice reduces IgE production by affecting the balance of Th1/Th2 resulting in a down-regulation of Th2 response in mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes (91004). Other mechanisms of action related to immune effects include the stimulation of B cell proliferation and increased cytokine and nitric oxide production from macrophages (91009). Despite these findings, it is unclear whether black hoof mushroom affects the immune system response in humans. Most research in humans suggests that taking black hoof mushroom extract does not affect natural killer cell activity, white blood cell counts, or immunoglobulin or cytokine levels (111930). However, the available studies are small and more research is needed.\nNeurologic effects\nIn vitro, hispidin, a constituent of black hoof mushroom, inhibits beta-secretase, an enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in cognitive disorders (91008).\nUlcerative colitis effects\nIn an animal model of ulcerative colitis, an acidic polysaccharide isolated from black hoof mushroom alleviates some symptoms such as weight loss and reduces colon tissue damage. These effects may be due to multiple processes including reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced oxidative stress enzymes, modulation of gut microbiota, and improved function of the gut barrier (116217)."

The twigs contain flavones, flavonols, and other flavonoid constituents (103801).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome in vitro research shows that sanggenon-type flavones extracted from black mulberry twigs have antidiabetic effects. These constituents appear to activate PPAR-gamma, a key receptor in the regulation of glucose metabolism, although the inhibition is much lower than that seen with the thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone, which has significant hypoglycemic effects through its agonistic effects on PPAR-gamma (103801). Additional in vitro research shows that black mulberry extracts inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, possibly to a greater degree than acarbose (Precose), an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of these enzymes decreases the breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates in the gastrointestinal tract (103802, 105797).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome in vitro research shows that black mulberry fruit extract powder scavenges free radicals more effectively than vitamin C. Polyphenols in black mulberry fruit are thought to be responsible for these antioxidant effects (103802).\nLaxative effects\nThe pectin in black mulberry fruit may have laxative activity (7)."

In most cases, the deceased were children who were punished by having to consume large amounts of black pepper (5619). In another case, a child with a history of pica accidentally overdosed on black pepper. In this case, the child aspirated black pepper, leading to respiratory arrest, anoxia, and death (5620).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with black pepper.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of black pepper.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of black pepper is the fruit, which contains 5% to 9% piperine. A typical North American diet provides about 360 mg of black pepper daily, which would provide about 60-110 micromole of piperine (14375). Other constituents include chavicine, piperamine, piperidine, and other piperamides (29305, 89893). Black pepper oil is distilled from black pepper (11).\nAntibacterial effects\nBlack pepper is said to have antimicrobial effects (18). In laboratory research, black pepper extract and volatile oils had antibacterial effects against various bacteria (2130, 33826). Piperine might play a role in the antibacterial effects of black pepper, possibly by acting as an efflux pump inhibitor (29173). However, black pepper extract does not appear to have antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori isolates (36131).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn laboratory research, black pepper extracts inhibit enzymatic or non-enzymatic diabetic complications, such as protein glycation (30646, 46887, 46888). Piperine, a constituent of black pepper, has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels in animal diabetic models (29225).\nAntifungal effects\nBlack pepper is said to have antimicrobial effects (18). Laboratory research suggests that black pepper essential oil and constituents have antifungal effects (29270, 46242). Black pepper essential oil might also protect against the production of aflatoxin, a toxin created by certain fungi, and inhibit aflatoxin toxicity (39902, 43630). It is possible that the constituent piperine inhibits aflatoxin B1-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting some cytochrome P450 metabolic effects (29332, 29333).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome of the pharmacological or clinical effects of black pepper may be due to antioxidant effects of black pepper constituents. Antioxidant effects of black pepper, as well as its essential oils and oleoresins, have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal models. It is likely that various constituents play a role (29180, 29303, 29306, 29335, 29336, 31454).\nAntiparasitic effects\nBlack pepper is thought to have antiparasitic effects. In laboratory research, essential oil of black pepper had antiparasitic effects against red mite (39811) but did not reduce the viability of Toxoplasma gondii in experimentally infected pork (29205). The constituent piperine might play a role in these possible effects (29201, 29202, 29203, 29204).\nCancer effects\nSome evidence suggests that black pepper might protect against colon cancer and other tumors (3761, 29276). Piperine has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in laboratory research (29319, 29320, 29321). Potential mechanisms of action include altered activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes and other detoxification enzymes, as well as reduced oxidative effects (29310, 29311, 29312, 29325).\n\nHowever, other evidence suggests black pepper might cause liver tumors (3759). Black pepper contains at least four constituents that have shown carcinogenic or mutagenic effects in laboratory research (29167, 29235, 29259).\nCognitive effects\nBlack pepper is sometimes used to increase mental energy and improve cognitive effects. In animal research some evidence suggests that the constituent piperine improves learning and memory. However, in clinical research, a single dose of black pepper did not improve mental energy or mental fatigue (91731).\nDermatological effects\nBlack pepper is commonly taken for vitiligo, a skin condition resulting in discoloration. In laboratory research, both black pepper extract and piperine have been shown to stimulate the proliferation of melanocytes, which induces pigmentation (29295, 29345, 29346). There is also interest in the effects of black pepper oil when applied to the skin. In vitro research suggests that black pepper essential oil inhibits growth of skin cancer cells and also promotes tissue remodeling and wound healing (103817).\n\nThere is also interest in using black pepper oil to improve vein accessibility while obtaining intravenous access due to its anecdotal warming and stimulating properties. In a small clinical study, applying 20% black pepper essential oil mixed with aloe vera gel topically to the vein improves both vein visibility and palpability, resulting in more accurate intravenous catheter placement when compared with standard procedures (103818).\nDiuretic effects\nBlack pepper is said to have diuretic properties (11).\nDrug absorption effects\nPiperine, a constituent of black pepper, seems to increase oral absorption of drugs and other substances by forming a complex with them (3757).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBlack pepper is said to have anti-flatulent effects (11). It is also thought to stimulate thermal receptors, induce sweating, and stimulate taste buds, causing an increase in gastric secretions (18). Piperine might be responsible for the increased gastric acid secretion seen in animal research, possibly by stimulating histamine or vanilloid receptors (29158, 29358, 39864). In human research, black pepper 1.5 grams reduces gastrointestinal transit time (29210). This may be due to the inhibition of intestinal contractions by the constituent piperine (29350, 29351, 29352, 29353).\nHepatic effects\nBlack pepper is thought to influence liver and metabolic function (11). Some evidence suggests that black pepper might induce hepatic enzymes (3760) and cause liver toxicity (29227) and tumors (3759). However, other research suggests that the black pepper constituent piperine might have hepatoprotective effects (29197, 29198). In human research, black pepper improves liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), lipid biomarkers (e.g., low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides), and fasting blood glucose in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (116202).\nInsecticidal effects\nBlack pepper is said to have insecticidal effects (18). In laboratory research, black pepper essential oil has been shown to be effective against pulse beetles, cockroaches, weevils, and various types of mosquitos (29374, 29375, 36189, 47786, 47787, 80173). This activity may be attributed to pipercide, piperine, pipnoohine, pipyahyine, and others (29196, 29373, 29376).\nWeight loss effects\nBlack pepper is said to influence metabolic function (11). It might also have lipolytic activity related to the outer layer of the fruit (11). In clinical research, taking a specific product (Medestea Biotech S.p.a.) containing capsicum oleoresin, decaffeinated green tea extract, black pepper extract, garlic extract, Fucus vesiculosus extract, mint essential oil, and L-carnitine modestly improves satiety, but not energy expenditure (90629). Also, adding black pepper to a meal had no effect on diet-induced thermogenesis, energy intake following the meal, or appetite (93948)."

Black psyllium has been used with apparent safety in doses of 15-30 grams daily for up to 6 months (19156, 10091, 93215, 102826). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires over-the-counter medicines that contain dry or incompletely hydrated psyllium to carry a warning that they should be taken with at a least a full glass of liquid to reduce the risk of choking. This labeling also applies to foods containing psyllium that are marketed with a claim of reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (93217, 93218).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when black psyllium is used orally without adequate fluid intake due to the risk for choking and gastrointestinal obstruction (2, 18, 93218). ...when granular dosage forms containing black psyllium are used as over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed a qualified health claim stating that psyllium husk may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence supporting this claim (102827).\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral black psyllium for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black psyllium for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral black psyllium is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 11 randomized clinical trials in normotensive or hypertensive adults shows that using psyllium 3.7-15 grams daily for 1-6 months reduces systolic blood pressure by an average of 2 mmHg when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that psyllium is more effective at reducing systolic blood pressure when taken for at least 8 weeks and in those with higher baseline blood pressure. Taking psyllium did not appear to affect diastolic blood pressure; however, some analyses suggest that taking psyllium may reduce diastolic blood pressure in certain subgroups, such as those with higher baseline blood pressure (102826). It is not clear if any reduction in blood pressure achieved with psyllium would be considered clinically significant. Additionally, it is not clear whether these studies used black psyllium or blond psyllium supplements.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral black psyllium is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight adults newly diagnosed with NAFLD shows that taking black psyllium 10 grams orally daily, in divided doses before lunch and dinner for 12 weeks, decreases body weight by about 2 kg and body mass index (BMI) by about 0.7 kg/m2 when compared with baseline. However, the changes in weight and BMI from baseline were similar to those in a control group receiving only standard care. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (93215).\nless\nObesity.

However, the validity of this study is limited by several sources of heterogeneity (102825). Additionally, it is not clear whether these studies used black psyllium or blond psyllium supplements.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate black psyllium for these uses.",

Taking black psyllium did not reduce postprandial serum insulin levels; however, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (12, 10091).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBlack psyllium swells in water, forming a gelatinous mass which keeps the feces soft and increases bulk, promoting peristalsis and producing a laxative effect (8, 11, 93214). In people with diarrhea, black psyllium absorbs water, regulates peristalsis, and prolongs gastrointestinal transit (18, 93214)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of black rice is the grain. Black rice contains antioxidant constituents that include phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, tocopherols, tocotrienols, gamma-oryzanol, carotenoids, and phytic acid (92536, 108666, 108665). The major anthocyanins of black rice are cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside (92522, 92528). Black rice also contains thiamine, lactoflavin, vitamin A, zinc, manganese, copper, calcium, and iron (92537). Black rice comes in a variety of forms, including black rice, germinated waxy black rice, black rice pigment fraction, black rice with a giant embryo, and an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice. Each form has a unique constituent concentration and activity profile (92522, 92523, 92528, 92532, 92534, 92533, 92556). Black rice pigment fraction is comprised of the aleurone layer of the rice and is high in anthocyanins (92528).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research in coronary heart disease patients suggests that black rice pigment fraction (BRF) can reduce levels of the inflammatory biomarkers sVCAM-1, CD40L, and C-reactive protein (92518). Black rice, its constituent cyanidin-3-glucoside, and its metabolites, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid, suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta. In vitro and in animal studies, black rice reduced the levels of nitric oxide and prostaglandin and the expression of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (92548).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn obese mice, germinated waxy black rice and a specific black rice with a giant embryo reduced body fat through increased lipolysis and prevented weight gain from a high-fat diet (92533, 92534). Extracts of black rice and the constituents cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside have also prevented increases in weight gain and fat mass in obese mice fed a high-fat diet (92549, 92552, 108664).\nAnti-osteoporosis effects\nIn ovariectomized rats, extracts of black rice prevented reductions in bone density and strength by inducing osteoblast differentiation (92549).\nAntiaging effects\nIn mice with D-galactose-induced senescence, black rice anthocyanins improved the effects of aging on daily behavior, spleen and thymus volume, and superoxide dismutase and MAO-B levels (92530).\nAntiallergy effects\nIn rats, an extract of black rice inhibited anaphylaxis through the inhibition of histamine release from mast cells (92539). In vitro, an extract of black rice bran suppressed histamine and beta-hexosaminidase and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine release (92538).\nAntiasthma effects\nIn a murine asthma model, an extract of black rice suppressed airway inflammatory markers, airway hyper-responsiveness, airway remodeling, and eosinophilia, and reduced levels of IgE and nitric oxide (92540, 92541, 92542).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and in vivo, an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice demonstrated anticancer effects against human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis (92531, 92546). Black rice anthocyanins also appear to prevent cancer metastasis through transcriptional regulation and inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in human cancer cells (92543, 92544, 92545, 92547).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn rats, an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice prevented fructose-induced insulin resistance and improved glucose intolerance after the development of insulin resistance (92532). In obese mice, a diet of a specific form of black rice which contains a giant embryo lowered serum glucose and insulin levels (92533).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that supplementation with black rice pigment fraction (BRF) may not affect lipid levels in humans (92518) or may only affect triglyceride levels (108667).\n\nIn animal research, black rice, germinated waxy black rice, black rice with a giant embryo, and an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice have decreased total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (92522, 92523, 92532, 92534, 92533, 92556, 108664). However, not all animal research consistently shows improvement of LDL and HDL cholesterol levels (108663).\n\nIn rats fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet, an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice decreased hepatic lipogenesis by regulation of malic enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (92553). In rabbits, cyanidin-3-glucoside in ground black rice also decreased LDL oxidation (92554). In vitro, two constituents of a black rice extract, cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside, inhibited the absorption of cholesterol by colon adenocarcinoma cells (92524). Another in vitro study suggested that an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice may reduce LDL levels by enhancing LDL clearance (92529).\nAntioxidant effects\nClinical research in healthy patients and patients with coronary heart disease shows that consuming black rice, black rice pigment fraction (BRF), and anthocyanin-rich extracts of black rice 10-100 grams for up to 6 months improves plasma antioxidant capacity and increases plasma levels of total phenols and flavonoids when compared with control (92518, 108666) This activity also occurred in animal research (92518, 92519, 92520, 92521, 92525, 92532). In animal and in vitro studies, black rice and BRF decreased oxidative stress through antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities (92527, 92528, 92529, 92550, 92551).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn humans, black rice pigment fraction (BRF) improved total antioxidant capacity and reduced levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with coronary heart disease (92518). In rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet, black rice and BRF decreased the size of atherosclerotic plaques by lowering oxidative stress and improving antioxidant status (92519, 92520). In atherogenic mice, BRF decreased the size of coronary plaques by lowering oxidative stress and reducing levels of CD4+ T-cells, nitric oxidase synthase, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. (92521). An anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice also improved platelet hyperactivity in rats with hyperlipidemia fed a high fat diet (92552).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced gastric ulcers shows that pretreatment with a single, 200-800 mg/kg dose of black rice bran extract orally reduces gastric ulcer severity when compared with control. Although some researchers have suggested that black rice may increase gastric mucus production or reduce gastric acidity, this research did not identify an effect on these parameters (108665).\nHepatic effects\nIn rats, an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice reduced alcohol-induced liver damage by decreasing activation of liver enzymes, reducing levels of hepatic malondialdehyde, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, and increasing levels of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione S-transferase (92525). In mice, cyanidin-3-glucoside from black rice prevented hepatotoxicity and the progression of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis by regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress (92555). In a murine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model, black rice extract improved hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid oxidation (92556).\nOcular effects\nIn rats, an anthocyanin-rich extract of black rice improved light-induced retinal damage by reducing photoreceptor apoptosis (92526)."

Gastrointestinal adverse effects to a specific black seed oil formulation containing 5% thymoquinone (BlaQmax) have included mild cases of bloating, burping and mild diarrhea (110264).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, relatively severe menstrual bleeding has occurred in one clinical trial (104661).\nless\nHepatic\nWhile intake of black seed has been associated with hepatotoxicity in some animal research, other animal research has not confirmed this finding (245, 95982). One case report describes hepatotoxicity, kidney injury, and rhabdomyolysis occurring in an otherwise healthy 26-year-old male after taking black seed oil 1000 mg twice daily for 1 month. The patient was hospitalized for critical care management, including hemodialysis. After 52 days in the hospital, the patient had recovered and was discharged (114812).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, black seed has been reported to cause bullous drug eruption and maculopapular eruption (94480, 100324). Topically, black seed and its oil can cause allergic contact dermatitis (6, 36053, 36296, 36297, 100324, 110266). One case of bullous drug eruption with skin detachment has been reported for a 54-year-old woman who used black seed oil orally. The eruptions resolved following treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05%. Although this patient showed a positive skin prick test for undiluted black seed oil, the tests were negative when the oil was diluted to 10% and 1% (94480). A 28-year-old woman developed a rash following topical use of black seed oil. She was diagnosed with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), including enlarged lymph nodes, and required systemic corticosteroid treatment. This diagnosis was confirmed six months later following confirmation with a patch test (110277). In another case report, a 58-year-old woman developed eczematous lesions on the lower and upper eyelids after topical application of an oil containing black seed. This reaction was followed by the development of a diffuse maculopapular eruption after taking two oral capsules containing black seed oil. It is theorized that the topical application of black seed oil led to systemic sensitization prior to the use of oral black seed in this patient (100324).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, black seed might cause renal dysfunction. A case of acute renal failure thought to be related to use of black seed tablets 2-2.5 grams daily has been reported for a 62 year-old patient with diabetes (94477). Additionally, a case of acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatotoxicity has been reported in an otherwise healthy 26-year-old male after taking black seed oil 1000 mg twice daily for 1 month. The patient was hospitalized for critical care management, including hemodialysis. . After 52 days in the hospital, the patient had recovered and was discharged (114812).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAcne. Topical black seed extract hydrogel seems to improve acne.\nIn patients with mild to moderate acne, clinical research shows that topical application with a hydrogel containing black seed extract 0.1% twice daily for 60 days reduces the number of comedones, papules, and pupules by a large amount when compared with placebo. The overall improvement, as rated by a physician, was 78% for the black seed extract hydrogel, compared with 3% for the placebo gel (101551).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral black seed oil seems to reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis over 4-8 weeks. It is unclear if black seed is beneficial long-term.\nClinical research shows that taking capsules containing black seed oil 0.5 mL daily for 1 month can reduce symptoms such as itching, nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose when compared with placebo in adults with allergic rhinitis (95989). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing black seed oil 500 mg (Immerfit, Phyt-Immun) for a total dose of 40-80 mg/kg orally daily for 4-8 weeks improves patient-scored symptoms of allergic rhinitis in 81% of patients, compared to 45% of patients taking placebo (36071). More research is needed to determine if black seed is beneficial long-term and how it compares to conventional allergy medications.\nless\nAsthma. Oral black seed seems to be beneficial for symptoms like wheezing and coughing and might improve lung function measures in patients with poor pulmonary function.\nSome clinical research shows that taking black seed extract for 3 months can improve symptoms such as wheezing and coughing when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe asthma who already take conventional asthma medication (36175). Other research shows that taking black seed oil (Cuminmar, Marnys) 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks can improve self-reported asthma control and daily functioning when compared with placebo in adults with inadequately controlled asthma despite using maintenance inhalers (95987).\n\nThe effects of black seed on pulmonary function are conflicting. Some research shows that taking black seed can improve lung function measures such as forced expiratory flow (36175, 36280, 94490, 101556), while other research shows no significant benefit (95987, 101556). Doses used in studies showing benefit include ground black seed 2 grams daily for 12 weeks, black seed extract 15 mL/kg daily for 3 months, or a single dose of 50-100 mg/kg (36175, 36280, 94490). Differing findings may relate to pulmonary function at baseline. Taking black seed extract or black seed oil seems to improve pulmonary function in patients with abnormally low pulmonary function at baseline, but not those with predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 80% (36175, 95987). Also, single doses of black seed extract do not appear to improve pulmonary function as effectively as bronchodilators such as theophylline or salbutamol (36280).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral black seed seems to improve lung function measures in patients with COPD using inhaled corticosteroids.\nIn middle-aged adults undergoing routine treatment with inhaled corticosteroids for COPD, clinical research shows that taking black seed oil (Amazing Herbs) 1 gram twice daily for 3 months improves pulmonary function tests by a small to moderate amount when compared with placebo (104663).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral black seed powder in doses of at least 2 grams daily or black seed oil 1 gram daily seem to improve glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies shows that black seed reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.4%. However, analysis of 7 clinical studies suggests that black seed does not reduce fasting blood glucose (111503). One clinical study shows that taking black seed powder 1 gram twice daily for 3-12 months improves HbA1c and decreases fasting blood glucose by 17% to 26% when compared to baseline in patients with diabetes who are already using antidiabetes medications (94479, 94485). These improvements were significant when compared with placebo at 3 months and 9 months, but not at 12 months (94485). Clinical research also shows that taking black seed powder 1 gram twice daily also improves levels of total cholesterol by 10% to 12% when compared with placebo in patients with diabetes (94478); a lower dose of 1 gram daily does not seem to be beneficial (94479).\n\nThe effect of black seed oil has also been investigated. Clinical research shows that taking black seed oil 450 mg three times daily for 12 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose by around 14 mg/dL and HbA1c by 0.3% in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes when compared with baseline. However, these improvements were inferior to those reported in patients taking metformin 2000 mg daily (102062). Other clinical research shows that taking black seed oil 1 gram daily for 8 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose by 23.0 mg/dL and HbA1c by 0.69% from baseline. These changes, as well as reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significant when compared with placebo (110269). Other clinical research also shows that taking black seed oil 1 gram daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with placebo. However, baseline levels for each of these parameters were higher in the treatment group when compared with the placebo group, raising concerns about the validity of these findings (101552).\n\nThe black seed constituent thymoquinone has also been investigated in clinical research. Clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking thymoquinone 50 mg or 100 mg daily in addition to metformin 1 gram daily for 90 days increases the number of patients with HbA1c levels of less than 7.0% when compared with metformin alone. However, it is unclear if fasting blood glucose levels are further reduced (110270).\n\nBlack seed has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized clinical study in treatment-naïve adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of black seed 250 mg, cassia cinnamon, and ficin (NW Low-Glu) 4-5 times daily for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c by 0.6-0.8% and 2-hour postprandial glucose by 25-35 mg/dL when compared to baseline and is similarly effective to metformin. However, there were no notable improvements in fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, or beta cell function (111710). It is unclear if these effects are due to black seed, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral black seed 2 grams daily seems to improve H. pylori eradication when used in combination with standard therapies.\nClinical research shows that in patients receiving quadruple therapy with metronidazole, amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and omeprazole, the eradication of H. pylori occurred in 88% of patients receiving quadruple therapy plus black seed powder 1 gram twice daily for 8 weeks, compared with 55% of patients taking quadruple therapy alone. Quality of life was also improved (101555). Clinical research also shows that taking black seed powder (BioExtract Ltd) 2 grams daily along with omeprazole 40 mg daily for 4 weeks produces H. pylori eradication in 67% of patients, compared to 83% of patients taking standard triple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole taken for 1 week. However, this study also found that taking black seed powder 1 gram or 3 grams daily along with omeprazole was less effective than standard triple therapy (95980). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral black seed seems to modestly improve serum lipids in patients with or without hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 24 moderate-quality, clinical studies in healthy adults and patients with various cardiometabolic conditions shows that taking black seed modestly reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases HDL cholesterol when compared with placebo or control (114813). Interpretation of findings is limited by significant heterogeneity in results which may be due to the inclusion of different patient populations, doses or types of black seed preparations, and treatment durations. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes with or without hyperlipidemia shows that taking black seed reduces total cholesterol by 17 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 12 mg/dL, but does not improve high-density (HDL) lipoprotein cholesterol, when compared with a control (111503). Additionally, some preliminary clinical research shows that taking whole crushed black seed 1 gram twice daily or black seed powder 1 gram daily for 4-8 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 5% to 16%, LDL cholesterol by 8% to 27%, and triglycerides by 17% to 22% when compared to baseline in these patients; these improvements are significantly greater than changes in the placebo group (18221, 94484).\n\nThe effect of black seed when used in combination with statins shows conflicting results. One clinical study shows that taking black seed powder 1 gram twice daily for 6 weeks does not decrease cholesterol levels when compared with statins alone in normocholesterolemic, borderline hypercholesterolemic, or hypercholesterolemic patients (36244). Other clinical research in adults with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking whole crushed black seed 500 mg, garlic oil 250 mg, and simvastatin 10 mg daily for 8 weeks produces a larger increase in HDL cholesterol and a greater reduction in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with simvastatin 10 mg daily alone (95985). Reasons for these conflicting results may relate to the black seed dose or formulation and the cholesterol levels of the included patients at baseline.\n\nTaking whole crushed black seed 1 gram twice daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with aerobic training does not appear to improve LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with aerobic training alone in females with hypercholesterolemia; however, it appears to modestly increase HDL cholesterol levels (95983).\nless\nHypertension. Oral black seed powder and black seed oil seem to reduce blood pressure by a small amount. However, if it is unclear if taking black seed is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nMeta-analyses of results from 33 small clinical studies in patients with or without hypertension show that taking black seed powder 0.5-3 grams daily or black seed oil 0.1-4.2 grams daily for 4-16 weeks reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 2-3 mmHg when compared with placebo (16437, 94489, 112242). Subgroup analysis suggests that black seed supplementation is most beneficial for durations of 8 weeks or less and in patients over 50 years old with a BMI of 25-30 kg/m2 (112242). Another study in the analysis that included patients with or without hypertension found that taking black seed oil 2.5 mL twice daily after meals for 8 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 11 mmHg and 10 mmHg, respectively, when compared to baseline (96929).\nless\nMastalgia. Topical black seed oil seems to reduce breast pain.\nClinical research shows that applying 2 grams of gel containing 30% black seed oil at the site of pain twice daily for two menstrual cycles reduces breast pain by about 82% when compared to baseline. This improvement is similar to diclofenac gel and significantly greater than placebo gel, which reduces pain by only 18% (94483).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral black seed oil reduces cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin treatment.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 2-16 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia shows that taking black seed oil 80 mg/kg in three divided doses daily for one week, starting with each doxorubicin infusion therapy, is protective against some, but not most, measures of cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin. However, it is unclear if any of these changes are associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcome (101554).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral or topical black seed oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms of atopic dermatitis.\nOne small study reports that using 15% black seed oil ointment topically for 4 weeks does not improve disease severity, pruritus, or hydration in patients with atopic dermatitis (36316). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing black seed oil 500 mg (Immerfit, Phyt-Immun) for a total dose of 40-80 mg/kg daily for 4-8 weeks improves subjective patient-scored symptoms of atopic dermatitis in 50% of patients when compared to baseline (36071).\nless\nAutoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.\nClinical research in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis shows that taking black seed powder 2 grams daily for 8 weeks increases thyroid stimulating hormone levels by 36% and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody levels by 50% when compared to baseline; these improvements are significant when compared with placebo. However, black seed powder does not improve thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels when compared with placebo (94481).\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with coronary artery disease.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking black seed oil 2 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9.52 mm Hg and 8.26 mm Hg, respectively, when compared with placebo. Fasting blood glucose, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences were also modestly reduced. There was no effect on other glycemic indices. There was also no effect on blood lipids; however, most patients were taking statins (110276).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced phlebitis. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for reducing the severity of phlebitis in patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy.\nPreliminary clinical research in cancer patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy shows that applying 5 drops of black seed oil around the peripheral vein catheter twice daily for 3 days decreases phlebitis severity and reduces the relative risk of phlebitis at 72 hours by 35% when compared with no treatment. These results suggest that for every 3 patients treated with black seed oil for 3 days, one additional case of phlebitis will be prevented (102060).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral black seed oil is beneficial for patients with CKD.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD shows that taking black seed oil (Kalonji oil, Mohammedia products) 2.5 mL once daily for 12 weeks as add-on therapy with alpha-keto analogues of essential amino acids improves measures of kidney function by a small amount when compared with taking the alpha-keto analogues alone (101550).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral black seed might improve some measures of memory or cognitive function.\nClinical research in a small group of adolescent males shows that taking crushed black seed 500 mg daily for 4 weeks improves some measures of short-term or long-term recall when compared with placebo (96915). Other clinical research in a small group of middle-aged men shows that taking black seed 500 mg twice daily for 9 weeks improves some measures of memory, attention, and cognitive function when compared with placebo (96928). The improvements in both studies appear to be modest, so the clinical significance is unclear.\nless\nConstipation. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nContraception. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for contraception, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this purpose.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with COVID-19.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild COVID-19 shows that taking black seed oil (Marnys Cuminmar) 500 mg twice daily for 10 days results in recovery by day 14, defined as freedom of symptoms lasting three days, in 62% of patients, compared with 36% of those patients not given black seed oil. Also, the duration to recovery was reduced by 1.6 days (110267). Preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking black seed (Baraka, Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Cairo, Egypt) 900 mg twice daily for 14 days modestly reduces the severity of some symptoms, including cough, diarrhea, fatigue, and pharyngitis, as well as the percentage of patients with viral positivity at day 7, when compared with standard care alone. Similar findings occurred when black seed was taken with vitamin D3 (Davalindi, Medical Union Pharma, Cairo, Egypt) 2,000 IU daily (110265). These studies are limited by a lack of placebo and blinding. A meta-analysis of 3 studies in patients with COVID-19 shows that taking black seed 40-80 mg/kg for 13-14 days or 500 mg twice daily for 7 days reduces the odds of mortality by 78% relative to patients with COVID-19 who did not use black seed (112243).\n\nIn contrast to these findings, clinical research in patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 does not show that taking black seed for 10 days has beneficial effects on symptoms or inflammatory markers when compared with charcoal as control. The black seed form in this study varied between whole seeds and powder, as well as the number (two to nine) of capsules taken in divided doses daily (110271).\n\nBlack seed oil has also been investigated in combination with other compounds. Preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 given standard care shows that taking black seed powder 80 mg/kg daily in combination with raw honey 1 gram/kg daily for 13 days reduces the time to alleviate symptoms by approximately 50%, and the time to clear virus by about 35%, when compared with placebo capsules and no honey. In patients with moderate symptoms, 63.6% had resumed normal activity within 6 days when compared with 10.9% of those taking placebo. In patients with severe symptoms, 50% were discharged from hospital by day 6 compared with 2.8% of those taking placebo, and the mortality rate was reduced by approximately 79% (110261). It is not clear if any beneficial effects are due to black seed, honey, or the combination.\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if topical black seed oil reduces menstrual pain.\nClinical research shows that topical application of black seed oil (Barij Essence Company) 1-2 drops to the fontanel lobe of the head each night for up to 8 days, starting three days before menstruation, for three menstrual cycles modestly reduces menstrual pain when compared with olive oil (104662). It is unclear if any benefits are clinically significant.\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral black seed oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a 1:1:1 mixture of a black seed oil, honey, and water orally for 2 months improves overall symptoms of dyspepsia by approximately 43%, compared to only 10% in the placebo group (94487).\nless\nEpilepsy. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with epilepsy.\nSome preliminary clinical research in children aged 13 months to 13 years with epilepsy shows that taking black seed extract 40 mg/kg every 8 hours for 4 weeks reduces the frequency of seizures in 65% of, compared to only 20% of patients taking placebo (36180). Other preliminary clinical research in children 2-16 years of age with epilepsy shows that taking black seed oil 40-80 mg/kg daily does not reduce seizure frequency or severity when compared with placebo (94491). It is possible that there is a constituent found in the extract, and absent in the oil, that is responsible for any anti-seizure effects of black seed.\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if topical black seed is beneficial for patients with gingivitis.\nIn patients with moderate to severe gingivitis, preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of black seed extract for three days reduces gingival swelling and redness by a moderate amount, and plaque by a small amount, when compared to baseline. However, it is less effective than scaling and root planing (104664).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for hemorrhoids, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with hepatitis C.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking black seed oil (Baraka, Pharco Pharmaceuticals) 450 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces hepatitis C viral load in 67% of patients, improves lower limb edema, and modestly increases total protein and albumin levels when compared to baseline; however, no improvement is seen in Child-Pugh score or other measures of liver function, including bilirubin, liver enzymes, or INR (95986). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral black seed oil is beneficial for patients with prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in obese patients with prediabetes shows that taking black seed oil (Baraka450; Pharco Pharmaceutical Company) 450 mg twice daily for 6 months improves most anthropometric, lipid, and glycemic parameters when compared with baseline. Also, most improvements are similar to changes following the use of metformin 500 mg twice daily or following a controlled diet and exercise regimen (110275).\nless\nInfluenza. Although there is interest in using oral black seed for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral black seed oil is beneficial for patients with insomnia.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with self-reported sleep problems shows that taking a specific black seed oil extract product containing 5% thymoquinone (BlaQmax, Akay Natural Ingredients) 200 mg daily before bedtime for 90 days increases sleep quality, latency, duration, and efficiency and reduces sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction when compared with placebo. Black seed oil also improves biomarkers of sleep as shown by increased salivary melatonin and decreased orexin A (112244).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if topical black seed oil is beneficial for patients with oral lichen planus.\nClinical research in patients with oral lichen planus shows that topical application with cream containing black seed oil (Greenish Baraka black seed oil, Greenish India Pvt. Ltd., Chennai) 75% twice daily after meals for 45 days is as effective as gel containing clobetasol propionate 0.05% for reducing lesion size and burning severity (110263). Similarly, a very small, open-label, non-randomized intervention in patients with oral lichen planus shows that topical application of a mucoadhesive patch containing black seed extract 10% three times daily for 4 weeks is as effective as a triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% patch for reducing pain and burning intensity and lesion severity (114815). Both studies are limited by the lack of inclusion of a placebo-controlled group.\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral black seed oil is beneficial for male infertility.\nClinical research shows that taking black seed oil 2.5 mL twice daily for 2 months improves sperm count by 40%, sperm morphology by 32%, and sperm motility by 13% when compared with placebo in infertile males (94486).\nless\nMeniere disease. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with Meniere disease.\nA very small clinical study in adults with Meniere disease shows that taking black seed oil 1 gram daily for 3 months does not improve hearing threshold, tinnitus severity, or vertigo when compared with placebo (112245).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral black seed has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is unclear if topical black seed oil is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal females shows that taking a combination of black seed and vitex agnus-castus daily for 8 weeks, in combination with citalopram 20 mg, improves vasomotor, psychosocial, and physical symptoms of menopause when compared with placebo and citalopram (100325). It is not clear if these effects are due to black seed, vitex agnus-castus, or the combination. Clinical research in postmenopausal females shows that topical application with 2-3 drops of black seed oil (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company, Kashan, Iran) on the lower abdomen twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve sexual function or quality of life related to menopause when compared with placebo (110262).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with metabolic syndrome.\nClinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome after menopause shows that taking black seed extract 500 mg daily for 8 weeks improves levels of fasting blood sugar by 23%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 12%, and triglycerides by 8% over baseline. These changes were significant when compared with placebo. However, taking black seed extract did not improve anthropometric measures when compared with placebo (101549). In addition, preliminary clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific black seed oil product (Mohammedia Products, Hyderabad) 2.5 mL twice daily for 6 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 59%, LDL cholesterol by 50%, and fasting blood glucose by 58% over placebo (36262). The effects of this black seed oil product on other important parameters of metabolic syndrome, such as weight and blood pressure, were not reported in this study. In contrast, other clinical research shows that taking bread providing black seed powder 3 grams daily for 2 months does not have a significant effect on lipid profiles in patients with metabolic syndrome. Weight and waist circumference were not reported (104667).\nless\nMethotrexate toxicity. It is unclear if oral black seed oil is beneficial for reducing toxicity associated with methotrexate treatment.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking black seed oil (Baraka, Pharco Pharmaceuticals) 80 mg/kg orally in three divided doses daily for 1 week after each methotrexate dose prevents elevations in bilirubin and liver function enzymes when compared with placebo in children aged 4-13 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (95984).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Research suggests that oral black seed or black seed oil modestly improves some metabolic and liver health parameters in patients with NAFLD. However, some studies are small, and research related to measures of steatosis, including liver biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is needed.\nClinical research in adults with NAFLD shows that taking black seed oil 2.5 mL twice daily for 3 months, or 1000 mg (Barij Essence Co., Iran) daily for 8 weeks, modestly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and reduces levels of liver function enzymes, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with placebo (100322, 110282). These studies also show that taking black seed oil also modestly improves levels of fasting blood glucose (110282) and steatosis grade as measured by ultrasound (100322). In one study, both black seed oil capsule and placebo capsule also contained honey and water (100322). However, taking black seed oil does not seem to improve insulin levels (110282). The effect of black seed oil on blood pressure has also been investigated. Clinical research shows that taking black seed oil (Barij Black Seed Oil, Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company, Kashan, Iran) 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (110274, 110282).\n\nBlack seed has also been investigated in small clinical trials in adults with NAFLD. One trial shows that taking black seed 2 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces glucose and insulin levels, improves measures of insulin sensitivity and resistance, and reduces hepatic steatosis percentage when compared with placebo. However, there was no improvement in fibrosis scores, steatosis grades, and levels of lipids and liver function enzymes (102061). Another trial shows that using the same dose of black seed powder results in large reductions in body weight and body mass index (BMI), as well as liver enzymes, when compared with placebo. Also, 57.1% of patients taking black seed had normal fatty liver grading on abdominal ultrasound, compared with 6% of those taking placebo (110268). The reasons for these disparate results are unclear. However, it is possible the studies were underpowered to detect differences in secondary outcomes. More research is needed using gold standard measures of steatosis, including liver biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for increasing weight loss.\nMeta-analyses of preliminary clinical research show that taking black seed oil 3-5 grams daily, black seed powder 0.1-3 grams daily, or black seed extract 100-200 mg daily for up to 13 weeks reduces body weight by about 2-4 kg and body mass index (BMI) by 0.85-1.2 kg/m2 when compared with placebo. It is unclear if these reductions are clinically significant. In addition, most studies in these meta-analyses do not involve patients with a BMI over 25 kg/m2 (96926, 98815, 111503). Although some individual research shows that taking black seed powder 2 grams or black seed oil 3 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce BMI in overweight females who are also exercising or following a low-calorie diet (95983, 96927), most individual studies show that black seed or black seed oil reduces body weight and waist circumference (95730, 96927, 104661, 110269). One study shows that black seed has a moderate effect on weight loss, BMI, and waist circumference, and a small effect on total and visceral fat mass (104661). These studies have used black seed powder 1.5 grams twice daily for 3 months or black seed oil 2 or 3 grams daily for 8 weeks (95730, 96927, 104661). Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to concomitant use with dieting or exercise.\n\nIt is unclear if taking black seed oil improves the lipid profile of individuals with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2. One small clinical study shows that taking black seed oil 2 grams daily for 8 weeks has a small to moderate effect on levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (104666). However, another study shows that although taking black seed oil 3 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces triglyceride levels more than placebo, there is no effect on HDL or LDL cholesterol levels (96927).\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking black seed powder 500 mg by mouth three times daily for 12 days decreases symptoms of opioid withdrawal by 70% to 77% when compared to baseline (36239). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral submucous fibrosis shows that taking black seed 1000 mg 3 times daily for 3 months increases mouth opening by 14%, cheek flexibility by 44%, tongue protrusion by 9%, and reduces burning sensations by 79% when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a combination product containing turmeric and black pepper (114880). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical black seed oil is beneficial for knee osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying black seed oil 1 mL to the knee by massaging into the skin for 5 minutes three times daily for 3 weeks reduces pain when compared to baseline and produces a larger reduction in pain than acetaminophen 325 mg three times daily for 3 weeks (95981). Other clinical research shows that applying approximately 10 mL of black seed oil to the knees three times weekly for 1 month reduces pain severity when compared to baseline (98814). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for PCOS.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adolescents with PCOS shows that taking black seed 1000 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces ovarian volume, testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities when compared with oral medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily on menstrual cycle days 14 to 23 (114814). The validity of this study is limited by poor methodology, including results presented only using a per-protocol analysis.\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using topical black seed for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical black seed is beneficial for preventing dermatitis caused by radiotherapy.\nClinical research in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment shows that applying a gel containing black seed extract providing thymoquinone 0.01% twice daily delays the incidence of radiation dermatitis and the onset of moist desquamation by 2-6 days when compared with placebo gel. However, there was no effect on the quality of life related to skin condition (101557).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if topical black seed is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of black seed oil (Nigellar, Kahira Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries Company) 500 mg twice daily for one month improves symptoms of RA, such as pain, morning stiffness, and disease severity, when compared with placebo in patients who are already taking methotrexate (94482).\nless\nSenile rhinitis. It is unclear if topical black seed is beneficial for patients with senile rhinitis.\nThe elderly population is particularly susceptible to symptoms of nasal dryness and irritation due to a reduction in mucus production. Preliminary clinical research shows that black seed oil given as 3 sprays into each nostril three times daily for 2 weeks can modestly improve symptoms of nasal dryness, obstruction, and crusting in this population when compared with sodium chloride nasal spray; however, there is no improvement in burning, itching, or nasal mucociliary clearance (95988).\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with stress.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with self-reported stress shows that taking a specific black seed oil extract product containing 5% thymoquinone (BlaQmax, Akay Natural Ingredients) 200 mg daily before bedtime for 90 days reduces measures of perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels when compared with placebo (112244).\nless\nTonsillopharyngitis. Oral black seed has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that the combination of chanca piedra 50 mg and black seed 360 mg, taken orally three times daily for 7 days, may relieve pain in patients with tonsillopharyngitis when compared with placebo (36199).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for patients with ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking black seed powder 2000 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve disease activity scores or symptoms of ulcerative colitis when compared with placebo (100323).\nless\nUrinary incontinence. It is unclear if topical black seed oil is beneficial for patients with urinary incontinence.\nClinical research in postmenopausal females with urinary incontinence shows that topical application with 2-3 drops of black seed oil (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company, Kashan, Iran) on the lower abdomen twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence, as well as related quality of life, when compared to placebo. However, there was no beneficial effect of topical black seed oil on stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or severity of symptoms (110262).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Although there is interest in using intravaginal black seed for vaginal fungal infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black seed for this condition.\nVitiligo. It is unclear if topical black seed oil is beneficial for patients with vitiligo.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with vitiligo shows that applying a cream containing black seed oil to the skin twice daily for 6 months improves skin pigmentation. This cream induced repigmentation of 50% or more in around 44% of patients with facial or hand involvement and 88% of patients with genital region involvement (102064). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced lymphocytopenia. It is unclear if oral black seed is beneficial for preventing febrile neutropenia.\nPreliminary clinical research in children undergoing chemotherapy for brain tumors shows that taking whole or ground black seed 5 grams daily as part of the diet for 3-9 months of chemotherapy reduces the incidence of febrile neutropenia episodes by 88% when compared with placebo. To prevent one case of febrile neutropenia, six patients would need to be treated with black seed. The duration of hospital stay was also reduced by 2.5 days when compared with placebo (96931).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate black seed for these uses.",

This effect may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). However, animal research shows that black seed decreases the maximum concentration of and total systemic exposure to phenytoin by 57% and 87%, respectively. This seems to be related to increased clearance and steady state volume of distribution (110905).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of black seed.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlthough the seed is the most commonly used part of black seed, the root and leaves of the plant are also sometimes used medicinally (96923). Black seed contains oil and an essential or volatile oil. The main fatty acid constituents of the oil include linoleic acid (50% to 60% of the oil) and oleic acid (20%), with lower amounts of palmitic acid and stearic acid (94483, 94486, 94487, 96924, 101554). Constituents of the essential oil include p-cymene, alpha-thujene, trans-anethole, thymol, thymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, dithymoquinone, nigellone, gamma-terpinene, camphene, alpha- and beta-pinene, limonene, sabinene, and carvacrol. Thymoquinone makes up as much as 50%, and p-cymene as much as 40%, of the essential oil. Geography plays a role in the level of thymoquinone in the essential oil, with amounts of approximately 14% found in some varieties (16437, 36180, 94483, 94486, 94491, 96924, 98815, 101554, 110279). Black seed also contains the alkaloids nigellimine, nigellidine, and nigellicine, as well as saponins such as alpha-hederin (18221, 96924). The oil contains various phenols (94487).\nAnalgesic effects\nOral or topical black seed is used traditionally for arthritis, headache, and other pain conditions. Black seed extracts, oil, and constituents have all shown analgesic effects in animal models (36023, 36032, 36064, 36125, 96924). This is likely due to anti-inflammatory or central nervous system (CNS)-depressant constituents of the seed (36064, 36125). Some research suggests a role for opioid receptors (36023).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking black seed improves some symptoms of asthma in patients using maintenance inhalers (36175, 36280, 94490, 95987). Animal research suggests that the constituent thymoquinone induces the relaxation of the trachea, possibly by inhibiting lipoxygenase activity or other inflammatory processes, or by nonselective blocking of the histamine and serotonin (36063, 36241). One clinical study found that taking black seed oil for 4 weeks led to a 15% reduction in serum eosinophil levels in adults with asthma compared to a 5% reduction in those taking placebo; IgE levels were not altered (95987).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of some black seed constituents likely play a role in the potential clinical effects of the seed. Dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, thymol, carvacrol, and thymoquinone, have all been shown to induce anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and/or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in laboratory research (235, 36094, 36118, 36225, 36242, 96924). Some evidence also suggests that black seed constituents reduce the production of some inflammatory cytokines (36171). Most clinical research shows that taking black seed reduces levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) (101552, 102063, 104663, 110261, 110272, 110273, 110275, 110282, 112241). However, findings from meta-analyses of clinical research do not consistently show reductions in all inflammatory factors (102063, 110272, 110273, 112241). Discrepancies may be related to the specific inflammatory factor and/or the type of population studied.\nAnti-ulcer effects\nBlack seed is used to reduce ulcers. Potential mechanisms of action appear to include the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects of black seed constituents such as thymoquinone, anti-bacterial effects against H. pylori, or protection of the stomach lining against acid (36121, 36129, 94487). Antihistamine, antioxidant, and antiperoxidase effects of various black seed constituents might play a role (96924).\nAntiallergic effects\nBlack seed has demonstrated antiallergic effects in human research (36071, 95989, 96921). Black seed seems to have a positive effect on the number and activity of lymphocytes in patients with allergic rhinitis (96921). Although not yet demonstrated in humans, low concentrations of the constituent nigellone have been shown to inhibit the release of histamine from mast cells in animals (233).\nAntianxiety effects\nIn animal research, black seed extract had anxiolytic effects, possibly related to increased brain levels of serotonin (36233).\nAnticancer effects\nBlack seed is used as an anticancer agent. According to preliminary studies, black seed may inhibit stomach tumors, carcinoma, and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (236, 239). The constituent thymoquinone possibly plays a role. It has been shown to interfere with various metabolic pathways in cancer cells and induces apoptosis (36047, 36089, 36124, 36222, 96924). Furthermore, there is some evidence from laboratory models that a combination of thymoquinone and chemotherapeutic agents, like doxorubicin or cisplatin, has a greater effect than chemotherapy alone (96924). Another possible active constituent in black seed is the saponin alpha-hederin (36030, 96924).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nIn human research, black seed had anticonvulsant effects in children already using antiepileptic agents (36180). Both the oil and the constituent thymoquinone had antiepileptogenic effects in animal models (36076, 36098, 36108, 96924). Animal research suggests that possible mechanism of action might be related to a selective alteration in monoamine, such as serotonin and dopamine, levels in the brain (36180). Black seed oil has been shown to increase brain serotonin levels in animal research (94488). Some research suggests that the anticonvulsant effect of black seed is related to antioxidant activity of constituents (36180, 96924).\nAntidepressant effects\nPossible antidepressant effects of black seed oil may be related to increased brain serotonin levels as shown in animal research (94488).\nAntidiabetic effects\nResults from animal research and clinical studies show that taking black seed can reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome (36262, 94479, 94485, 96924, 110269, 110270, 110276). The mechanism of action may be related to increased production and activity of insulin, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and having cytoprotective effects (94485, 96924).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe essential oil of black seed may have antimicrobial and anthelmintic activity, particularly against staphylococcus as well as other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (243, 1516, 96924). Black seed extract and oil have also been shown to have antifungal effects, especially against Candida and Aspergillus species, possibly by inhibiting the germination of dermatophyte arthrospores (243, 36099, 36127, 36229, 96924).\nAntioxidant effects\nMeta-analyses of clinical research and individual clinical trials show that taking black seed oil or black seed powder 500-3000 mg daily for 6-52 weeks increases levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (101539, 110272, 110273, 112241, 114880). However, evidence related to the effects of black seed on malondialdehyde levels, total antioxidant capacity, or other measures of antioxidant status is mixed (101539, 101547, 104663, 110272, 110273, 112241).\nAntiparasitic effects\nBlack seeds have been used historically for parasites. Black seed extract has shown anti-parasitic effects against various types of parasites, possibly by inhibiting egg-laying (36178, 36192, 36328).\nCytotoxic effects\nThe black seed constituents thymoquinone and dithymoquinone are cytotoxic toward human cells (238).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome evidence suggests thymoquinone may offer protection against chemically induced hepatotoxicity (237, 240), with one clinical study showing a possible hepatoprotective effect in children receiving methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (95984). In addition, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking black seed as oil or powder has beneficial effects on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels when used for at least 12 weeks. There was no effect on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (101553). Potential hepatoprotective effects are likely due to decreased oxidative stress (36230, 36303). However, one study in rats indicates that black seed may be hepatotoxic (245), although a separate study in rats demonstrated no hepatotoxic effect after 6 weeks of treatment with black seed oil (95982).\nHypolipidemic effects\nSome research suggests that black seed modestly reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (18221, 94484). These benefits have also been shown in some animal research, reducing LDL and triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol at similar rates to simvastatin (95982, 96924). These effects appear to be related to the constituent thymoquinone or to the oil (36018, 36028, 36315). Thymoquinone might induce the cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis via the suppression of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene (36261).\nHypotensive effects\nSome animal and human research suggests that black seed and its constituents might reduce blood pressure (16437, 94489, 96924, 101559). Potential mechanisms of action include diuresis, regulation of endothelial function, or inhibition of calcium channels. The diuretic effects of black seed might also play a role. Thymoquinone or constituent fatty acids might be involved (94489, 96924). However, other constituents of black seed might also be responsible (36301).\nImmunological effects\nBlack seed is thought to have immunoprotective effects. Preliminary evidence suggests it may help minimize chemotherapy-induced decreases in hemoglobin and leukocyte counts. It may also enhance the production of interleukin-1-beta and interleukin-6 and alter macrophages (234, 112244). Animal research suggests that black seed volatile oil affects counts and activity of neutrophils and other lymphocytes (36085, 36086, 36142, 96924, 112244). It might also reduce the production of antibodies (94481). A study in healthy adults shows that taking black seed oil extract increases serum immunoglobulin concentrations of IgG and IgM, CD4+, CD4/CD8, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes, and decreases neutrophils, eosinophils, interleukin-10, and CD8+ cells (112244).\nMemory effects\nThere is some evidence that black seed might improve cognitive performance in humans (96915, 96928). In animal models, black seed oil or extract were found to enhance learning and memory (96924). Black seed constituents might protect against cell loss and neurodegeneration (96915).\nPulmonary effects\nBlack seed is traditionally used for respiratory disorders. Laboratory research suggests that black seed can relax tracheal smooth muscle. The essential oil of black seed has antagonistic effects on the muscarinic receptor and inhibitory effects on the histamine (H1) receptor and calcium channel, and stimulates receptors involved in smooth muscle relaxation. The anti-inflammatory effects of thymoquinone possibly has play a role (96924).\nRenoprotective effects\nBlack seed might be beneficial for kidney health. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking black seed as oil or powder has beneficial effects on blood urea nitrogen levels. However, there was no effect on creatinine, uric acid, or bilirubin. In addition, blood urea nitrogen levels were increased with doses of over 2 grams daily (101553). In various animal models, black seed has demonstrated renoprotective effects (36015, 36083, 36184, 36279, 36208, 36298). Research in rats also shows that administration of black seed 100-200 mg/kg for 5 days prior to administration of cisplatin can protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (100326). Antioxidant effects might play a role in this activity (36184, 36221, 100326).\nSmooth muscle relaxant effects\nBlack seed may have anti-oxytocic potential, and may inhibit spontaneous contractions (241). Smooth muscle relaxant effects have been shown in animal or laboratory models, possibly due to interference with calcium (31503, 36322).\nSperm effects\nBlack seed oil seems to benefit sperm function. This might be related to the antioxidant effects of back seed constituents or the unsaturated essential fatty acids found in the oil (94486).\nThyroid effects\nThe black seed constituent thymoquinone has an effect on thyroid hormones, possibly also improving thyroid health. Beneficial effects are related to a reduction in oxidative stress. Black seed also seems to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which plays a role in metabolic disorders (94481).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human and animal research, black seed has appetite suppressant effects (98815, 104661). In animal research, black seed increases energy expenditure and stimulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPAR-gamma-2), which is involved in energy homeostasis (98815)."

    "Black Tea": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Camellia sinensis is a woody plant (89481). The dried leaves and leaf buds are used to produce various types of teas, including black tea, green tea, and oolong tea (4218, 89481). Black tea, the most commonly consumed tea, and oolong tea involve processes in which the leaves are fermented (black tea) or partially fermented (oolong tea). Green tea uses unfermented leaves (4218). Due to fermentation processes, black tea and green tea have different chemical constituents (8115). Black tea has been used as a diuretic and an aphrodisiac.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed orally in moderate amounts (1452, 9222, 9223, 9224, 9228, 9233, 9234, 9235, 9236, 36376)(36426, 36434, 36436, 36581). Black tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 4 cups of black tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when consumed orally long term or in high amounts. Black tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg per day, or approximately 6 cups of black tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances (11832). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated black tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as black tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when consumed orally in very high amounts. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, prior caffeine use, etc. (11832).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used in food and beverage amounts (4912, 11833).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of black tea, mothers should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Caffeine crosses the human placenta but is not considered a teratogen. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 11733, 16014, 16015, 37802, 37584). In some studies, consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in females with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy patients can safely consume doses up to 300 mg daily during pregnancy without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of black tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as black tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from black tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of black tea. High doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711, 24995, 24998, 37561, 37898, 38012, 38186, 38199, 38212)(38285, 38290). Preliminary evidence from a population study also suggests that increasing consumption of black tea might increase the risk of spina bifida (15112); however, this finding needs to be verified with additional research.\nPREGNANCY: Cohort studies suggest that consuming large amounts of caffeine during pregnancy may reduce the height and weight of the infants born as they grow up. In a cohort of mother/infant pairs with a median maternal plasma caffeine level of 168.5 ng/mL (range 29.5-650.5 ng/mL) during pregnancy, birth weights and lengths were lower in the 4th quartile of caffeine intake compared with the 1st. By age 7, heights and weights were lower by 1.5 cm and 1.1 kg respectively. In another cohort of mother/infant pairs with higher maternal pregnancy plasma caffeine levels, median 625.5 ng/mL (range 86.2 to 1994.7 ng/mL), heights at age 8 were 2.2 cm lower, but there was no difference in weights (109846).\nPREGNANCY: Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as black tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using black tea during pregnancy. For now, advise avoidance of large quantities of black tea during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of black tea, caffeine intake should be closely monitored. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations. Minimal consumption would likely result in limited exposure to a nursing infant (9892).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of black tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants (6026). Black tea might also interfere with iron metabolism and folic acid bioavailability in nursing infants (631, 53782). Large doses or excessive intake of black tea should be avoided during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, black tea is well tolerated when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Many of the adverse effects of black tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as diuresis, gastric irritation, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, restlessness, tachycardia, tachypnea, tremors, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Many of the adverse effects of black tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as arrhythmia, chest pain, convulsions, delirium, premature heartbeat, and respiratory alkalosis. Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, black tea can cause some cardiovascular-related adverse events. Some of these effects may be due to the caffeine content of black tea. Acute administration of black tea can cause increased blood pressure. However, regular consumption does not seem to increase blood pressure or pulse, even in patients with mild hypertension (1451, 1452, 2722). Also, epidemiological research suggests that there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension (13739).\n\nBlack tea, which contains caffeine, may cause other adverse cardiovascular effects when used orally. These effects include tachycardia, tachypnea, chest pain, premature heartbeat, arrhythmia, and hypertension (2729, 11832, 11838, 13735). Large doses of caffeine can also cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia (13734).\n\nThere is evidence that daily consumption of strong black tea (2 liters) or black tea solids (4 grams) can raise plasma homocysteine levels. It is unclear if lower doses have this effect (8035). Some epidemiological research has linked tea consumption with ischemic heart disease and total mortality (220, 36339). Combining caffeinated beverages such as black tea with ephedra may theoretically increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed ephedra 40-60 mg, creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275).\nless\nDental\nOrally, black tea may cause tooth surface loss and teeth staining (36370).\nless\nEndocrine\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis (13734).\n\nSome evidence shows caffeine is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis. However, other research has not supported this finding (8043). Restricting caffeine in females with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages such as black tea and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of two low-quality observational studies found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, caffeine in black tea can cause gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting (11832, 11838, 13735). Some believe that long-term use of caffeine can cause withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of use. However, the existence of caffeine withdrawal is controversial. Some researchers think that if it exists, it appears to be of little clinical significance (11839). Gastrointestinal withdrawal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant gastrointestinal symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, caffeine in black tea can cause hypokalemia (11832, 11838, 13735). In infants, black tea can cause microcytic anemia (631).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, caffeine in black tea can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nSome epidemiological research suggests that caffeine, which is found in black tea, may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, but conflicting evidence exists. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake, less than 300 mg per day, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317).\n\nSome researchers believe that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as muscle tension and muscle pains. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, caffeine in black tea can cause insomnia, nervousness, headache, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, restlessness, ringing in the ears, tremors, delirium, and convulsions (11832, 11838, 13735). Caffeine may also exacerbate sleep disturbances in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10204).\n\nThere is some concern that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as headache; tiredness and fatigue; decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness; drowsiness; decreased contentedness; depressed mood; difficulty concentrating; irritability; and lack of clear-headedness are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). Other symptoms such as delirium, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some evidence that consumption of black tea (greater than 1 cup per day) may increase the risk of colon and rectal cancers (8041, 36482). Drinking 3 or more cups daily has been shown to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer (36507). In addition, drinking black tea more than once a day, drinking strong black tea, or using more than 300 grams of tea leaves per month is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of esophageal cancer when compared with drinking black tea up to once daily, drinking mild to moderate black tea, or using up to 300 grams of tea leaves per month (102756). Some evidence also shows caffeine, which is found in black tea, is associated with breast cancer in females. However, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, caffeine in black tea may cause tachypnea-induced respiratory alkalosis (11832, 11838, 13735). Some researchers think that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as runny nose. However, this symptom may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, caffeine in black tea may cause diuresis (11832, 11838, 13735).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nMental alertness. Consumption of black tea can improve or prevent declines in mental alertness, attention, and cognitive capacity.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy people shows that consumption of black tea containing caffeine 30-100 mg, as well as other caffeinated beverages, throughout the day prevents a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when compared with placebo (4221, 4224, 92404). Also, some preliminary clinical research in healthy people shows black tea can improve attention. The effect may be dose-dependent, with greater effects observed in patients consuming black tea that contains higher concentrations of caffeine and theanine (92404). Caffeine can improve mental performance and alertness following prolonged sleep deprivation (10205). Combining caffeine with taurine seems to provide a small improvement in mental performance (9899). Combining caffeine with glucose as an \"energy drink\" seems to improve mental performance when compared with placebo or either caffeine or glucose alone (13732).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypotension. Consumption of black tea seems to increase blood pressure in older patients with postprandial hypotension.\nSeveral clinical studies in older adults with postprandial hypotension show that drinking caffeinated beverages such as black tea seems to increase blood pressure in the short-term when compared with placebo or not drinking caffeinated beverages (11834, 11835).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Consumption of black tea seems to be associated with a reduced risk of MI.\nThere is some evidence that people who consume at least one cup of black tea daily have a lower risk of MI when compared with not drinking tea (4222, 8119, 8121). Consuming black tea for at least one year before a heart attack also seems to be associated with a 28% to 44% reduced risk of subsequent death when compared with not drinking tea (8120).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Consumption of black tea seems to have beneficial effects on bone health.\nPopulation research suggests that consuming black tea is associated with increased bone mineral density, especially in older females aged 65-76 years and those whose habitual tea consumption extends beyond 10 years, when compared with not drinking tea (6404, 8116). Black tea consumption also seems to be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in adults aged 50 years or more (10949, 15014).\nless\nOvarian cancer. Consumption of black tea seems to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer.\nAdults who regularly consume tea, including black tea or green tea, appear to have a significantly lower risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared with those who never or seldom consume tea (9228, 13208). In one prospective population study, adults who consume at least 2 cups of tea daily have a 46% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared with those who do not regularly consume tea (13208).\nless\nParkinson disease. Consumption of black tea seems to be associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson disease.\nSome evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies suggests that consuming caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and cola, is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson disease. For males, the effects seem to be dose related. For example, males consuming 421-2716 mg of total caffeine (equivalent to 5-33 cups of black tea) from any source daily seem to have the greatest reduction in risk. However, there seems to be a significant reduction in risk even with consumption of as little as 124-208 mg of total caffeine (equivalent to 1-3 cups of black tea) daily (6022). In females, the effects do not seem to be dose related. Moderate consumption of caffeine (equivalent to 1-4 cups black tea daily) seems to provide the most reduction in risk (1238). Also, drinking tea appears to be associated with a reduced incidence of Parkinson disease among people who smoke when compared with almost never drinking tea (9236).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBladder cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of urinary tract cancers, including bladder cancer.\nObservational research has found that drinking tea, including black and green tea, is not associated with a reduced risk of urinary tract cancers, including bladder cancer, when compared with those who almost never drink black tea (36482, 36561).\nless\nBreast cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.\nObservational research has found that drinking black tea is not associated with a lower risk of breast cancer when compared with not drinking black tea (9235, 92406).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.\nSome population research has found that drinking tea, including black tea or green tea, might be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer when compared with little or no tea consumption (9234, 36535). However, most research has found that drinking tea is not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (9222, 9223, 9234, 36385, 36416, 36474, 36535, 36553, 36582). Additionally, some population research has found that increased consumption of black tea is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with those who almost never drink black tea (8041, 36482).\nless\nDiabetes. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of diabetes and does not seem to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that taking an extract of black and green tea daily for 3 months does not reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) when compared with placebo (36434). Additionally, population research in Japanese adults has found that drinking at least 1 cup of black tea daily does not seem to be associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily (14313).\nless\nEndometrial cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer.\nA meta-analysis of results from population research has found that increasing black tea intake by 1 cup per day is not associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer when compare with no or low black tea consumption (92409).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of results from population research has found that people who drink higher amounts of black tea do not have a reduced risk of esophageal cancer when compared with those who drink lesser amounts (90186). However, some population research has found that drinking large amounts of strong black tea is associated with a two-fold INCREASED risk for esophageal cancer when compared with people who drink less black tea (102756).\nless\nGastric cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer.\nWhile some epidemiological evidence has found that increased consumption of tea, including black or green tea, is associated with a reduced risk of stomach cancer (36561), most evidence shows that drinking tea is not associated with a reduced stomach cancer risk (9222, 9223, 36553, 36333). Additionally, some epidemiological evidence has found that consumption of tea may be associated with an increased risk of mortality due to stomach cancer when compared with nonregular tea consumption (36474).\nless\nLung cancer. Consumption of black tea does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer.\nMost population research found that drinking up to 5 cups of black tea daily is not associated with reduced risk of lung cancer (36474, 36553, 90177, 97128). One population study even found an increase in risk of lung cancer associated with tea consumption, including black and green tea, when compared with nonregular tea consumption. However, this study did not adjust for the patients' baseline smoking status and carcinogen exposure (36474).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. Consumption of black tea seems to be associated with a reduced risk of severe, but not mild or moderate, aortic atherosclerosis.\nEpidemiological research has found that increased intake of brewed black tea (125-500 mL or 1-4 cups) is associated with a reduced risk of severe aortic atherosclerosis, especially in females. However, black tea intake is not associated with a reduced risk of mild or moderate aortic atherosclerosis (3450).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Consumption of black tea may be associated with a modest reduction in CVD-related mortality.\nA prospective cohort study of nearly 500,000 adults 40-69 years of age in the United Kingdom Biobank shows that black tea intake in quantities greater than 1 cup daily is associated with a modestly reduced rate of CVD-related mortality over a mean follow-up of about 11 years. Consuming anywhere between 2-9 cups of black tea daily resulted in similar hazard ratios; consuming 10 or more cups per day may be associated with a further reduction in risk (108970).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if black tea is associated with a reduced risk of COPD.\nOne prospective, observational study in older adults has found that consumption of at least 3 cups daily of tea, including black tea, oolong tea, and green tea, is associated with a 23% reduced risk of COPD prevalence and a 65% reduced risk of developing COPD in models adjusted for potential confounders when compared with the lowest tea consumption (107201).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if black tea is associated with a reduced risk of CHD or CHD-related mortality.\nAlthough a meta-analysis of population research found that general tea consumption might protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) or death from CVD, a sub-group analysis has found that drinking black tea does not seem to offer protection (102728). In fact, some individual population research found that black tea consumption is associated with an increased incidence of CHD progression and CHD mortality in those with existing CHD (220, 36339). In contrast, observational research in healthy adults has found that those who drink black tea regularly have a decreased risk of developing CHD (7726, 36363, 36391, 36420).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if black tea, consumed in conjunction with coffee, is associated with a reduced risk of dementia.\nA prospective, observational study suggests consumption of tea, including black tea, of at least 4 cups with 0.5-1 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 30% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea or coffee. Also, drinking 2-3 cups daily of both tea and coffee is associated with a 28% reduced risk of dementia stroke when compared with not drinking tea and coffee (107204).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if black tea is associated with a reduced risk of depression.\nObservational research in healthy adult office workers without a history of anxiety or depression has found that consumption of at least 1-4 cups daily of black tea, as well as caffeine from other sources, is associated with a 41% to 61% reduced risk of depression scores in multiple models adjusted for potential confounders (107202). Another observational study in older adults suggests that habitual black tea consumption is associated with 50% lower odds of having depressive symptoms when compared with those who never consume tea. This association follows a dose-response pattern, with the greatest reduction in depressive symptoms found in those who drink black tea more frequently, in larger amounts, and for longer durations of many years. While the study suggests that social engagement such as drinking tea in a teahouse or restaurant with other people may mediate the association between other types of tea such as oolong or green tea and depressive symptoms, mild black tea consumption for a duration of 6-9 years and for ≥160 cup-years is associated with lower odds of having depressive symptoms independently of social engagement (112235). Since this study was conducted in Chinese adults, it is unclear if the findings are generalizable to other populations.\nless\nDiarrhea. Black tea seems to improve stool consistency in children with acute nonbacterial diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with acute nonbacterial diarrhea shows that taking a one-time dose of black tea 500-1000 mg as tablets dissolved in water improves stool consistency after 24 hours when compared with placebo (97126).\nless\nHalitosis. It is unclear if black tea is beneficial in patients with halitosis.\nA very small study in healthy adults shows that rinsing with 10 mL of black tea for 30 seconds following L-cysteine-induced halitosis improves the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds in breath samples when compared with baseline. These concentrations also were improved at 2 hours, but not at 1 hour, when compared with control. It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups (107203).\nless\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in consuming black tea for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black tea for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. The evidence for the benefits of black tea in reducing cholesterol is conflicting.\nOne small clinical study in mildly hypercholesterolemic adults shows that drinking black tea reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (36401). However, other studies have found that drinking black tea or taking black tea extract does not reduce cholesterol or triglyceride levels in healthy people or in those with cardiovascular risk factors (36376, 36436, 36581, 36592).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical research also report conflicting findings. Several meta-analyses in healthy people and in patients with coronary artery disease or hypercholesterolemia suggest that drinking black tea or taking black tea extract does not reduce total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (92407, 102738). However, several other small meta-analyses of clinical studies in healthy people or those at risk for cardiovascular disease show that drinking black tea 3-5 servings daily or taking black tea extract 1-6 grams daily for up to 6 months modestly reduces LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (90146, 92408). Reasons for the conflicting findings are not entirely clear. One analysis suggests that black tea has a greater effect on LDL cholesterol in patients with higher cardiovascular risks than those who are healthy (92408). The effect of black tea on cholesterol levels does not appear to be influenced by the duration of treatment or the type of black tea used (tea leaf vs. tea extract) (92407, 92408).\nless\nHypertension. Consumption of black tea seems to modestly reduce blood pressure, although any effect may not be considered clinically significant.\nMost epidemiological research and some meta-analyses of clinical research show that consumption of 3-5 cups of black tea daily or black tea extracts 6 grams daily for up to 6 months can modestly reduce blood pressure, although any benefits are not likely to be considered clinically significant (36400, 90146, 92405, 104582, 104583). One meta-analysis of clinical research in a mixed population with normotension, hypertension, coronary artery disease, mild hypercholesterolemia, or at high risk of cardiovascular disease shows that taking black tea 300-1800 mL daily for 7 days to 6 months reduces systolic blood pressure by about 1.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 0.8 mmHg when compared with control (104582). Other analyses show similar reductions of up to 2 mmHg (90146, 92405). However, the effect in patients with hypertension is unclear because this population is rarely analyzed separately. In a meta-analysis of three clinical trials limited to patients with hypertension, and excluding studies related to purified black tea extracts or isolated components, there was no statistically significant effect on blood pressure when compared with control (104583).\n\nInterestingly, most of the individual clinical studies in these analyses did NOT find a reduction in blood pressure from black tea consumption (104582). This might be because most of these studies had a short duration (1452, 36376, 36581, 104583) or were underpowered to detect a modest effect (36436). Furthermore, these studies did not use out-of-office blood pressure monitoring, such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). A robust clinical study using ABPM in patients with normotension and hypertension shows that drinking 3 cups of black tea (1493 mg powdered black tea solids containing 429 mg of polyphenols) daily for 6 months results in about 2 mmHg reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (97127).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if consumption of black tea is beneficial for the prevention of kidney stones.\nPopulation research suggests that consuming one 8 oz cup of tea, such as black tea, daily is associated with an 8% decreased risk of developing kidney stones in females (4216). However, a very small clinical study in healthy adults without a history of kidney stones shows that drinking 1.5 liters of black tea standardized to contain oxalate 86 mg daily for 5 days does not increase urinary risk factors for kidney stone formation when compared with control (112248). The validity of these effects is limited by the very small sample size. Additionally, it is unclear if these findings may be due to the caffeine content in black tea, as opposed to black tea itself.\nless\nOral cancer. Although there has been interest in consuming black tea for oral cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of black tea for this purpose.\nOverall mortality. Consuming black tea may be associated with a modest reduction in overall mortality.\nA prospective cohort study of nearly 500,000 adults between 40-69 years of age in the United Kingdom Biobank shows that consuming black tea in quantities greater than 1 cup daily is associated with a modestly reduced all-cause mortality over a mean follow-up of about 11 years. Increasing consumption beyond 2-3 cups per day does not further reduce overall mortality rate (108970).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if consumption of black tea is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.\nOne prospective, observational study has found that Japanese males who drink more than 1 cup of black tea daily are not at a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer when compared with those who almost never drink black tea (36482). However, another observational study in Polish males has found that increased tea consumption over a lifetime is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (36550).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if maternal consumption of black tea reduces the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nA retrospective cohort study in pregnant adults without chronic hypertension suggests that tea consumption at any point during pregnancy is associated with 44% increased odds of pregnancy-induced hypertension, 86% increased odds of gestational hypertension, and 193% increased odds of early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE). Subgroup analysis suggests that timing affects this association, with those who drink tea in the first trimester more likely to develop gestational hypertension, while those who drink tea in the second semester are more likely to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension. Exposure time may also influence the association, with those who begin drinking tea prior to pregnancy lacking a significant risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension, while those who begin drinking tea during pregnancy are at an increased risk. In those who drink tea during pregnancy, maternal characteristics may also mediate the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension. There is a greater risk observed in pregnant adults with overweight or obesity before pregnancy or those having multiple births. The odds of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension with black tea are much higher than with green tea or herbal tea (112246). The validity of these findings is limited by the use of a retrospective chart review. Since this study was conducted in Chinese adults, it is unclear if the findings are generalizable to other populations.\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if consumption of black tea is beneficial for reducing the risk of prostate cancer.\nObservational research has found that black tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer when compared with those who almost never drink black tea (36482).\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if consumption of black tea is beneficial for reducing the risk of kidney cancer.\nProspective, observational research in males has found that drinking higher amounts of tea, including black and green tea, is associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer when compared with nonregular tea consumption (36474).\nless\nStress. It is unclear if consumption of black tea is beneficial for reducing stress.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, nonsmoking males shows that drinking black tea daily for 6 weeks does not improve blood pressure, heart rate, or subjective stress ratings in response to stressful tasks when compared with placebo (36426).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if consumption of black tea is associated with a reduced risk of stroke or death from stroke.\nSeveral prospective, observational studies have found that higher intake of tea, including black tea, is associated with a decreased incidence of stroke when compared with lower intake (7716, 107204), as well as a modestly reduced risk of stroke-related mortality (108970). Consumption of at least 2 cups daily of tea, including black tea, is associated with a 16% reduced risk of stroke when compared with drinking no tea. Drinking 2-3 cups daily of both tea and coffee is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking either of these beverages. The combination of 0.5-1 cups of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea daily, but not tea alone, also is associated with a 50% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee (107204).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate black tea for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBlack tea is most often consumed as a beverage in amounts of 1-4 cups daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nBlack tea can interfere with the absorption of iron in the diet of people who are iron-deficient. People who are iron-deficient should avoid drinking black tea (631, 9237, 24980).\n\nAdding milk to black tea might reduce some of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of drinking tea, potentially by binding with and reducing the absorption of flavonoids (220, 6032, 15219, 99778). More evidence is needed to determine the clinical significance of this potential interaction.\nChildren\nResearch is limited; typical dosing unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost clinical studies administer black tea as a tea beverage or as black tea extract (90146). Black tea extract has been used in capsule form or as a soluble dehydrated powder to be dissolved in water (90146).\n\nOften black tea is standardized to caffeine content or theaflavin content. In general, black tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519). Typically, black tea contains more caffeine than non-fermented green teas (14129). Theaflavins make up about 2% of dried black tea (15656).",

Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level (38172). However, caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nALCOHOL (Ethanol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029, 36425). Theoretically, the caffeine in black tea might increase the risk of bleeding when used concomitantly with antiplatelet drugs. However, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking black tea with antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

Animal research suggests that caffeine can lower the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and can induce seizures when taken in doses above 400 mg/kg (23559, 23561). Human research has shown that taking caffeine 300 mg in three divided doses along with carbamazepine 200 mg reduces the bioavailability of carbamazepine by 32% and prolongs the plasma half-life of carbamazepine 2-fold in healthy individuals (23562).\nless\nCIMETIDINE (Tagamet)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine in black tea.\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Cimetidine can reduces caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% (11736, 24700).\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, black tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms.\nConcomitant administration of black tea and clozapine might theoretically cause acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to the caffeine in black tea. Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients be more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine (13741).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in black tea.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

Caffeine is metabolized by CYP1A2 (3941, 5051, 11741, 23557, 23573, 23580, 24958, 24959, 24960, 24962), (24964, 24965, 24967, 24968, 24969, 24971, 38081, 48603). Theoretically, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 may decrease the clearance rate of caffeine from black tea and increase caffeine levels.\nless\nDIPYRIDAMOLE (Persantine)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, black tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole and interfere with its use prior to stress testing.\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is a methylxanthine that may inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation (11770, 11772, 24974, 37985, 53795). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products such as black tea, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). Methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nDISULFIRAM (Antabuse)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, disulfiram might increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

Caffeine, especially in excessive amounts, can reduce potassium levels due to stimulation of the sodium-potassium pump (23579, 37905, 37953, 38003, 38034). Diuretics can also cause lower potassium levels.\nless\nEPHEDRINE\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk for simulant adverse effects.\nBlack tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedrine with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death (6486, 9740, 10307).

Caffeine has been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B in laboratory studies (37724, 37877, 37912, 38108). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis (15).

Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of valproate (23558, 23559, 23561). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear.\nless\nVERAPAMIL (Calan, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

There is some concern that combining caffeine, ephedra, and creatine might increase the risk of serious adverse effects. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). Caffeine might also decrease creatine's possible beneficial effects on athletic performance.

In healthy individuals, taking echinacea 400 mg daily for 8 days seems to inhibit the oral clearance of caffeine (23581). This effect seems to be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nEPHEDRA (Ma huang)\nConcomitant use increases the risk for adverse stimulant effects.\nBlack tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedra with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death (6486, 9740, 10307). Tell patients to avoid taking black tea with ephedra and other stimulants.\nless\nFOLIC ACID\nConcomitant use may reduce activity and bioavailability of supplementary folic acid.\nBlack tea appears to reduce the bioavailability of folate in humans (53782).\nless\nGENISTEIN-CONTAINING HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Taking genistein 1 gram daily for 14 days seems to inhibit caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy females (23582). This effect has been attributed to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nIRON\nTheoretically, concomitant use might reduce the absorption of non-heme iron from supplements.\nBlack tea appears to reduce absorption of non-heme iron from foods (8904, 24980). Infants given tea to drink have an increased risk of microcytic anemia (631). However, a study of iron-deficient elderly patients suggests that concomitant use doesn't alter iron absorption in this population. Theoretically, black tea might reduce the absorption of iron supplements. For most patients, this effect will not be clinically significant. Advise patients with iron deficiency to consume tea between meals rather than with meals to lessen this interaction (8904).\nless\nKUDZU\nTheoretically, kudzu might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nBlack tea contains caffeine.

Use with caution.\nless\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\nUse with caution in patients with bleeding disorders. Black tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029, 36425), although this interaction has not been reported in humans. Caffeine can prolong bleeding time and increase the results of a bleeding time test (1701).\nless\nCARDIAC CONDITIONS\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which can induce cardiac arrhythmias in sensitive individuals (11845, 36511). Use with caution. Caffeine has been reported to both increase and decrease heart rate, although this is not thought to be clinically significant at doses below 400 mg, or approximately 8 cups of green tea, daily (98806).\nless\nDIABETES\nBlack tea contains caffeine. Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646); use with caution. Some evidence in healthy individuals suggests that drinking black tea reduces blood glucose levels (92403). Some research suggests that caffeine (a constituent of black tea) may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages such as black tea and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine in black tea may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in people with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nUse with caution in patients with diarrhea. Black tea contains caffeine, which can exacerbate diarrhea, especially when taken in large amounts (100523).\nless\nEPILEPSY\nPatients with epilepsy should avoid using high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing supplements; low doses should be used with caution. Black tea contains caffeine. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563). However, caffeine does not seem to affect the anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine, tiagabine, or oxcarbazepine (23561).\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nUse with caution in patients with glaucoma.

Because black tea might have weak estrogenic effects (6404), those with hormone-sensitive conditions should avoid high doses of black tea.\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nUse with caution in patients with hypertension. The caffeine in black tea might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this doesn't seem to occur in people who consume black tea or other caffeinated products regularly (1451, 1452, 2722, 15655, 36468, 36515, 36539, 36556).\nless\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)\nUse with caution in patients with IBS. Black tea contains caffeine, which might worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS, especially when taken in large amounts (100526).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which can increase urinary excretion of calcium. Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg daily (approximately 2-3 cups of black tea), unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intake equivalent to approximately 4 cups of black tea (11733, 98806). Postmenopausal adults with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine (2669).\nless",

In one case report, intake of about 2 L black tea daily led to falsely positive elevations of CA 19-9 and CA 125 levels in a 34-year-old female (102757). In addition, observational research has found that consuming large amounts of black tea, 1.5-2 L daily, is associated with CA 19-9 levels ranging between 69-105 U/mL, which is above the normal value of 40 U/mL (97125).Clinicians should be aware of these elevations when they are using carbohydrate antigens to aid in diagnosis and evaluation.\nless\nDIPYRIDAMOLE THALLIUM IMAGING\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which might interfere with dipyridamole thallium imaging studies.

Caffeine can increase the linearity of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that is used in most fMRI studies (23587).\nless\nNEUROBLASTOMA TESTS\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15) and might cause false-positive diagnosis of neuroblastoma when diagnosis is based on tests of urine VMA or catecholamine concentrations.\nless\nPHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which can interfere with pharmacological stress tests. The caffeine in black tea is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors (11771). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nBlack tea contains caffeine, which can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15) and might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma when diagnosis is based on tests of urine VMA or catecholamine concentrations.\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nPeople may need to avoid caffeine and caffeinated beverages, such as black tea, for at least 4 hours prior to lung function testing. Forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) seems to show a small improvement up to 2 hours after caffeine use. Mid-expiratory flow rates may also improve with caffeine for up to 4 hours (9607).\nless\nURATE\nBlack tea, which contains caffeine, might falsely increase serum urate test results determined by the Bittner method (11844).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nBlack tea contains caffeine and theoretically may have similar toxic effects as caffeine if taken in high doses. In fatal overdose related to caffeine, the cause of death is usually ventricular fibrillation (11838).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose from black tea.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe absorption of various tea constituents has been examined in human research. Catechins from black tea are rapidly absorbed, peaking between 5-24 hours. Milk does not appear to impair their bioavailability (36594, 36332, 36358, 36608). Bioavailability of oxalates from tea are low, ranging from 0.03% to 2.3% (36395, 36460, 112248).\nDistribution\nIn human research, tea polyphenols have been found in the prostate following consumption of black tea (36419).\nMetabolism\nDuring the first trimester of pregnancy, caffeine is rapidly metabolized in as little as 3 hours, primarily to paraxanthine. Metabolism gradually slows and can take up to 10 hours by the third trimester. Caffeine is not metabolized by the fetus and can therefore accumulate in fetal tissue (109846).\nExcretion\nIn humans, consumption of black tea has resulted in increased urinary hippuric acid and 1,3-dihydroxyphenyl-2-O-sulfate (36343, 36409, 36424), quercetin (36597), methylgallic acid (36348, 36379), epigallocatechin, epicatechin (36358), citrate, and oxalate (112248) excretion. Following the intake of 1.5 liters daily of black tea, urinary oxalate excretion increased by 0.031 mmol/day, suggesting oxalate bioavailability from black tea to be 3.2%. Urinary citrate excretion increased by 21% over 24-hours (112248). The relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate, uric acid, and struvite are also excreted in urine (112248). Epigallocatechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate are also excreted in feces (36358).\n\nFlavan-3-ols in black tea are metabolized in a dose-dependent manner into 2 main phenyl-gamma-valerolactones (PVLs) accounting for more than 75% of the compounds excreted, a hydroxylated PVL with a sulfate conjugate and a hydroxylated PVL with a glucuronide conjugate. Minor metabolites include PVLs with various hydroxylation patterns with sulfate and/or glucuronide conjugates. After repeated days of black tea exposure, there was no urinary accumulation of urinary PVLs and PVL levels quickly return to negligible amounts after dietary exposure of flavanols is removed (112247).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of black tea are the leaf and stem. Black tea is different than green and oolong teas. Black tea is fully fermented. Oolong tea is partially fermented. Green tea is not fermented.\n\nPolyphenols such as flavonoids including catechins, thearubigins, and theaflavins are abundant in black tea, and are thought to be responsible for many of its proposed benefits as an antioxidant (6032, 6033, 9232, 92403, 36349, 36607). The amount of polyphenols and catechins in black tea is affected by growing conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport (14129). Theaflavins are reddish-brown pigments produced from catechins during the fermentation process. They make up about 2% of dried black tea (15656). Black tea also contains tannins, which may have antioxidant effects (15656). Black tea also contains phytoestrogens including beta-sitosterol and the lignan precursors matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol (13190). Generally, black tea contains more caffeine than non-fermented green teas (14129). Black tea also contains significant amounts of gallic acid and the amino acid theanine (8123, 92403, 92404).\nAnti-cancer effects\nBlack tea and its constituents may have anti-cancer effects. Anti-cancer effects of black tea have been shown in animal models. Black tea appears to decrease the potential for the development of both nonmalignant and malignant tumors (36334, 36361, 36375, 36566, 36574, 36585). Some researchers have suggested that decreased tissue fat may play a role in the decreased carcinogenesis associated with black tea (36361). Also, when prostate cancer cells are grown in media containing serum from men who had consumed black tea, growth is reduced (36419).\n\nThe constituents of black tea have been examined in vitro. Gallic acid appears to have antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities (8123). Polyphenols in tea, such as thearubigin and related compounds, also appear to have antimutagenic effects and may protect DNA (12523, 36380). In vitro research also suggests that black tea theaflavins might have activity against liver and gastric cancer cells and leukemia cells (15657). Theaflavin seems to exert an antiproliferative effect on tumor cells by down-regulating epidermal growth factor, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (15660). Other research on cancer cells suggests that theaflavins act as aromatase inhibitors and also act as HER2/neu tyrosine kinase or Ikappa B kinase inhibitors, suggesting a role in treating and preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer as well as other cancers (15661, 36340). Theaflavins and catechins have been shown to induce apoptosis (cell death) in human leukemia cells (15662). Other mechanisms of action may include the antioxidant activity of tea polyphenols (6032) and their ability to inhibit lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-dependent activities (36371), as well as the ability of tea constituents to induce apoptosis (36602).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBlack tea theaflavins appear to modify the activity of enzymes involved in inflammation, including cyclooxygenase. In vitro, theaflavins increase the formation of prostaglandin E2 while having negative or opposite effects on other metabolites (36371, 36383).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that rinsing with a black tea extract might be useful as a mouthwash to prevent dental caries (8124). Laboratory research suggests that this may be due to the antibacterial effects of black tea and its constituents (36378, 36403, 36452, 36456, 36576).\nAntioxidant effects\nVarious constituents in black tea are known antioxidants, such as gallic acid and the theaflavins (8123, 9232). A single dose of black tea can increase the concentration of antioxidants in serum in humans (6032, 6033). However, no difference in plasma antioxidant status occurred in an animal study (102758).\nAntiviral effects\nBlack tea, due to its theaflavin content, may help prevent HIV replication. Theaflavins seem to inhibit HIV entry into host cells by targeting gp41, a viral glycoprotein that facilitates entry by fusion to the host cell membrane (15658). Black tea theaflavins may also have activity against other viruses. Some research suggests that theaflavins, particularly theaflavin digallate, can inhibit replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (15659). Tea and its constituents have also been shown to have antiviral effects against the influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, a polio virus, and coxsackie virus types (36417, 36492, 36544).\nBone effects\nFor osteoporosis, the mechanism is not known, but it is thought that isoflavonoids in black tea have weak estrogenic effects that might be beneficial for postmenopausal adults with low endogenous estrogen levels (6404).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe antioxidant theaflavins found in black tea may be beneficial for preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (9232). Black tea contains theaflavins. Consumption of a theaflavin-enriched green tea extract has been shown to produce mild reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (11308). However, drinking black tea on a regular basis does not appear to significantly reduce lipoprotein oxidation (9230, 9231). Preliminary evidence suggests that consumption of 4 cups of black tea might restore blood vessel dilation to near-normal in people with heart disease. Constituents other than caffeine are thought to be responsible for this effect. Acute or chronic consumption of black tea does not seem to inhibit platelet aggregation in people with coronary heart disease and is unlikely to be responsible for the reported beneficial effect of black tea on heart disease (8905). Earlier conflicting evidence had suggested that an inhibitory effect on platelets resulted from a higher concentration of flavonoids than is attainable with oral intake (8028, 8029).\n\nIn contrast, black tea might have a negative effect on other cardiac risk factors. There is evidence suggesting that black tea increases homocysteine levels, possibly due to the high concentration of polyphenols in tea (8035). It is unknown whether this effect decreases any of the benefits black tea may have in reducing cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe caffeine in black tea stimulates the heart and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836). Caffeine can also acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but might not have this effect in habitual users (1452, 2722).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nThe caffeine in black tea stimulates the CNS (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370). For prevention of Parkinson disease, caffeine in black tea may prevent adenosine's inhibition of dopaminergic transmission. This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism (6022).\n\nIt has been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370). Caffeine also appears to increase plasma catecholamine levels (11837).\nCognitive effects\nThe caffeine content is thought to be responsible for black tea's effects on cognitive performance (4221, 4224).\nDental effects\nDirect antibacterial effects of black tea against oral bacteria have been shown in humans after rinsing with black tea (102727).\nDiuretic effects\nCaffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine (2712). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake (10206). Caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713). Caffeine does not substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCaffeine stimulates gastric acid secretion (11837). Other constituents in tea might improve gastrointestinal transit and protect against inflammation, as shown in laboratory research (36342, 36359, 36397).\nGlycemic effects\nSome preliminary clinical evidence shows that black tea reduces fasting levels of blood glucose (92403). Caffeine, a constituent of black tea, has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21% (12374). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nHormonal effects\nHormonal effects of green tea might be beneficial for postmenopausal conditions or cancers that are affected by hormones. It is thought that isoflavonoids in black tea have weak estrogenic effects that might be beneficial for postmenopausal adults with low endogenous estrogen levels (6404). Also, tea consumption seems to raise prolactin levels in females (an indicator of estrogen activity) in a dose-dependent manner (8122). Furthermore, a population study found that consuming a higher amount of dietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan precursors found in green and black tea, have up to a 27% lower odds of developing lung cancer (13190).\nMuscular effects\nThe caffeine in black tea stimulates the muscles (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722).\nRespiratory effects\nCaffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836).\nSexual effects\nTraditionally, black tea is used to improve sexual function by delaying ejaculation. In animal research, black tea does not affect sperm concentration, testosterone levels, or progressive sperm motility, but does increase sperm total motility and sperm vitality (102758)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if consuming black walnut as part of the diet can reduce the risk for CHD.\nEpidemiological research has found that people who increase dietary consumption of nuts in general might have a lower risk of CHD and death due to coronary events. However, there is no available evidence showing that eating black walnut, specifically, reduces the risk of CHD (8478, 13299). Still, in 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 ounces of walnuts per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD. The FDA has concluded that this claim is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (102335).\nless\nWound healing.

Black walnut fruit (the \"nut\") contains high amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) (99750). Black walnut hulls contain approximately 45% tannins (19). Black walnut leaf contains approximately 10% tannins (12). Black walnut hull also contains the yellow cytotoxic pigments juglone and plumbagin (12981). Black walnut hull and leaf also contain ellagic acid (36627), sesquiterpenes (36630), magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, chromium, selenium, and even traces of arsenic (36623).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome in vitro research shows that tannins from black walnut have antibacterial activity, especially against Listeria monocytogenes (36624). The toxic constituents juglone and plumbagin have demonstrated antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity and may be responsible for any antimicrobial effects seen with black walnut (12981).\nAntineoplastic effects\nBlack walnut contains tannins. Animal data are conflicting with respect to the carcinogenicity of tannins. They may be carcinogenic or may even have anti-carcinogenic effects. Regular consumption of herbs with high tannin concentrations has been associated with an increased risk for esophageal or nasal cancers (12). Some in vitro research shows that the black walnut constituent naphthoquinone causes apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by inducing morphological changes (36613).\nIrritant effects\nAnimal research shows that black walnut extract given orally causes inflammation of the laminar tissue and skin. The inflammation may be attributed to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 upregulation (36609, 36614, 36617, 36618, 36619, 36620).\nVascular effects\nSome animal research shows that black walnut extract can decrease central venous pressure three hours after dosing (36629). The mechanism of these effects is unclear."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of blackberry are the leaf, root, and berry. Blackberry contains anthocyanidins, ellagitannins, flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol, catechins, and phenolic acids. Other constituents include ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, chlorogenic acid, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (13531, 13532, 13533). The contents of the fruit and leaves vary with maturity (13533).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBlackberry has been traditionally used to reduce inflammation and edema. Some preliminary research suggests blackberry fruit might have anti-inflammatory activity (13529). In a rat model of diabetes, a hydroethanolic extract of blackberry attenuates diabetes-induced increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein (106546).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBlackberry has been traditionally used for diabetes. Some preliminary research suggests that blackberry leaf might have hypoglycemic activity (13630). In vitro research shows that blackberry fruit methanolic extract inhibits alpha- and beta-glucosidase (100331). Other in vitro research shows that the metabolites of blackberry fruit found in the gut increase the uptake of glucose by hepatic cells (100333). However, research in animal models shows that blackberry does not significantly affect basal glucose levels (14907). Additionally, in one clinical study of overweight or obese males on a high-fat diet, consuming whole blackberries 600 grams daily for 7 days reduced total plasma insulin levels and insulin resistance, but did not affect plasma glucose levels, when compared with placebo (100332).\nAntimicrobial effects\nChewing gum containing freeze-dried blackberry fruit 50 mg in addition to xylitol 700 mg for 20 minutes 4 times in one day reduces total bacterial count in saliva by a similar amount to a gum containing xylitol alone. Decreases in specific bacteria, including Leptotrichia buccalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Veillonella parvula, are also similar with both gums. Levels of Actinomyces naeslundii and Porphyromonas gingivalis are reduced more by the combination gum than xylitol alone (111195). Effects on dental plaque and caries have not been studied.\nAntioxidant effects\nThe anthocyanidins and other polyphenols, and flavonoids in blackberry have antioxidant effects (13623, 13624, 13625, 30636, 35986, 36631, 36632, 100331, 100333, 111195). Preliminary research suggests blackberries might inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and inhibit carcinogenesis (13624). Other preliminary research suggests its free radical scavenging effects might protect against endothelial dysfunction, vascular disorders, lung inflammation, and endotoxic shock (13625, 13627, 13628). In a rat model of diabetes, a hydroethanolic extract of blackberry attenuates diabetes-induced reductions in glutathione and total antioxidant status and increases in malondialdehyde (106546).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal research shows that blackberry juice reduces anxiety-like behavior in rats. While the exact mechanism is unknown, the affinity of flavonoids and anthocyanins for gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors is thought to contribute to these effects (103237)."

When used as eye drops, blond psyllium seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOral: Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOral: Bowel obstruction, esophageal obstruction.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, blond psyllium can cause transient flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea (1376). Starting with a low dose and slowly titrating to the desired dose can often minimize gastrointestinal side effects. There is some concern that blond psyllium can cause esophageal or bowel obstruction when consumed without adequate water or in patients with swallowing disorders (604, 8080, 8081, 110760, 112998). Orally, blond psyllium seed husk powder has been linked to an esophageal obstruction from a bezoar in a 76-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease and probable dysphagia (110760). Symptoms occurred within hours of taking the psyllium and were resolved when the bezoar was removed. Additionally, blond psyllium-containing foods were linked to an intestinal obstruction in a 26-year-old male who had been consuming them for weight loss (112998). Drainage with an ileus tube successfully removed an obstruction with a thick, gel-like consistency. Tell patients to consume plenty of water when taking blond psyllium. Suggest at least 240 mL of fluid for every 3.5-5 grams of seed husk or 7 grams of seed (1376, 8080, 8081).\nless\nImmunologic\nSome patients can have an allergic response to blond psyllium. Allergy symptoms include allergic rhinitis, sneezing, conjunctivitis, urticarial rash, itching, flushing, and dyspnea. More serious symptoms include wheezing, facial and body swelling, chest congestion, chest and throat tightness, cough, diarrhea, hypotension, loss of consciousness, and anaphylactic shock. Occupational exposure or repeated ingestion of psyllium can cause sensitization, which can lead to serious allergic reactions (2328, 2329, 2330, 8079, 9246, 92193). Severe allergic reactions may occur after eating a small quantity of cereal that contains blond psyllium. At least one cereal (Heartwise, Kellogg Co.) has increased the purity of the psyllium it contains, which has decreased the incidence of allergic reactions (9244). A warning of the potential for allergic reactions is on the label of all cereals that contain psyllium (9247). Patients hypersensitive to psyllium usually have marked eosinophilia and an elevated psyllium-specific IgE antibody serum level (2328, 2329, 92193).\n\nThere is concern that individuals allergic to pollen from English plantain weed (Plantain lanceolate) might also react to psyllium husk dust; however, it appears that there is little cross-allergenicity between these plants and is probably mild and of no clinical significance (8057, 9244, 92193).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, backache has been reported with the use of psyllium (1376).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, headache has been reported with the use of psyllium (1376).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOphthalmically, blurred vision or burning haven been reported rarely in patients using eye drops containing blond psyllium mucilage (105274).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, rhinitis, increased cough, and sinusitis have been reported with the use of psyllium (1376).\nless\nOther\nBlond psyllium has a tendency to plug feeding tubes.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Oral blond psyllium is effective as a bulk laxative for reducing constipation and for softening stools.\nBlond psyllium, in doses of 7 grams to 24 grams daily in single or divided doses for up to 8 weeks, has been used for the treatment or prevention of constipation (8424, 9423, 10092, 22969, 22970, 22972, 22973, 99501). Some evidence suggests that blond psyllium alone for 7 days can relieve constipation and improve stool consistency as effectively as preparations containing blond psyllium 6.5 grams plus senna 1.5 grams daily (8424) or docusate sodium (10088). However, some preliminary evidence suggests that taking blond psyllium is less effective than prunes for increasing stool frequency in patients with constipation (22973).\n\nTaking blond psyllium-containing combination products also seems to reduce constipation. Some clinical evidence suggests that taking a combination product containing blond psyllium, aloe vera, and celandine daily for 28 days can improve stool frequency and stool softness and decrease laxative dependence when compared with placebo in people with chronic constipation (22974). Other clinical research suggests that taking a combination containing blond psyllium 17.3%, acacia fiber 67.7%, and fructose at a total daily dose of 16.8-22.4 grams daily for 8 weeks can improve symptoms of constipation in 78% of children with chronic functional constipation (22975). Additionally, a large clinical study in adults with constipation shows that taking blond psyllium husk 2 to 5 grams daily in combination with oligosaccharides and either wheat bran or D-mannitol for 4 weeks relieves hard stools when compared with maltodextrin placebo (112994).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Consuming products containing soluble fiber, such as blond psyllium, may reduce the risk of CHD when used as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\nIn 1998, the FDA authorized a health claim stating that the addition of soluble fiber, such as that from blond psyllium, to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol might reduce the risk of CHD. The daily dietary intake of psyllium husk must be 7 grams or more (93216).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral blond psyllium reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in most patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if blond psyllium is beneficial in older adults.\nBlond psyllium seed husk or seed, added to food or as a separate supplement in a dose of 3-20 grams daily, in combination with a low-fat or a high-fat diet, can reduce levels of total cholesterol by 3% to 14%, LDL cholesterol by 5% to 11%, and apolipoprotein B by 8.8% after 7 weeks or more of treatment. It also reduces the LDL to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio after 6 months of treatment (1376, 2324, 2327, 4971, 6261, 6262, 8060, 8061, 8066, 10095) (22984, 22986, 22987, 22988, 22989, 22990, 22992, 22993, 22994, 22995)(22996). There is evidence the LDL:HDL ratio can be reduced further when blond psyllium is consumed with a diet containing approximately 12% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids and 29% as total fat (8067). However, taking blond psyllium 6 grams or less daily may not be effective for lowering cholesterol (22998). Also, there is some evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol levels to a lesser degree in patients 60 years or older when compared with younger patients (2326). Blond psyllium does not significantly increase HDL levels and may actually lower HDL cholesterol levels in some patients. However, the magnitude of change in the HDL level is much less than changes in total and LDL cholesterol levels (1376, 8433, 10095). While some evidence suggests that blond psyllium reduces triglycerides (22993), other evidence shows no benefit (13102).\n\nBlond psyllium has also been used in cereal or cookies or in mixtures of soluble fibers, such as pectin, guar gum, carob gum, and/or oats, providing up to 15 grams of soluble fiber daily for up to 8 weeks (1584, 6263, 8060, 8061, 8431, 8432, 22988, 22992). In fact, blond psyllium seems to be most effective when consumed with foods at mealtime (8062). Breakfast cereal containing blond psyllium can modestly decrease total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by 5% and 9%, respectively (1584, 6263, 8060, 8061). When used in conjunction with guar gum, carob gum, or oats for 56 months, it reduces total cholesterol by 6.4% and LDL cholesterol by 10.5% (8431). Some evidence suggests that blond psyllium seed might be more effective than the seed husk for lowering cholesterol (8069) and increasing levels of HDL cholesterol (92198).\n\nBlond psyllium has also been studied in combination with cholesterol-lowering medications. In one study, patients taking a combination of simvastatin 10 mg and blond psyllium (Metamucil) daily had similar reductions in cholesterol as those taking only simvastatin 20 mg daily (13102). Also, a combination of blond psyllium with colestipol, at half the usual doses, seems to be as effective as colestipol alone (8432). Blond psyllium also seems to reduce colestipol and cholestyramine side effects such as constipation and abdominal pain (8432, 9424).\n\nIn children with hypercholesterolemia, psyllium supplementation can further decrease LDL cholesterol levels by 7% to 15% when added to the low-fat, low-cholesterol, National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 diet. However, psyllium supplementation added to the more stringent NCEP Step 2 diet may have less of an additional effect on LDL cholesterol (8073, 8074, 8075, 8076). Blond psyllium 3.2-10 grams daily in cereal for up to 12 weeks has been used in children aged 2-18 years, in combination with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Younger children aged 2-5 years used lower amounts of 3.2 grams daily while children aged 6-18 years used up to 10 grams daily (8075, 8076). However, a small study in obese school children 15-19 years old shows that taking a specific psyllium powder (Natural Psyllium Fiber, Kirkland Signature) orally 10 grams daily for 7 weeks does not reduce LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (106859).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral blond psyllium seems to be beneficial for improving glycemic control in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is unclear if blond psyllium is beneficial for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nTaking blond psyllium seed husk 10.2-22 grams daily in divided doses for 8-20 weeks reduces postprandial serum glucose, insulin levels, serum total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia (1405, 8058, 8064, 10091, 10099, 12552, 22963, 22964). Blond psyllium reduces postprandial blood glucose levels by about 14% to 20%, total cholesterol by about 9%, and LDL cholesterol by 13% (1405, 8058). A network meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows blond psyllium 3.1-13.6 grams daily for 8 to 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance when compared with no fiber or other dietary fibers and starches (112997). In a meta-analysis of 8 studies in people with type 2 diabetes, blond psyllium 3.4-15 grams daily for 8-20 weeks was associated with significant reductions in fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides; however, it did not affect body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (102828). Blond psyllium also seems to lower postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes (12553, 12554). The maximum effect of blond psyllium on glucose levels occurs when psyllium is mixed and consumed with foods (8064, 10091). Evidence is mixed over whether blond psyllium lowers postprandial glucose in people who do not have diabetes (9249, 22965, 110762).\n\nThe FDA has allowed a qualified health claim stating that psyllium husk may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence supporting this claim (102827).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral blond psyllium seems to be beneficial for the treatment of most types of diarrhea. However, it is unclear if blond psyllium is beneficial for tube feed-related diarrhea.\nTaking blond psyllium orally seems to delay gastric emptying, slow colonic transit, increase fecal viscosity, and improve fecal consistency in patients with diarrhea (5246, 8419, 8420, 8421). Clinical research shows that taking psyllium 7-18 grams daily in divided doses for up to 7 days, alone or in combination with calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate 1 gram each daily in a weight ratio of 4:1:1, seems to be as effective as loperamide in reducing the frequency and urgency associated with diarrhea (5246, 8419, 8420, 8421, 8422). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that blond psyllium 6.5 grams three times daily might also be useful in treating post-cholecystectomy diarrhea (10097). Additionally, taking blond psyllium orally seems to reduce diarrhea associated with the use of misoprostol. There is preliminary evidence that blond psyllium 3.4 grams twice daily relieves diarrhea associated with misoprostol use and prevents its reoccurrence when used throughout misoprostol therapy (8429).\n\nHowever, the research for tube feed-related diarrhea is mixed (8423, 9422, 102829). In patients receiving enteral tube feedings, psyllium does not decrease the frequency of stools (8423, 9422). Other preliminary clinical research shows that adding a specific blond psyllium product (Mucilin SF, Paradigm Pharmaceuticals Inc.), as 15.2 grams per liter of an enteral nutrition formula does not reduce the number of days of diarrhea (102829). Conversely, some research suggests blond psyllium 14 grams daily in divided doses for 7 days may decrease the number of liquid stools (8423, 9422).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Oral blond psyllium seems to be beneficial for hemorrhoid symptoms.\nTaking blond psyllium orally seems to help relieve bleeding and pain in people with hemorrhoids (8077, 22961, 22962). One clinical trial suggests that taking blond psyllium seed fiber (Vi-Siblin) 6.6 grams before each meal daily for 6 weeks can decrease bleeding and pain upon defecation when compared with placebo in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids (22961). Another clinical trial suggests that taking blond psyllium (Metamucil) 3.9 grams three times daily for 40 days can decrease bleeding when compared with a B vitamin control supplement in people with internal bleeding hemorrhoids (22962). Additionally, a preliminary clinical trial suggests that psyllium husk 3.5 grams twice daily used with micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF, Daflon) 1500 mg twice daily for 5 days, followed by 1000 mg twice daily for 3 weeks can relieve bleeding more rapidly than psyllium husk used alone or psyllium husk used with rubber band ligation in patients with non-prolapsed hemorrhoids (8077).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral blond psyllium seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms in adults and children with IBS.\nWhile some evidence shows no benefit (8425, 22981), the majority of evidence shows that blond psyllium seed husk can relieve constipation and improve abdominal pain, diarrhea, and overall well-being in patients with IBS (2316, 8426, 8427, 8428, 22976, 22977, 22978, 22979, 22980). One meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that blond psyllium can reduce the risk of persistent IBS symptoms by 22% when compared with placebo (22982). These studies have used blond psyllium 6.4-30 grams daily in divided doses for up to 4 months (2316, 8426, 8427, 22976, 22978, 22979, 22982). There is also some evidence that a combination of blond psyllium 10 grams twice daily and propantheline (Pro-Banthine) 15 mg three times daily relieves constipation, incomplete bowel evacuation, abdominal pain, constipation, and straining associated with IBS. Patients typically experience relief after four weeks of treatment (8428). However, taking blond psyllium with mebeverine does not seem to improve symptoms of IBS when compared to mebeverine taken with a high fiber diet (22983).\n\nThere is also evidence that blond psyllium may benefit children with IBS. A moderate-size clinical study in pediatric patients in India with IBS shows that taking blond psyllium husk 3-6 grams twice daily for 4 weeks leads to symptom remission in about 44% of patients compared with 10% of patients who took placebo (110763). However, it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to patients in other geographic locations.\nless\nObesity. Oral blond psyllium seems to reduce body weight in adults, and possibly adolescents, with overweight and obesity. Benefits may be more likely if the psyllium is consumed in supplemental form just before meals in divided doses of at least 10 grams daily for at least a few months.\nA meta-analysis of 22 clinical trials in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking blond psyllium 1.7-21 grams daily for 2-36 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference when compared with placebo or control diets. However, subgroup analysis shows psyllium reduces body weight and waist circumference when the psyllium dose was at least 10 grams daily, taken for at least 10 weeks, and in supplement form. However, this finding was mostly attributed to just 2 of the 22 studies included in the meta-analysis (102825). Overall, the validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity due to differences in dose and form of psyllium used, trial duration, study size, and study design.\n\nAlternatively, a meta-analysis of 6 higher quality, less heterogenous clinical trials in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking blond psyllium 7-15 grams daily just before meals for 2-12 months reduces body weight by about 2 kg and waist circumference by about 2 cm when compared with placebo (112995). Additionally, a network meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking blond psyllium reduces body weight by almost 4 kg when compared with placebo (112996).\n\nBlond psyllium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in Iranian overweight or obese adults on a low-calorie diet shows that taking 2 pieces of an herbal candy containing blond psyllium husk 3 times daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight and BMI by approximately 3 kg and 1 kg/m2, respectively, when compared with placebo. The herbal candy contained blond psyllium husk 6% in combination with Portulaca oleracea and peanut oil and was taken 30 minutes before each meal (117240). It is unclear if these effects are due to blond psyllium, the other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nAdditionally, blond psyllium has been evaluated in adolescents. A small clinical study in school children 15-19 years of age with obesity and at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor shows that taking a specific blond psyllium powder (Natural Psyllium Fiber, Kirkland Signature) 10 grams daily in the morning and before meals for 7 weeks reduces BMI and waist circumference by 2% and 0.5%, respectively, when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo (106859).\nless\nOrlistat (Xenical, Alli) side effects. Oral blond psyllium seems to be beneficial for reducing orlistat side effects.\nTaking blond psyllium 18 grams daily with each dose of orlistat for 30 days seems to relieve orlistat side effects such as flatulence, stomach rumbling (borborygmi), abdominal cramps, oily spotting, and fecal incontinence without decreasing the weight-reducing effect of orlistat (5245).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nColorectal adenoma. Oral blond psyllium does not seem to be beneficial for preventing colorectal adenoma recurrence.\nTaking blond psyllium orally 3.5 grams per day does not seem to reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. There is some evidence that it might actually increase the risk of adenoma recurrence, particularly in people with high dietary calcium intake. However, more evidence is needed to determine the relationship of psyllium and calcium to colorectal adenoma (7585).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary blond psyllium is beneficial for colorectal cancer.\nPopulation research suggests that higher dietary intake of blond psyllium is associated with reduced mortality from colorectal cancer (92197).\nless\nCrohn disease. Oral blond psyllium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Crohn disease shows that taking blond psyllium 9.9 grams daily along with Lactobacillus- and Bifidobacterium-containing probiotics 75 billion colony forming units daily for an average of 13 months can decrease disease activity and symptom scores when compared to baseline. Overall, 70% of subjects in the study showed an improvement in clinical symptoms (22968). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if blond psyllium eye drops are beneficial for dry eye.\nIn patients with dry eye, clinical research shows that use of eye drops providing blond psyllium mucilage polysaccharides 0.35 mcg/mL four times daily for 6 weeks improves subjective symptoms of dry eye by 62%, compared with a 15% improvement in those using placebo drops. There were also improvements in light sensitivity, grittiness, burning, and blurred vision, but the eye drops did not affect objective symptoms including tear film break up time, tear production, or tear osmolarity (105274).\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral blond psyllium is beneficial for GERD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific blond psyllium supplement (Mucofalk, Dr. Falk PharmaGmbH) 5 grams three times daily mixed in 150 mL of water for 10 days may help control symptoms in some patients with GERD. About 60% of patients achieved at least 7 consecutive days of no reflux after taking blond psyllium (99500). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral blond psyllium is beneficial for hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that blond psyllium 3.5 grams taken three times daily for 6 months can reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with pretreatment in overweight patients with hypertension (54260). A small clinical study shows that taking blond psyllium 15 grams with soy protein 66 grams daily for 8 weeks can help reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, in hypertensive adults (10458). In a meta-analysis of 11 trials using psyllium 3.7-15 grams daily for 1-6 months, the overall weighted mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 2 mmHg, with only 3 trials reporting a significant reduction. Only one trial reported a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (102826). This improvement in systolic blood pressure appears to only occur with a study duration of 8 weeks or longer, and the level of effect seems to be related to baseline blood pressure. It is not clear if any reduction in blood pressure achieved with psyllium would be considered clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if the studies included in this meta-analysis used blond psyllium or black psyllium supplements.\nless\nKidney failure. Although there has been interest in using oral blond psyllium to improve outcomes in kidney failure, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blond psyllium for this purpose.\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with blond psyllium is beneficial for oral mucositis prevention.\nIn patients with breast cancer who had developed oral mucositis during the previous chemotherapy cycle, a small clinical trial shows that using a mouthwash containing a mixture of blond psyllium husk 500 mg in 30 mL water with three drops of vinegar three times daily, starting during a later chemotherapy cycle and continuing for 2 weeks, modestly reduces the degree of mucositis, severity of pain, and xerostomia grade when compared with a placebo mouthwash (105273).\nless\nPostoperative bowel function. It is unclear if taking oral blond psyllium preoperatively reduces the time to the first bowel movement after surgery.\nA moderate-size clinical study in patients undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse shows that taking blond psyllium (Metamucil) 3.4 g twice daily for 7 days prior to surgery, followed by a usual postoperative bowel regimen, does not reduce the time to the first bowel movement after surgery or pain due to the first postoperative bowel movement when compared with usual care (110764).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral blond psyllium is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking blond psyllium seeds 10 grams twice daily might be as effective as mesalamine 500 mg three times daily for 12 months in preventing the relapse of ulcerative colitis (2385). However, this dose of mesalamine is much lower than what is typically used for this indication. Another small clinical trial shows that blond psyllium 3.5 grams twice daily for 4 months also appears to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in adult patients with ulcerative colitis in remission, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, loose stools, urgency, bloating, incomplete evacuation, mucus discharge, and constipation (10086). However, the authors were unable to rule out the presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) this population. A small clinical study in patients with juvenile ulcerative colitis in remission shows that blond psyllium does not appear to have an effect on fecal bile acid excretion, an indicator of disease progression (10090).\nless\nFecal incontinence. It is unclear if blond psyllium is beneficial for patients with this condition.\nA small clinical study in adults with fecal incontinence and loose stools suggests that taking blond psyllium 6 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in incontinence episodes when compared with a dietician-led low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet (110761).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of blond psyllium for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBlond psyllium has most often been used in doses of 3-24 grams daily for up to 20 weeks. Each dose should be taken with at least 8 ounces (a full glass) of water or other fluid (12, 93217, 93218). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nDietary psyllium seems to decrease the absorption of fat (14090).

Other blond psyllium products have also been studied. Vi-Siblin S granule sachets (Parke-Davis) contain 3.52 grams psyllium per 4 grams of granules, providing 88% soluble fiber (10086, 22961). One sachet of Regulan (Sat-Isabgol) is 56% blond psyllium and contains 6.4 grams rough ground powder, of which 3.6 grams is active mucilloid (8426). Fybogel sachets contain 3.5 grams of blond psyllium husk (22972).\n\nBlond psyllium has also been consumed in pasta (Cenat) (22970) or in capsules (Konsyl, Lafayette Pharmaceutical Company) (8419).",

This effect was reversed when psyllium was stopped (106858).\nless\nORAL DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, psyllium might increase, decrease, or have no effect on the absorption of oral drugs.\nPsyllium seems to have variable effects on drug absorption. To avoid changes in absorption, take psyllium 30-60 minutes after oral medications. Animal research shows that blond psyllium delays and increases the absorption of metformin and ethinyl estradiol (12421, 99433). Conversely, case reports and animal research suggest that blond psyllium might reduce absorption of lithium, digoxin, olanzapine, and carbamazepine (12, 18, 272, 93214, 106858). Finally, some pharmacokinetic studies show that psyllium does not affect the absorption of levothyroxine or warfarin (12420, 103940).\nless",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with blond psyllium.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAs blond psyllium is a source of soluble fiber, it is not absorbed into the blood.\nMetabolism\nThere is evidence that the soluble fibers in blond psyllium undergo partial fermentation by bacteria in the colon (2393, 5246, 8071).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of blond psyllium are the seed and seed husk. The blond psyllium husk and intact seed contain water-soluble fibers that form a viscous gel in the intestine (2387). The main hemicellulose carbohydrates in blond psyllium are the backbone xylose as xylan, up to approximately 74.6%, linked with arabinose up to approximately 22.6%, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. Hemicellulose is a soluble fiber (92194).\n\nMost commercial preparations contain purified seed husk. The inner seed components, the endosperm and the plant embryo, are responsible for the majority of the allergic reactions to blond psyllium. These seed components sometimes contaminate commercially produced psyllium seed husks (9245).\nAnti-cancer effects\nPsyllium, by itself, does not seem to affect the absorption of carcinogens in the gastrointestinal tract. The soluble fiber formed by psyllium does not bind to carcinogens. However, wheat bran, which provides insoluble fiber does bind carcinogens. Some evidence suggests that psyllium might improve the chemoprotective effect of wheat bran (9250). A diet that includes an equal combination of psyllium and wheat bran might decrease the risk of breast and colon cancer. In addition, psyllium might help maintain normal cell proliferation in the colon (8082, 8083).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nIn patients with diarrhea, the soluble fiber in psyllium increases the water-holding capacity and viscosity of stools, which delays gastric emptying and improves stool consistency (5246, 8420, 8421). Psyllium also prolongs gastrointestinal transit time, possibly by delaying the production of gaseous fermentation products (5246).\nAnti-lipemic effects\nBlond psyllium seems to decrease serum cholesterol levels by adsorbing dietary fats in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing systemic absorption of the fat. Cholesterol elimination in fecal bile acids also seems to be increased by blond psyllium (1376, 8065, 8070, 8072). Increasing elimination of bile acids increases their production and turnover in the liver, which lowers serum cholesterol. Blond psyllium does not bind to cholesterol or bile acids, but they probably become trapped in the mucilloid (soluble fiber) matrix and are then expelled. This mechanism also seems to inhibit cholesterol stone formation. Because bile acid sequestrants work by different mechanisms than blond psyllium, together their effects on cholesterol is additive (2387, 9425, 9426).\n\nClinical research in school children 15-19 years old with obesity shows that taking psyllium reduces small-dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, a subclass of LDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo. However, it did not significantly affect other LDL subclasses or other types of cholesterol (106859).\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) effects\nThere seems to be an inverse relationship between cholesterol and BUN levels (8068). Since blond psyllium reduces cholesterol levels, this may explain why psyllium is not useful for lowering BUN in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn patients with diabetes, blond psyllium reduces fasting blood glucose andpostprandial blood glucose levels, probably by delaying the rate of digestion and absorption of carbohydrates (1405, 8064, 112997). However, psyllium does not seem to reduce postprandial blood glucose when it is given to people without diabetes (9249).\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) effects\nIn patients with IBS, blond psyllium is thought to normalize bowel function and relieve symptoms of abdominal pain by reducing rectosigmoidal pressure (405).\nLaxative effects\nThere is some evidence that the soluble fibers in blond psyllium undergo partial fermentation by bacteria in the colon (2393, 5246, 8071), but the bulking effect of psyllium is primarily a result of intact material (10096). When psyllium seed husk is mixed with water, the mucilage has a bulk laxative effect and stimulates peristalsis, which decreases gastrointestinal transit time (8421). The polysaccharides in psyllium that form into a gel in the intestine also lubricate stool contents and provide greater ease during defecation (8421).\nLevodopa modulating effects\nIn human and animal research, blond psyllium reduces the number of levodopa blood concentration peaks resulting in more stable blood levels (92195, 92196). This is possibly due to controlled peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract (92194).\nUlcerative colitis effects\nBlond psyllium is thought to maintain remission in adult patients with ulcerative colitis since fermentation of blond psyllium in the colon yields butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid known to inhibit cytokine production and have an anti-inflammatory effect (2385).\nWeight loss effects\nSome research shows that taking blond psyllium up to 3 hours before meals can improve feelings of fullness after meals; however, other evidence suggests that blond psyllium does not reduce hunger or improve satiety (23404, 23405). It has also been suggested that a decrease in blood glucose, serum insulin and insulin resistance with blond psyllium may contribute to weight loss over time (112995)."

Use of toothpaste or mouthwash containing bloodroot has been associated with an increased risk of developing oral leukoplakia (36666, 36668). When applied to the skin, bloodroot paste causes pain, skin erosion, and a thick scab called an eschar which falls off leaving an indented scar. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients avoid bloodroot containing topical products such as \"black salve\" (53499, 95442, 95444, 95445, 95446).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally (12); avoid using.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally (4); avoid using.",

Blue cohosh has several pharmacological effects. However, most of these effects are undesirable (3383).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory research shows that blue cohosh inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase, and inflammatory cytokines in vitro. This might explain the traditional use of blue cohosh to reduce inflammation, for menopausal symptoms, and for rheumatic pain (94535).\nCardiovascular effects\nBlue cohosh constricts coronary arteries and seems to decrease the flow of oxygen to the heart (3383).\nHepatic effects\nIn vitro research shows that a partially purified alkaloidal fraction of methanolic extract of blue cohosh root strongly inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 1A2, with IC50 values ranging from 2-20 mcg/mL. However, the unpurified methanolic extract of blue cohosh root does not have any significant effect on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Further research is needed to determine if blue cohosh poses a risk for drug interactions (94536).\nHormonal effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that blue cohosh might have estrogenic effects. A blue cohosh extract seems to enhance estradiol binding to estrogen receptors and increase estradiol-induced transcription activity in estrogen-responsive cells (6180). In animal models, it also decreases luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and increases serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity, which is a measure of estrogenic activity in the liver (6180).\nLabor induction effects\nThe blue cohosh constituents caulosaponin, caulophyllosaponin, and sparteine have been shown to have labor-inducing properties (36723). Caulosaponin and caulophyllosaponin have been shown to increase the rate and degree of uterine contraction for up to 90 minutes in vitro and in vivo (36723).\nTeratogenic effects\nBlue cohosh contains several alkaloid constituents that are suspected teratogens. There is some evidence that the constituent anagyrine might cause birth defects in humans (7110). Another constituent, N-methylcytosine also seems to be teratogenic (7110). N-methylcytosine seems to act similarly to nicotine, which can increase blood pressure, stimulate the small intestine, and produce hyperglycemia the developing fetus (7110, 36724). Blue cohosh also contains taspine, which is chemically related to morphine and its congeners (7110). Taspine seems to be cytotoxic and lethal to embryos even at very low concentrations (7110)."

Blueberry, as the whole fruit, juice, or in a powder formulation, is safe when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods (13533, 92387, 92388, 92394, 96467, 97181, 99139).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of blueberry when used topically or when the leaves are used orally.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts commonly found in foods (13533, 96465).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (13533, 107281). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of blueberry for medicinal use; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, blueberry is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting with freeze-dried blueberries.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, freeze-dried blueberries may cause constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In one clinical trial, 26% of patients taking freeze-dried blueberries 50 grams daily dropped out in the first week of the study due to gastrointestinal complaints (107278).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Most clinical research suggests that consuming freeze-dried blueberries or blueberry powder does not lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension, prehypertension, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nAlthough conflicting results exist (92386, 99139), a meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials including approximately 200 patients with hypertension, prehypertension, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease shows that consuming freeze dried blueberries or blueberry powder 22-50 grams daily for 6-8 weeks does not significantly lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (92390).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Small clinical studies suggest that oral blueberry products may slightly improve some measures of cognitive function in older adults with age-related cognitive decline.\nMost clinical evidence shows that blueberry can improve some aspects of cognitive decline, but it has minimal effect on other measures. One small clinical trial in older patients with self-reported cognitive decline shows that taking freeze-dried blueberry powder 12.5 grams twice daily for 6 months modestly improves cognitive performance in daily activities but most measures of cognitive function did not improve (97181). Another small clinical study in patients 60 years of age and older with self-reported memory complaints shows that taking a wild blueberry extract (ThinkBlue, Naturex Inc) 100 mg daily with cysteine and glutathione modestly improves episodic memory at 3 months, but not at 6 months, when compared with placebo. However, taking this same blueberry extract or a wild blueberry powder 450 mg or 900 mg daily with cysteine and glutathione does not improve sequence recall, working memory, or executive function (99139). Other small clinical studies show a benefit in some, but not all measures of executive functioning and memory (96467, 111234)\nless\nAging. It is unclear if consuming blueberry can improve functional mobility in adults 60 years of age and older.\nOne small clinical study in adults over 60 years of age shows that consuming 2 cups of frozen blueberries daily for 6 weeks improves some measures of functional mobility, such as foot placement and balance, when compared with drinking carrot juice. However, blueberry does not seem to improve hand grip strength, executive function, or other measurements of gait speed when compared with carrot juice (92387). Another small clinical study in this same age group shows that consuming 12 grams of powdered blueberry mixed with liquid twice daily for 3 months does not improve measures of functional mobility when compared with placebo (96467).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral blueberry can improve symptoms of anxiety.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking 30 mL of blueberry juice diluted in 100 mL of water twice daily for 20 days reduces measures of state and trait anxiety when compared with placebo (111235).\nless\nAthletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral freeze-dried blueberry powder may not reduce exertion or improve long-distance running performance in trained runners.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with running experience show that taking freeze-dried blueberry powder 24 grams three times daily for four days does not improve perceived exertion, the time to run 8 km, or distance run over 30 minutes when compared with placebo. However, blueberry does appear to modestly attenuate increases in blood lactate after running (101963, 107282).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral blueberry for preventing cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blueberry for this purpose.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral blueberry supplementation might modestly improve body weight and triglyceride levels, but not body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, or cholesterol levels, in patients at risk for CVD.\nA meta-analysis of 11 small and low-quality clinical studies involving a total of 497 adults with various risk factors for CVD shows that taking blueberry for 4-16 weeks modestly reduces weight and triglyceride levels, but does not improve other risk factors for CVD, including BMI, glycemic indices, cholesterol levels, and certain inflammatory mediators, when compared with placebo or other control. In a sub-group analysis, weight reduction was slightly more favorable in studies of longer than 6 weeks' duration (mean reduction of 0.91 kg) and in studies using blueberry powder or freeze-dried blueberry (mean reduction of 0.86 kg) (105702). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity and small size of the included studies. Additionally, it is unclear if blueberry is beneficial for reducing the risk for CVD or CVD-related complications.\nless\nCataracts. Although there has been interest in using oral blueberry for preventing cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blueberry for this purpose.\nCognitive function. Small clinical studies suggest that oral blueberry products may improve some, but not most, measures of cognitive function in children and adults.\nSeveral small clinical studies in children 7-10 years of age show that drinking a blueberry drink containing 30 grams of freeze-dried blueberries or 200 grams of fresh blueberries as a single dose does not improve most measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo. These trials showed small improvements in some measures of cognitive function, including auditory-verbal learning, word recognition, and delayed memory, but these specific findings were not consistent across all studies (92394, 96465, 101961).\n\nAdditionally, a small clinical trial in healthy young adults shows that taking a combination of blueberry and grape extracts (Memophenol, Activ'Inside) 600 mg increases the ability to complete serial three subtraction by 2.5-fold when compared with placebo. However, there were no other improvements in working memory or attention during a sustained cognitive effort (101960).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral blueberry extract or freeze-dried powder is beneficial in patients with depression.\nOne small clinical study in adults with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)-associated depression and depression-associated gastrointestinal infection shows that taking blueberry extract 10 mg daily for 3 months reduces symptoms of depression by 49% and gastrointestinal infection rates by 84% when compared to baseline; when compared with placebo, these changes are significant (96464). Another small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking 30 mL of blueberry juice diluted in 100 mL of water twice daily for 20 days reduces symptoms of depression when compared with placebo (111235).\n\nA small clinical study in healthy adolescents 11-17 years of age without diagnosed mental health issues at baseline shows that drinking freeze-dried wild blueberry powder 13 grams daily for 4 weeks improves self-reported depressive symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms or transient affect, when compared with placebo. The adolescents enrolled in this study were found to have suboptimal fruit and vegetable intake at baseline (105703).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral freeze-dried blueberry powder is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nA small clinical study in males 45-75 years of age with type 2 diabetes shows that drinking 11 grams of freeze-dried highbush blueberry powder mixed with water twice daily with a meal for 8 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and triglyceride levels, but not body weight, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or blood pressure, when compared with placebo. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (105701).\n\nBlueberry has also been evaluated for the prevention of gestational diabetes. A small clinical study in patients with a history of gestational diabetes shows that consuming 280 grams of blueberries plus 12 grams of soluble fiber daily for 18 weeks, starting at less than 20 weeks' gestation, along with standard care reduces maternal weight gain and blood glucose levels after glucose challenge testing when compared with standard care alone. However, neither gestational diabetes incidence nor infant birth weight was lower with blueberry supplementation when compared with standard care alone (107281).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral blueberry is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nOne small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking blueberry juice 30 mL twice daily for 20 days reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (111235). Additionally, drinking a combination of blueberry, apple, chokeberry, and cranberry juice 300 mL daily for 6 weeks appears to decrease total cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline in females with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (111233). However, the validity of the study is limited by its small size, short duration, and lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to blueberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nIn contrast, other small clinical studies suggest that blueberry does not improve lipid levels (105701, 111234). A small clinical study in males 45-75 years old shows that blueberry has no effect on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, but may reduce triglycerides, when compared with placebo. However, in a sub-group of patients also taking lipid-lowering medications, blueberry reduced levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (105701). Another small clinical study in middle-aged adults with overweight shows that taking oral blueberry powder daily for 12 weeks does not impact total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo (111234). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral blueberry leaf extract is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking a single dose of a blueberry leaf extract 300 mg along with a high-fat meal reduces postprandial triglyceride levels, but not postprandial glucose or insulin levels, when compared with placebo (101959).\nless\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). It is unclear if oral blueberry juice is beneficial in children with JIA.\nA small clinical study in children with JIA shows that adding 50 mL of blueberry juice daily to treatment with etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 6 months increases the percentage of patients who achieve a 20% improvement in symptoms based on American College of Rheumatology criteria when compared with taking etanercept along with placebo juice. About 75% of patients in the blueberry juice group experienced a 20% improvement in symptoms, compared with 51% of patients in the placebo group, suggesting that for every four patients that drink blueberry juice along with etanercept therapy, one additional patient will experience a 20% or greater improvement in symptoms. Drinking blueberry juice also appears to reduce side effects caused by etanercept, including weight gain, infection, diarrhea, and anorexia (92388).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Small clinical studies in patients with metabolic syndrome, along with an analysis of studies in patients at risk for metabolic syndrome, suggest that oral freeze-dried blueberries do not improve body weight or glycemic control, but may slightly lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nA small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking freeze-dried blueberry powder 26 grams daily for 6 months improves flow-mediated dilation by 45% when compared with placebo, but does not affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, insulin resistance, or blood pressure. In a sub-group of patients not taking statins, blueberry increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 3 mg/dL; however, a lower dose of 13 grams daily had no beneficial effects (101958). Another small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming freeze-dried blueberries 25 grams twice daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by around 4% and diastolic blood pressure by around 3% when compared with placebo, but does not affect body weight, lipid levels, or glycemic control (107278). Additionally, a small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that drinking a smoothie containing freeze-dried blueberry powder 22.5 grams twice daily for 6 weeks does not improve blood pressure, body weight, glycemic control, or lipid levels when compared with placebo, although it does improve measures of endothelial function (107279).\n\nA meta-analysis evaluating the studies above, along with 9 small clinical trials in patients at risk for metabolic syndrome, shows that blueberry supplementation does not improve body weight, glycemic control, triglyceride levels, or systolic blood pressure. However, it reduces total cholesterol by around 8 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 9 mg/dL, and diastolic blood pressure by around 2 mmHg when compared with placebo (107280).\nless\nMuscle strength. Oral blueberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in young, healthy males shows that taking blueberry extract 200 mg plus phosphocreatine disodium salts 5 grams daily for 28 days improves peak torque and average power during leg extension exercises when compared to baseline, while individuals taking placebo saw no improvements in these measures (107284). It is unclear if these findings are due to blueberry, phosphocreatine, or the combination.\nless\nNight vision. Although there has been interest in using oral blueberry for improving night vision, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blueberry for this purpose.\nObesity. Oral blueberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease shows that drinking a combination of blueberry, apple, chokeberry, and cranberry juice 300 mL daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), or blood pressure but might improve total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline (111233). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the small study size, short duration, and lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to blueberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there has been interest in using oral blueberry for preventing UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blueberry for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate blueberry for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nFreeze-dried blueberry powder is most often used in doses of 22-50 grams daily for up to 16 weeks. Fresh blueberries, blueberry extracts, and blueberry leaf extracts have also been used, but standard dosing is unavailable for these formulations.

A 22-25 gram portion of freeze-dried blueberry powder is equivalent to 1 cup of fresh blueberries (92386, 96465, 96467, 97181, 99140, 101961, 105701). Two liters of blueberry juice contains the equivalent of 3 kg fresh berries (92388).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information about the presentation or treatment of overdose with blueberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, anthocyanins and phenolic acids are rapidly absorbed. After consumption of a drink containing 25 grams (1 cup) of blueberries, anthocyanin plasma levels are detectable within 15 minutes and peak after approximately 2 hours, with peak plasma levels ranging from 1-5 nmol/L. Vanillic acids reach peak concentrations of 50-70 nmol/L at 0.5-2 hours. Syringic acid reaches a peak concentration of 22 nmol/L at 2.5 hours. Hippuric acid, the most abundant phenolic acid detected in human plasma after blueberry consumption, continues to increase from 6 hours after ingestion through 24 hours, the last measured time point (96466).\n\nThe bioavailability of the constituents in blueberry appears low, although this is at least partly attributed to their rapid metabolism. Total bioavailability is 1.1% for unmetabolized anthocyanins and 0.22% for chlorogenic acid. The continually rising concentration of hippuric acid between 6-24 hours after ingestion indicates that some constituents of blueberry continue to be absorbed from the large intestine (96466).\nDistribution\nIn animal research following 4% blueberry supplementation for 4 weeks, anthocyanins were not distributed in the plasma but were detected in the liver, eye, cortex, and cerebellum (36760).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, anthocyanins and other polyphenols from blueberries undergo glucuronidation, with glucuronide conjugates demonstrating a biphasic peak at 2 hours and 8 hours after blueberry consumption. Chlorogenic acid, a constituent of blueberry, is broken down to ferulic acid, reaching peak concentration at 1.4 hours, and ferulic acid glucuronide, reaching peak concentration at 4.7 hours. Another constituent of blueberry, cyanidin agluconide, is hydrolyzed to phloroglucinaldehyde (PGA), with PGA reaching peak concentration after 30 minutes (96466).\nExcretion\nIn humans, anthocyanins are no longer detectable in plasma at 24 hours after blueberry consumption (96466). Anthocyanins from blueberry juice and their metabolites are excreted in the urine (92391, 97181, 101958).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the blueberry are the fruit and leaves. Blueberry fruit is high in fiber and vitamin C. It also contains ellagitannins, flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol, catechins, phenolic and carboxylic acids, and the polyphenolic compound resveratrol. Other constituents include beta-carotene and other carotenoids, chlorogenic acid, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (13532, 16053, 36736, 36752). Blueberries also contain anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins, which have antioxidant activity (900, 907, 908, 92385, 101962). Although there are over 25 individual anthocyanidins in blueberry fruit, the anthocyanidins in blueberry preparations do not appear to be well absorbed. The low plasma levels of blueberry anthocyanidins may also be due to their rapid metabolism upon absorption (11096, 96466).\n\nRaw blueberry fruit may contain higher concentration of some constituents compared to cooked blueberries. Heating blueberries for 18 minutes at 190°C results in a loss of 17% to 46% of resveratrol content due to degradation (16053). Fresh blueberries vary in the levels of their nutrients from locale to locale and among different seasons within a single location (30636, 36768).\nAnti-bacterial effects\nBlueberry, like its relative, the cranberry, appears to prevent bacterial adhesion to the bladder and bacterial colonization (2813, 6757). In laboratory research, blueberry extract does not inhibit the growth of common gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens, including C. difficile, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Campylobacter species, Aeromonas species, and Shigella species (96464).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that blueberry and its constituents have anti-cancer effects. Ethyl acetate extracts of blueberry fruit inhibit ornithine decarboxylase, which is a key enzyme in tumor progression (888). Blueberries promote apoptosis and reduce growth of cancer cells. Constituent pterolstibenes may play a role by altering the expression of some genes. Anthocyanins might alter the activity of enzymes that play a role in cancer development and promotion (36741, 36744, 36749, 36757).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBlueberry is traditionally used for inflammation and pain. In animal research, blueberry extracts decrease edema and pain (36750). In children with inflammatory arthritis, blueberries inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and decrease signs of inflammation (92388). In vitro, the serum from adults consuming blueberries has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity (101962).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBlueberry might be of benefit for glycemic control; however, it is unclear if this occurs in patients with diabetes. A small clinical study in sedentary adults shows that acute blueberry consumption can lower postprandial glucose, possibly due to inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Blueberry supplementation may also improve insulin sensitivity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (107283). Laboratory research suggests that fermented blueberry juice, as well as root, stem, and leaf extracts, increases glucose uptake into muscle cells independently of insulin (36743, 36759). Fermented blueberry juice, and root and stem extracts, also promote glucose uptake into adipose cells (36743, 36759). A clinical small study of overweight middle-aged adults with insulin resistance shows that taking oral blueberry powder daily for 12 weeks may reduce fasting insulin levels, suggesting that anthocyanins found in blueberries can reduce endogenous insulin demand without increasing glycemia (111234).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research from animal models suggests that blueberry extracts might reduce normal oxidative cellular damage that occurs with aging (908, 1419, 9429). In humans, plasma antioxidant status is improved by eating freeze-dried blueberries (36728, 36754); however, the juice appears to be less effective (6754). In vitro, the serum from adults consuming blueberries has demonstrated antioxidant activity (101962).\nCardioprotective effects\nThere is some interest in using blueberry to improve cardiovascular disease-related risk factors. Researchers theorize that the potential cardioprotective effects of blueberry are due to polyphenolic compounds including rutin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid and biologically active substances such as vitamin C and various minerals. Furthermore, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of phenolic compounds may combat the muscle atrophy associated with oxidative stress and inflammation caused by cardiovascular disease (111233).\nCentral nervous system effects\nIn clinical research, blueberry extract 10 mg daily for 3 months led to a 48.7% reduction in symptoms of depression. This change was associated with an increase in miR-155 levels and a subsequent increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels compared to placebo. BDNF is theorized to have a significant role in clinical depression; miR-155 is a regulator of BDNF and has been associated with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (96464).\nHypotensive effects\nIn humans, the hypotensive effects of freeze-dried blueberry powder may be associated with a reduction in arterial stiffness and increased nitric oxide levels (92386, 92392, 92393).\nLipid effects\nResearchers hypothesize that anthocyanins found in blueberries inhibit plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein, an enzyme essential to modulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (111235).\nNeurological effects\nIn human research, consuming blueberry enhanced neuronal response in the left inferior parietal lobe, as well as the left pre-central and middle frontal gyrus, during working memory conditions (99140). The possible neurological benefits of blueberry are thought to be related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In animal research, blueberries are thought to protect against ischemia- and age-related brain damage, possibly improving behavior and memory (36730, 36733, 36735, 36763). In an Alzheimer model, blueberries might protect memory-associated cell communication (36731). In a small clinical study suggesting beneficial cognitive effects with blueberry, researchers theorize that blueberry may ameliorate cognitive decline via bioactive flavonoid compounds anthocyanin and proanthocyanin, upregulation of neurotrophic factors, and enhancement of cerebral perfusion (111234)."

    "Blue-Green Algae": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "The term \"blue-green algae\" refers to several aquatic and photosynthetic prokaryotic bacterial species of the phylum Cyanobacteria (91713). The most common species of blue-green algae found in supplements are from the Arthrospira genus, and referred to as spirulina (91704, 91713). Another common species of blue-green algae is Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, which is from the Nostocaceae family (91704, 91713).",
            "Warnings": "Spirulina blue-green algae are harvested from natural lakes, or are grown in commercial ponds where growth of unwanted species is controlled (91704, 91713). However, another common species of blue-green algae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, is harvested from large lakes, especially Upper Klamath Lake (Oregon, US). Samples of this type of blue-green algae are often contaminated with other cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa, which produce toxic microcystins (91704, 91713).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when non-contaminated species of spirulina blue-green algae are used orally and appropriately (91713). The blue-green algae species Arthrospira platensis has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 19 grams daily for 2 months, or 10 grams daily for 6 months (18296, 18300, 18306, 75944, 91705, 99703, 104567, 109965). The blue-green algae species Arthrospira fusiformis has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 4 grams daily for 3 months, or 1 gram daily for 12 months (15782, 91717). Another blue-green algae species, Arthrospira maxima, has been used with apparent safety in a dose of 4.5 grams daily for up to 12 weeks (18297, 99654, 99655, 102688). ...when non-contaminated, non-toxin producing strains of blue-green algae from the Aphanizomenon flos-aquae species are used orally and appropriately. Doses up to 1.6 grams daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 6 months (14842, 18310). Some blue-green algae species can produce toxins called microcystins. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the tolerable daily intake of microcystins in adults is 0.04 mcg/kg (96549).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when contaminated blue-green algae are used orally. Blue-green algae can be contaminated with heavy metals (including mercury, cadmium, lead, or arsenic), neurotoxins, and toxic microcystin-producing cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa (9171, 75966, 91704, 91711, 96550). Microcystins are most commonly reported in the blue-green algae species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae harvested from Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon. The Oregon Department of Health has set a limit of 1 mcg of microcystin-LR equivalents per gram dry weight of blue-green algae, assuming consumption of about 2 grams/day by adults (91704, 91713). However, many samples of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae have been reported to contain higher levels than this (9171, 91704). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the tolerable daily intake of microcystins in adults is 0.04 mcg/kg (96549). When consumed orally, microcystins accumulate in the liver, binding to and inhibiting protein phosphatases, causing hepatocyte damage and possible tumor promotion (9171). Aphanizomenon flos-aquae can also produce neurotoxic compounds that may be present in supplements containing this organism (91704).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when blue-green algae products are used orally. Blue-green algae can accumulate heavy metals such as lead and mercury (91704, 91711). They can also contain toxic microcystins produced by contaminating species of cyanobacteria such a Microcystis aeruginosa (91704). Children are more sensitive to poisoning by microcystins (3536). The Oregon Department of Health has set a limit for microcystins of 1 mcg per gram dry weight of blue-green algae, but some countries have set very low exposure limits of 0.2 mcg per day and 0.8 mcg per day for infants and children, respectively (91704).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using. Some blue-green algae products, specifically those of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, have been found to contain low amounts of beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). BMAA is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and breast milk has been shown to be a potential source of BMAA exposure in infants (96550).",

After stopping the supplement, inflammatory myopathy with muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase occurred. The condition resolved with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide treatment (75936). In another case report, an 82 year-old woman developed a blistering skin condition over a 2-year period while taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis, dose unknown). She had partly hemorrhagic bullae, secreting erosions and macerations. These symptoms resolved when the supplement was stopped and the patient was treated with oral prednisone, topical silver sulfadiazine, and topical triamcinolone / neomycin (75921).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, gastrointestinal complaints are amongst the most common adverse effects associated with spirulina blue-green algae, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps (19272, 75924, 91713, 109969). Similarly, common adverse effects associated with the blue-green algae species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae are stomach upset, flatulence, diarrhea, and bloating (14842).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, three cases of mild gum bleeding and one case of mild bruising have been reported in patients taking spirulina blue-green algae (Cyactiv, Cerule LLC) 2.3 grams daily (containing approximately 1 gram of phycocanin) for 2 weeks (97202).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, significant elevations of liver function tests within 2 weeks of starting a spirulina blue-green algae supplement (species and dose unknown) have been reported in a 52-year-old man stabilized on amlodipine, simvastatin, and acarbose. A biopsy showed feathery degeneration and ballooning of hepatic cells. Cholestasis was present, and an ex-vivo lymphocyte stimulation test for spirulina blue-green algae was positive. All drugs and the spirulina blue-green algae supplement were stopped, with return of the LFTs to normal (9172).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, urticarial rashes and pruritus have occurred as part of generalized allergic reactions to blue-green algae (91706, 91711, 91712).\n\nIn one case report, a 14-year-old male experienced anaphylaxis with urticaria, lip edema, and asthma 6 hours after taking five tablets of spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis, strength unknown). He had a positive skin prick test. Oral challenge to an extract of the tablets, and IgE from his serum, reacted with the beta chain of C-phycocyanin from A. platensis (91712).\n\nIn another case report, a 17-year-old male with a history of multiple allergies developed rash, pruritus, angioedema, wheezing, and dyspnea within 10 minutes of taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 300 mg.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Oral blue-green algae seem to modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical studies in adults with various comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, ulcerative colitis) shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 1-8 grams per day for up to 13 weeks modestly reduces systolic blood pressure by about 4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo or control. Sub-group analyses suggest a slightly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and with a treatment duration greater than 8 weeks (116185). The validity of these results is limited by the heterogeneous methods used across clinical studies, including variations in dosage, duration, and the type of spirulina blue-green algae. Another small clinical study shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. maxima) 4.5 grams daily for 6 weeks decreases blood pressure in adults with hypertension, with the number of subjects fulfilling the criteria for hypertension decreasing from 45% to 14% when compared to baseline (18297).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Oral blue-green algae have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients 12- to 30-years of age with mild to severe acne vulgaris shows that taking a combination supplement containing blue-green algae and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus with a concentration of 1 X 109 colony-forming units once daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces acne severity but not total or inflammatory lesion counts when compared with placebo (116189). It is unclear if these effects are due to blue-green algae, lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, or the combination.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in allergic rhinitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 2 grams daily for 6 months, improves self-rated scores for sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and itching when compared with placebo in adults with allergic rhinitis (18300).\nless\nAntiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for insulin resistance due to antiretrovirals.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 19 grams daily for 2 months increases insulin sensitivity by about 225% when compared to baseline in patients with antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance (75944). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAnxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nArsenic poisoning. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for chronic arsenic toxicity.\nPreliminary clinical research in people living in areas of Bangladesh with high arsenic levels in drinking water shows that taking a combination of an alcoholic extract of spirulina blue-green algae 250 mg and zinc 2 mg orally twice daily for 16 weeks, in addition to use of filtered drinking water, increases urinary arsenic excretion, reduces hair arsenic levels, and improves skin manifestations of chronic arsenic toxicity when compared with placebo plus filtered water (18301).\nless\nAthletic performance. Most research suggests that oral blue-green algae are not beneficial for improving athletic performance; however, the available studies are small.\nAAlthough some research disagrees, most small or preliminary clinical trials show that taking spirulina blue-green algae does not improve athletic performance in trained or untrained adults. One study shows that, when compared with placebo, taking spirulina blue-green algae (Hawaiian Spirulina, Cyanotech Corporation) 3 grams daily for up to 8 weeks has no effect on exercise output during a 30-minute elliptical trainer workout in active males (97203). In elite rugby players, taking spirulina blue-green algae (Algae Green Value) 5.7 grams daily for 7 weeks does not improve jump or sprint performance or body composition when compared to placebo (104567). In healthy untrained males, a small study shows that taking spirulina blue green algae 6 grams daily for 7 days does not increase the time to fatigue related to arm cycling following a 30-minute submaximal exercise bout (104566). In male recreational runners, spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 2 grams three times daily for 4 weeks was not associated with any change in exercise intensity during a 2-hour treadmill jogging period. However, sprinting time to exhaustion following the 2-hour jog increased from 2.05 minutes to 2.7 minutes (18306). Also, a study of athletes and non-athletes shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (Parry Nutraceuticals) 2 grams daily for 8 weeks has a small effect on isometric muscle strength, but not muscle endurance, when compared with placebo (104568).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral blue-green algae have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking 3 mL of a specific combination of spirulina blue-green algae, peony, ashwagandha, gotu kola, bacopa, and lemon balm (Nurture and Clarity, Tree of Healing-LD) diluted in 50-60 mL of water three times daily for 4 months improves ADHD scores when compared with placebo in previously untreated children aged 6-12 years (19272). It is unclear if this effect is due to blue-green algae, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in beta-thalassemia.\nIn children with beta-thalassemia, preliminary clinical research shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (GNC Natural Brand Spirulina, General Nutrition Corporation) 250 mg/kg daily, up to a maximum dose of 4 grams daily, for 3 months reduces the percentage of children requiring blood transfusion during an interval of less than 2 weeks from 66% to 40%. There were also improvements in red blood cell count and levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and liver function enzymes (104569). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBlepharospasm. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial when used in conjunction with botulinum toxin injections.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing the blue-green algae species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Super Blue-Green Algae, Cell Tech) 1500 mg per day orally for 6 months in addition to botulinum toxin-A injections does not reduce eyelid spasms when compared with botulinum toxin-A alone in people with essential blepharospasm or Meige syndrome (14842).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are effective for improving cognitive impairment.\nA small clinical study in patients aged 60 or older with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking blue-green algae extract 1 gram 3 times daily for 12 weeks slightly improves some components of cognitive function testing related to visual learning, memory, and vocabulary when compared with placebo (112001). However, the validity of these findings is limited by lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons, which may explain the discrepant results with the other components of the cognitive function tests.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Research suggests that oral blue-green algae are not beneficial in COVID-19.\nA large clinical study in adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and at least 1 high-risk criterion (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity), most with a history of COVID-19 vaccination, shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 500 mg twice daily for 14 days does not reduce hospitalizations or emergency department visits when compared with placebo (116186).\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of seven small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 0.8-14 grams daily for 6-12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and improves total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but does not affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, when compared with placebo. There was no reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); however, all but two of the studies lasted less than 12 weeks, limiting the validity of the findings related to HbA1c (109970).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in dyslipidemia.\nSeveral clinical studies in patients with normal or elevated cholesterol levels show that doses of spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis, A. maxima, A. fusiformis) ranging from 1-10 grams daily for 1-6 months may reduce total cholesterol by 8% to 27%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 10% to 65%, and triglycerides by 0% to 23%; and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 0% to 66% (18297, 18298, 18299, 91705, 91708, 91710, 91717, 102689). However, the validity of these studies is limited by methodological weaknesses and heterogeneous population characteristics. A meta-analysis of 23 small studies, several of which were in patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity, shows that taking blue-green algae 0.8-10 grams for 4 to 24 weeks modestly improves levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol when compared with placebo or no treatment (112004). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies which enrolled patients of varying health status and employed various study designs.\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are effective for the prevention of exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small clinical study in recreationally trained males shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 2 grams three times daily does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness after eccentric exercise when compared with placebo (109967).\nless\nHepatitis C. Evidence for the use of oral blue-green algae in hepatitis C is conflicting.\nOne clinical study in adults with chronic hepatitis C who are unresponsive to interferon treatment shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 500 mg orally three times daily for 6 months is associated with greater improvements in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels than taking silymarin 140 mg three times daily. Complete virological response rates were 13% with blue-green algae and 3% with silymarin, although this difference was not statistically significant (63247). However, in another study in people with chronic hepatitis B or C, liver function enzyme levels worsened after one month of treatment with oral spirulina blue-green algae (18304).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for people with HIV/AIDS who do not have access to antiretrovirals.\nOne clinical study in adults with untreated HIV shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) powder 5-10 grams daily for 3-6 months does not affect CD4 counts, viral load, or weight gain in patients with HIV (75927, 91707). However, in one study, the incidence of opportunistic infections, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, and fatigue was 43% for patients taking spirulina blue-green algae, compared to 70% for patients taking placebo (91707).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for iron deficiency anemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nLichen planus. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in patients with oral lichen planus.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks along with application of triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% oral paste three times daily for 1 week reduces pain and lesion size when compared with only triamcinolone acetonide three times daily for 8 weeks (109963).\nless\nMalnutrition. Evidence for the use of oral blue-green algae in malnutrition is conflicting.\nSome clinical research in severely undernourished children shows that adding spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) 5 grams orally twice daily for 8 weeks to a traditional diet results in an average daily weight gain of 25 grams, compared with only 15 grams for those given the traditional diet alone. Similarly, giving blue-green algae 10 grams twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to a misola diet (millet, soy, peanut kernel, sugar, and salt) results in an average daily weight gain of 34 grams, compared with only 20 grams for children given the misola diet alone (18308). However, a small clinical study in malnourished children aged 3 months to 3 years shows that giving spirulina blue-green algae 5 grams daily for 3 months in addition to a traditional diet fails to increase weight gain more than the traditional diet alone (18309). Similarly, a moderate-size crossover study in preschool-aged children in Cambodia shows that taking blue-green algae 2 grams 5 times a week during the first hour of school for 8 weeks does not improve weight gain or height but may reduce the proportion of children with anemia when compared with placebo (112002). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the high rate of patients lost to follow-up and the lack of statistical adjustment for confounding factors, such as parasitism and home diet.\nless\nMemory. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for memory, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for improving symptoms of menopause.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking a product containing the blue-green algae species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Klamin, Nutrigea) 1.6 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces anxiety and depression when compared with placebo in menopausal adults aged 50-60 years. The treatment has no effect on vasomotor symptoms or hormone levels (18310).\nless\nMental alertness. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for reducing mental fatigue.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (Hawaiian Spirulina, Cyanotech Corporation) 3 grams daily for up to 8 weeks improves performance on a mathematical based mental fatigue test in healthy men when compared with placebo. Subjective improvement in mental alertness over placebo was also reported (97203).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (Spirulysat, AlgoSource), providing phycocyanin 20 mg, daily for 12 weeks improves triglyceride levels, but does not reduce body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, glycemic indices, or other lipid levels, when compared with placebo (109971).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for NAFLD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nObesity. Evidence for the use of blue-green algae in obesity is conflicting.\nSmall, low-quality clinical trials have shown mixed results in people with obesity (18295, 91717, 97205, 99655, 99703, 102688). When results are analyzed together, there is evidence of a very small benefit for both body weight and plasma lipid levels. Two meta-analyses show that taking spirulina blue-green algae may increase weight loss by up to 1.85 kg when compared with placebo (102690, 104565). A greater effect is seen in patients with obesity when compared with overweight patients. In addition, there is a small effect on fat loss (102690). However, there is evidence from two studies lasting longer than 12 weeks that taking blue-green algae may slightly increase BMI (104565). A meta-analysis of small clinical trials also shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae reduces fasting blood sugar and total cholesterol levels by a small amount when compared with placebo, but has no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels, in patients with obesity (102689). When combined with an exercise program, taking spirulina blue-green algae increases weight loss by 1.4 kg and improves exercise tolerance and total, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with exercise alone (99655, 102688). Doses have included a specific product containing the spirulina blue-green algae species A. fusiformis (Multinal, New Ambadi Estate Pvt. Ltd.) 1 gram twice daily or four times daily for 3 months (91717) or spirulina blue-green algae 2 grams daily for 3 months, or 4.5 grams daily for 6 weeks, alone or in combination with exercise (97205, 99655, 102688).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for oral leukoplakia in tobacco chewers.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae (A. fusiformis) orally 1 gram daily for 12 months produces regression of precancerous oral leukoplakia lesions in 45% of tobacco chewers, compared to only 7% of those receiving placebo. Regression rates appear to be highest in those with homogeneous lesions and lowest in those with ulcerated or nodular lesions (15782).\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis.\nA network meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies in adults with oral submucous fibrosis shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 500-1000 mg daily for 3-4 months does not improve mouth opening when compared with placebo (113514).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if injecting blue-green algae into periodontal pockets is beneficial in periodontitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that injecting a 4% w/v gel prepared from spirulina blue-green algae into periodontal pockets of adults with chronic periodontitis, after scaling and root planing, is associated with a decrease in probing pocket depth of 1.57 mm after 120 days, compared with only 0.84 mm in patients receiving scaling and root planing alone (91709).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nStress. Although there has been interest in using oral blue-green algae for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of blue-green algae for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral blue-green algae are beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with ulcerative colitis shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves quality of life scores and reduces stress and sleep disturbances when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on most measures of sleep quality, mood, and fatigue (109969).\nless\nWound healing.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSpirulina blue-green algae grow most prolifically in warm, alkaline water with a high salt content (20-70 grams/L) (91713, 91716). Spirulina blue-green algae are a rich source of nutrients including protein; complex carbohydrates including glucose polysaccharides; lipids; vitamins A, E, K, beta-carotene, and B-complex; and minerals including iron, manganese, zinc, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, copper, selenium, and chromium (91709, 91710, 91713). Protein accounts for 60% to 70% of the dry weight, but the protein is relatively deficient in the amino acids methionine, cysteine, and lysine. This makes it an inferior source to milk and meat, but superior to plant proteins (75951, 91716). The lipid content of spirulina blue-green algae is between 1.5% and 12%, with 70% to 80% being free fatty acids including gamma-linolenic acid (91713, 91716). Blue-green algae also contain various colored compounds, including carotenoids, chlorophyll, and phycobiliproteins including C-phycocyanin, allo-phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin (18312, 91709). Spirulina blue-green algae are reported to contain vitamin B12, but the majority is in the form of pseudo-B12 and other inactive analogs, which are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (91719).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nLaboratory research shows that spirulina blue-green algae, given for 12 weeks to obese rats on a high-fat diet, improves glucose tolerance and decreases hepatic NADPH oxidase activity but does not reduce weight gain (99702).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory activity of spirulina blue-green algae may be due to scavenging of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of histamine release from mast cells, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (91709). A component of spirulina blue-green algae called C-phycocyanin is reported to be a selective COX-2 inhibitor (75892, 91715).\nAnticoagulant and antiplatelet effects\nC-phycocyanin, isolated from spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis and A. fusiformis), inhibits platelet aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin, and arachidonic acid in vitro. Mechanisms include inhibition of thromboxane A2 and B2 production via inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and thromboxane synthase, attenuation of platelet intracellular calcium mobilization, reduced expression of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, and inhibition of free radicals released from activated platelets (18311, 18312). C-phycocyanin also promotes breakdown of fibrin clots by inducing urokinase-type plasminogen activator in vascular endothelial cells (75892). Calcium spirulan, a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis), exerts anticoagulant effects in vitro by potentiating thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II (92162). An extract from spirulina blue-green algae (A. maxima) has been reported to prevent platelet adhesion and activation, and to exert an anticoagulant effect, prolonging activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) (92163). However, an extract from spirulina blue-green algae (A. plantensis) had no effect on platelet activation as measured by P-selectin expression, apTT level, thrombin clotting time, or fibrinogen activity in adults (97202).\nAntioxidant effects\nA meta-analysis of nine clinical studies shows that spirulina blue-green algae have antioxidant effects and moderately increase superoxide dismutase activity when compared with a control. However, it does not seem to increase the activity of glutathione peroxidase (109966). Additionally, a clinical study in adults with mild-moderate ulcerative colitis suggests that blue-green algae reduce serum malondialdehyde and increase total antioxidant capacity (116188). The antioxidant effects of spirulina blue-green algae may be due to the constituent C-phycocyanin. Animal and in vitro research shows that C-phycocyanin has antioxidant activity and scavenges free radicals (9468, 9469, 75892, 75893).\nAntiviral effects\nCalcium spirulan, a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from the spirulina blue-green algae Arthrospira platensis, inhibits in vitro replication of enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human cytomegalovirus, mumps, measles, and influenza A (75955, 75958, 91715).\nCardiovascular effects\nClinical research shows that taking spirulina blue-green algae decreases markers of endothelial damage, including vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and endothelin-1. These markers are increased by sustained high blood pressure (99654).\nChelating effects\nSpirulina blue-green algae can remove chromium, cadmium, nickel, copper, lead and other metal ions from contaminated water (75896, 75905, 75911). The mechanism involves adsorption of the heavy metal to the surface of the blue-green algae, followed by transport into the cell (75896).\nErgogenic effects\nSpirulina blue-green algae are of interest for improving athletic performance. In human research, taking spirulina blue-green algae for one week has been shown to increase levels of hemoglobin and reduce oxygen uptake and heart rate during submaximal exercise. The antioxidant effects of spirulina blue-green algae may also play a role (15526, 104566).\nHematologic effects\nClinical research suggests that spirulina blue-green algae improve serum iron levels but not some other iron status biomarkers (e.g., ferritin, hemoglobin) when compared with placebo (116187).\nImmunologic effects\nSpirulina blue-green algae can increase cyclic AMP levels in mast cells and inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (9173). The spirulina blue-green algae species A. platensis has been shown to inhibit immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated histamine release from mast cells (75956, 91715). It also reduces the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) by blood mononuclear cells in people with allergic rhinitis taking 2 grams daily for 12 weeks (15527, 91715). Spirulina blue-green algae (A. platensis) might also increase the concentration of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the gastrointestinal tract, which may decrease the risk of food allergies (9434, 10267).\nLipid-lowering effects\nSuggested mechanisms for the lipid-lowering effects of spirulina blue-green algae include free radical scavenging, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and increased activity of superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase (91710). Downregulation of NADPH and NADH, which are cofactors in fat metabolism, may also be involved (91710). The compound C-phycocyanin isolated from blue-green algae inhibits jejunal cholesterol absorption, ileal bile acid reabsorption, and pancreatic lipase activity (75883, 91708).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using blue-green algae for weight loss, with some clinical studies resulting in slight reductions in body weight in obese or overweight individuals taking spirulina blue-green algae (102690, 104565). Clinical research also shows that spirulina blue-green algae might aid in body fat reduction in wrestlers that are losing weight for competitions (109968). The mechanism of action is unclear."

The main anthocyanins are cyanidin, malvidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and peonidin as glucosides or galactosides (96816, 102377). The anthocyanins have antioxidant properties (108503). Bog bilberry is also rich in vitamin C (96816).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn laboratory research, bog bilberry extract reduced the growth of cancer cell lines, possibly by altering cell cycle changes and inducing apoptosis (96816, 102377). The growth of a non-malignant cell line was also reduced, suggesting a lack of selectivity (102377). However, cancer cell lines seemed to be more susceptible to membrane damage than non-malignant cell lines (102377).\nDermatologic effects\nUV-B irradiation of skin causes photodamage, which is similar to the effects of aging. It is marked by increased skin thickening and wrinkling, reduced water capacity, increased transepidermal water loss, and increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor. In animal research, the degree of these changes is lessened in a dose-dependent manner when the animals are given an ethanol extract of bog bilberry orally 5 times weekly. Bog bilberry extract also reduces gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase and increases levels of antioxidant-related genes (108503).\nOcular effects\nThe antioxidant effects of bog bilberry on retinal cells have been shown in laboratory research.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of boldo.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of boldo is the leaf. Boldo leaves contain alkaloids and flavonoids. The main alkaloid is boldine, found in the leaves at levels of approximately 0.14%. Boldine is found in the volatile fraction of the leaf, and not in aqueous extracts. The flavonoid, catechin, is approximately 2.25% of the leaf (100301, 100303). The leaf contains 2.5% volatile oil which contains the liver toxin ascaridole (4).\nAntioxidant effects\nBoldine and catechin contribute to the antioxidant effects of boldo leaf extract. In animal and laboratory models, boldo leaf extract, as well as boldine and catechin, had antioxidant effects, including the inhibition of lipoperoxidative effects of triggers such as cisplatin. The antioxidant effects of the constituents of boldo are thought to explain some of its potential clinical effects, including chemoprotective and hepatoprotective effects (36778, 36779, 36783, 100301, 100303).\nAntiplatelet effects\nBoldine, a constituent of boldo, has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and the release of ATP-induced by arachidonic acid and collagen in rabbit platelets (36789). There's some evidence that boldine may inhibit thromboxane A2 production, resulting in antiplatelet activity (5191).\nAntiseptic effects\nThe mild urinary antiseptic properties of boldo probably result from the irritant volatile oil (4).\nBile flow effects\nThe alkaloidal constituents of boldo are thought to be responsible for the stimulation of bile and bile flow (4).\nChemoprotective effects\nIn vitro, boldo extracts and the constituent boldine have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of some, but not all, types of cancer cells (100303, 106432). In the human prostate cancer PC3 cell line, a specific product containing water-soluble extracts of boldo, goldenrod, chanca piedra, fireweed, and spiny restharrow decreased cell viability in both basal and serotonin-induced proliferative conditions, potentially through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (106432). Also, some in vitro evidence suggests that boldine decreases the metabolic activation of some chemical mutagens and induces the destruction of free radicals involved in tumor promotion (36777, 36783).\nDiuretic effects\nThe alkaloidal constituents of boldo are thought to be responsible for diuresis. The diuretic and mild urinary antiseptic properties probably result from the irritant volatile oil (4).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBoldo is used for mild gastrointestinal (GI) spasms. The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, as shown in in vitro studies, is thought to explain the effects of boldo on increased gastrointestinal motility (100303)."

This is based on limited data from two reports published in the 1980s. In one report, three patients with schizophrenia who had received phenothiazines developed EEG changes suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy after starting treatment with evening primrose, another source of GLA. However, none experienced an actual seizure (21013). In the other report, two patients with schizophrenia who were stabilized on phenothiazines developed seizures when evening primrose 4 grams daily was added. One of these patients had a prior history of seizures (21010). It is unclear whether evening primrose had any additive epileptogenic effects with the phenothiazines, but there is no evidence that taking GLA-containing supplements alone can cause seizures (88187).\nless",

However, gamma-linolenic acid, a constituent of borage oil, seems to decrease platelet aggregation by 45% and increase the risk of bleeding by 40% in animal and clinical research (1979).

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information regarding the presentation or treatment of overdose with borage.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nResearch on the absorption of borage is lacking. However, some research in healthy volunteers suggests that the time to peak plasma levels (Tmax) of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a major component of borage seed oil, after a 3-gram dose of evening primrose oil (Epogam) is 2.7-4.4 hours (49320)\nMetabolism\nIn human research, when borage seed oil is consumed, GLA is metabolized to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) (6106, 36807, 36812).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of borage are the seed oil, flowers, and leaves. Borage seed oil contains 18% to 26% gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid (8013, 105841). The leaves and flowers of borage do not contain GLA (7162).\nAnti-atopic effects\nIt has been theorized that low arachidonic acid levels in breast milk of atopic mothers might increase the risk of atopy in infants; however, maternal oral supplementation with borage seed oil does not increase concentrations of arachidonic acid in breast milk (6106).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThe GLA contained in borage seed oil might reduce the growth of tumors, possibly by inhibiting the mobility and invasiveness of cancer cells as shown in laboratory research (8013).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe GLA contained in borage seed oil reduces production of interleukin 1 (IL-1)-beta, which may be involved in inflammation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (12470). Also, GLA is rapidly metabolized to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). DGLA is a precursor to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), which has potent anti-inflammatory properties (8013, 12088, 12089). Borage seed oil, in combination with fish oil, also decreases the serum activity of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) and change the activity of other cytokines (7635). Borage seed oil can decrease the activity of tumor necrosis factor (8459, 112147).\nAntioxidant effects\nBorage flower and dried leaves contain rosmarinic acid, which might have antioxidant effects (12855).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe GLA contained in borage seed oil may have cardiovascular benefits. In laboratory and/or human research, GLA appears to lower triglycerides, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, decrease blood pressure, have antiplatelet effects, and prolong bleeding time (1979, 7634, 8470).\nEstrogenic effects\nThe GLA contained in borage seed oil might have an antiestrogenic effect. It seems to modulate the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (Taxol) and fulvestrant (Faslodex), enhancing malignant cell-killing without adverse effects on normal cells (8133, 11791). However, other research suggests that GLA alone can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells at low concentrations and inhibit growth at higher concentrations (11339).\nHepatotoxic effects\nThe borage plant contains various pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), some of which are toxic (14484). PAs are most concentrated in the plant roots, but may be found in all plant parts including the leaves, flowers, and seeds (14485). Borage products contain variable amounts of hepatotoxic PAs. The total amount is usually less than 0.001% relative to the dry weight (12842). Unlike borage seed itself, borage seed oil products contain only a very small amount of PAs, if any (14483, 14485). According to one analysis, crude borage seed oil preparations contain less than 100 parts per billion (ppb). The oil refining process further reduces PA content of the oil (14483). Another analysis did not detect any PAs in borage seed oil (14485).\n\nPAs, particularly unsaturated PAs, can cause hepatotoxicity. Cyclic diesters such as retrorsine and senecionine are the most hepatotoxic. Liver toxicity may result from PA-enhanced oxidative stress, but the exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown. Single doses of 10-20 mg PAs or chronic ingestion of amounts less than 10 mcg can cause veno-occlusive disease.\n\nPAs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Hepatotoxicity may result from biotransformation of PAs by CYP3A4 into toxic dehydroalkaloids and pyrroles, which may then serve as alkylating agents (11882). Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital seem to enhance toxicity (12841, 12860). Pyrroles are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates. Some researchers speculate that early administration of N-acetyl cysteine might reduce toxicity (11988).\n\nMetabolism is also affected by pregnane X receptor induction of CYP3A4. Genetic or drug induced variation in CYP3A4 or pregnane X receptor activity can affect the degree of PA toxicity by increasing or decreasing its metabolism (12841, 12842). Hepatotoxic PAs are also toxic to the lungs. In animals, pneumotoxicity occurs as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Hepatotoxic PAs are carcinogenic and mutagenic. There are sufficient amounts of hepatotoxic PAs in herbal products to cause toxicity (12841, 12842).\nImmunological effects\nIn human research, ingestion of borage seed oil and other GLA-containing oils seems to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines by neutrophils (36806), the proliferation of T cells (36826), and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (112147). Animal research suggests that borage seed oil might have specific effects on T cell responses depending on type (36803)."

            "Overview": "Boron is an element found in water and in foods such as nuts and vegetables, often as part of natural compounds such as calcium fructoborate. Boric acid is used as an astringent, to prevent skin infection, and as an ophthalmic irrigant (7135, 95428). Historically, both the Babylonians and Egyptians are thought to have used borax (sodium borate) either as a flux for working gold or as a mummifying and medicinal agent (36859, 36873).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Boron is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) 20 mg daily (7135). ...when used vaginally. Boric acid, the most common form of boron, has been safely used for up to six months (15443, 15444, 15445, 15446, 15458, 15449, 15451, 15453, 15454). ...when used topically. Boron, in the form of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate 3% gel, has been applied to the skin with apparent safety up to four times daily for up to 5 weeks (95660, 109557).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL of 20 mg daily. Higher doses might adversely affect the testes and male fertility (7135). Poisoning has occurred after ingestion of boron 2.12 grams daily for 3-4 weeks (17). Death has occurred after ingesting a single dose of 30 grams (36848, 36863).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Boron is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL by age is 3 mg daily at 1-3 years, 6 mg daily at 4-8 years, 11 mg daily at 9-13 years, and 17 mg daily at 14 years or older (7135). The UL for infants has not been determined (7135).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the age-based UL (7135). ...when applied topically in large quantities. Infant deaths have occurred after the use of topical boric acid powder to prevent diaper rash (36873, 36874).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Boron is safe in amounts that do not exceed the UL during pregnancy or lactation, which is 20 mg daily in those 19-50 years of age or 17 mg daily for those 14-18 years of age (7135).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL. Higher doses might impair growth and cause adverse effects in the developing fetus (7135, 102058). ...when used vaginally.

Symptoms of poisoning in adults and children may include skin erythema, desquamation, and exfoliation (17).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chronic use of 1 gram daily of boric acid or 25 grams daily of boric tartrate can cause anorexia and indigestion (7135).\n\nLarger doses can result in acute poisoning. Children who have ingested 5 grams or more of borates can have persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea leading to acute dehydration, shock, and coma. Adults who have ingested 15-20 grams of borate can exhibit nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain, hematemesis, and a blue-green discoloration of feces and vomit (17).\nless\nGenitourinary\nVaginally, boric acid can cause vulvovaginal burning and dyspareunia in males if intercourse occurs shortly after vaginal treatment (15447).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, large doses can result in acute poisoning.

Oral boron treats and prevents boron deficiency.\nTaking boron orally is effective for preventing and treating boron deficiency (7135).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nRadiation dermatitis. Topical application of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate gel to radiation sites may reduce the risk of dermatitis in patients with breast cancer who are receiving radiotherapy.\nA small clinical study in patients with breast cancer shows that applying a hydrogel containing sodium pentaborate pentahydrate 3% four times daily during radiotherapy for 5 weeks reduces the risk of moderate to severe dermatitis by 50% when compared with petroleum jelly (Vaseline). However, there is no difference in patient satisfaction (95660). Additionally, a larger clinical trial in patients with breast cancer shows that applying a sodium pentaborate pentahydrate 3% gel to radiation sites 15 minutes before each session for 25 sessions reduces the risk of dermatitis by 90%, erythema by 87%, dry desquamation by 92%, and moist desquamation by 97% when compared with a placebo gel (109557).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Boric acid applied intravaginally seems to reduce vaginal candidiasis.\nSome limited clinical research shows that applying boric acid powder intravaginally 600 mg once or twice daily for up to 3 weeks can treat candidiasis and other vaginal fungal infections, including resistant and chronic infections (15443, 15444, 15446, 15449, 15450, 15451, 15453); however, this research is limited by low study quality.\n\nFor Candida glabrata yeast infections, which are less prevalent than Candida albicans infections, some evidence shows that intravaginal boric acid capsules are effective in about 65% to 70% of azole-resistant infections; however, boric acid capsules appear to be less effective than intravaginal flucytosine (Ancobon) (15445, 15454). For Candida krusei infections, which are rare and resistant to azole antifungal treatment, boric acid capsules also appear to be effective in some cases (15448).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral boron does not seem to improve athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in male bodybuilders shows that taking boron 2.5 mg daily for 7 weeks does not increase lean body mass, muscle mass, or testosterone levels when compared with placebo (944). Furthermore, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) does not recommend boron supplementation as a nutritional ergogenic aid due to a lack of supportive evidence (101009).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral boron is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nTwo very small clinical studies in healthy older adults show that taking boron 3.25 mg daily for up to 49 days orally might improve cognitive function and fine motor skills when compared with lower amounts of boron (943).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical boron is beneficial for use in diabetic foot ulcers.\nA large clinical study in adults with diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying boron (sodium pentaborate 3%) gel twice daily for 1 month marginally reduces ulcer severity, measured by the Wagner Classification system at 25 days and 2 months, when compared with control; recurrence and infection rate were also modestly reduced at 2 months (112423). However, it is unclear whether the analysis controlled for systemic antibiotic use among the two groups, which effects the validity of these findings.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral boron is beneficial for reducing pain during menstruation.\nA small clinical study in young females with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea suggests that taking boron tetraborate 10 mg daily, starting two days before and continuing until three days after the start of menstruation for two menstrual cycles, reduces pain levels by 24% and pain duration by 1.5 hours, or 34%. Both pain and pain duration were decreased by only 9% in patients receiving placebo (95428).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if boron is beneficial for medical expulsive therapy after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.\nA large clinical study in adults undergoing extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for kidney stones conducted in Iran shows that taking boron 10 mg twice daily for 2 weeks does not statistically improve the rate of stone expulsion when compared with tamsulosin; however, boron may have fewer side effects (i.e., orthostatic hypotension, headache, nausea, erectile dysfunction) (112414).\nless\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if oral boron is beneficial in patients receiving a kidney transplant.\nObservational research in kidney transplant recipients has found that higher boron intake, as measured by urinary boron levels, is associated with a lower risk of mortality when compared with lower intake. Patients with 24-hour urinary boron levels in the top tertile had a 49% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared with those in the lowest tertile; however, there was no association with graft failure (109556). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to boron supplements.\nless\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral boron for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of boron for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral boron is beneficial for osteoarthritis symptoms.\nSmall low quality studies in patients with osteoarthritis suggest that taking boron tetraborate 3-6 mg daily for up to 8 weeks might improve pain and other symptoms when compared with a lower intake of boron (941, 36870).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral boron is beneficial for osteoporosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking boron 3 mg daily does not improve bone density when compared with placebo (36872).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Small clinical studies suggest that adding topical boric acid to scaling and root planing treatment may be beneficial in periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical studies in 117 patients with periodontitis shows that using boric acid 0.75% gel or solution in addition to scaling and root planing seems to slightly improve probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) when compared with placebo or saline control (105690). Another small clinical study in patients with periodontitis shows that using boric acid 0.5% for irrigation in addition to scaling and root planing seems to improve CAL and PPD to a similar degree as using povidone-iodine 0.1% (105691). The available research was conducted in Turkey, Vietnam, and India; it is unknown if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nTooth extraction. It is unclear if boron is beneficial for use in periodontal healing after impacted third molar surgery.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults 18 to 40 years old shows that using boron 0.1% to 2.5% and chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash for 7 days after impacted third molar surgery marginally improves swelling and self-reported pain on day 7, and the higher boron concentrations also improve pain at day 4 when compared with chlorhexidine alone, but does not improve the number of analgesics used or periodontal scores (112379). However, the validity of these results is limited by a lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to show differences between treatment groups in error (i.e., false positive findings). Additionally, the study period coincides with the expected recovery time (i.e., 2-7 days), making it unclear if any effects are due to the intervention or control.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate boron for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: Although boron has been shown to have various biochemical effects in the body, an essential role for boron in humans has not yet been identified. Thus, there is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) for boron (7135). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the average daily intake of boron for adults is about 1-1.5 mg (106001).\nTopical:\nBoron has been used in various topical formulations, including as a sodium pentaborate pentahydrate gel and a boric acid gel or solution. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nVaginal:Boric acid powder has most often been used in doses of 600 mg once or twice daily for up to 3 weeks.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBoron used in clinical trials has included sodium tetraborate.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nLarge doses of boron can cause toxicity. In children who have ingested 5 grams or more of borates, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms lead to acute dehydration, shock, and coma. Severe gastrointestinal symptoms also occur in adults who have ingested 15-20 grams of borate (17). Other poisoning symptoms in both adults and children may include skin erythema, desquamation, exfoliation, and neurological symptoms (17). Death has occurred after the ingestion of 30 grams of boric acid in a single dose (36863).\n\nThere are also case reports of infants who died after exposure to boron. Historically, a honey and borax solution was used to clean infant pacifiers, and topical boric acid powder was used to prevent diaper rash. However, these practices were associated with several infant deaths due to boron toxicity (36873, 36874).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with boron.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBoron is well-absorbed when consumed in dietary beverages including prune juice, grape juice, wine, coffee, milk, and, in some geographical locations, water. Boron is also absorbed from avocados, peanuts, pecans, apples, dried beans, and potatoes (7135). Intravaginally, boric acid has minimal systemic absorption. Serum levels are typically undetectable (15444, 15446).\nDistribution\nBoron distributes to all tissues with highest concentration in bone and lowest in adipose tissue. Boron levels generally achieve steady state in three to four days (36864).\nMetabolism\nBoric acid and borates are not well metabolized by humans as greater than 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged (36854).\nExcretion\nWhen taken orally, boron is excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of 21 hours (7135, 36854). More than 50% of the oral dose is reported to be eliminated during the first 24 hours in healthy volunteers (36854). The half-life of boron is between 13-23 hours (7135, 36847, 36854).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBoron is a trace mineral for which a clear biological function in humans has not been established. Boric acid is the most common form of boron. In the diet, boron is commonly found in nuts, beans, prune juice, grape juice, wine, coffee, and milk. In some geographic regions boron is found in water (7135).\nAntifungal effects\nBoric acid is used for vulvovaginitis due to its activity against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (15444, 15445, 15446).\nAntioxidant effects\nBoron is used for prevention of radiation dermatitis due to its potential to reduce oxidative damage by increasing cellular glutathione and non-reactive oxygen (95660).\nBone mineral effects\nBoron seems to be important in mineral metabolism (943). Boron may also increase calcium absorption and decrease urinary loss of calcium and magnesium (940, 942, 9623, 36862). Boron supplementation decreases levels of serum phosphorus (940, 942). An impact on vitamin D metabolism as shown in animal research may pay a role in the effects of boron on these minerals (36858).\nCognitive effects\nBoron may improve cognition; however the mechanism is unclear (943).\nHormonal effects\nDiets low in boron seem to decrease serum 17beta-estradiol levels in postmenopausal adults (106001). Also, a small exploratory study in postmenopausal adults shows that increasing boron intake to 3 mg daily seems to increase serum 17beta-estradiol levels. However, these patients were previously consuming a low-boron diet (0.25 mg daily), which may have caused an initial reduction in 17beta-estradiol levels (9623).\nMetabolic effects\nSome preliminary research shows that increasing the amount of boron in the daily diet by 10 mg or more for one month decreases fasting plasma glucose by 4 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 16 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 13 mg/dL, body weight by 0.8 kg, and body mass index (BMI) by 0.37 kg/m2 when compared to baseline in healthy females (102057). A lack of placebo control limits the validity of these findings, and whether these effects will also be seen in patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and/or obesity is unclear. The mechanism of boron's purported metabolic effects is unknown.\nNeurological effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that boron may have a role in hand-eye coordination, attention span, and short-term memory; however, the mechanism of these effects is unclear (7135).\nReproductive effects\nThere is some evidence that boron might have a role in reproduction and development (945, 7135). However, there is concern that boric acid has teratogenic effects and can result in birth defects when used intravaginally during pregnancy (15443, 15645, 15646). Boric acid is thought to be an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, which results in histone hyperacetylation. In specific tissues, histone hyperacetylation is associated with skeletal malformations (15644).\nWeight loss effects\nSeveral animal studies suggest that boron supplementation can cause weight loss. While the mechanism of this effect is unclear, researchers suggest that boron has anti-adipogenic effects in adipocytes and plays a role in glycolysis and lipolysis pathways in the liver and adipose tissue (109558)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Oral Boswellia serrata extracts, taken alone or in combination with other ingredients, appear to reduce pain and stiffness and improve function in knee osteoarthritis. However, most clinical studies have been small and of relatively short duration.\nA meta-analysis of 11 moderate- to lower-quality clinical studies in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking an herbal formulation containing Boswellia (15-600 mg daily) or a Boswellia extract exclusively (100-1000 mg daily) for 1 to 8 months does not improve subjective scores evaluating pain, stiffness, and physical function when compared with a control such as glucosamine sulfate or valdecoxib. However, sub-group analyses show improvement in pain, stiffness, and functionality with an herbal formulation containing Boswellia compared with placebo, although the clinical significance is unclear (115731). The validity of these results are limited due to the lack of data on the herbal formulations. A similar meta-analysis including 7 of the same clinical studies plus 2 other, higher quality clinical studies shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract reduces pain and stiffness and improves function when compared with placebo (114684). Furthermore, individual trials, some included in the meta-analyses above, have shown similar results with specific Boswellia serrata supplements or extracts including 5-Loxin, Aflapin, Boswellin, Wokvel, and Boswellin Super (109564, 100699, 12432, 103784, 115735, 116901).\n\nSeveral studies also show that taking specific combination products containing Boswellia serrata and other ingredients can improve pain and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis. These products have used Boswellia serrata in doses of 100-1000 mg or boswellic acid 7.2 mg (from Boswellia serrata) 1-3 times daily for 2-9 months in combination with ashwagandha, turmeric, and zinc complex (Articulin-F) (19276); ginger, Tinospora cordifolia, and Indian gooseberry (89557); methylsulfonylmethane and vitamin C (96446); celery seed extract (as RestorCel, Phytoveda Pvt. Ltd) (116906); and curcumin, devil's claw tuber, celery seed, and ginger rhizome (as Tregocel, Max Biocare) (106078). In one study, a specific Boswellia serrata extract (BosPure, Arjuna Natural Extracts Ltd) 300 mg was taken with a specific turmeric extract (BCM 95, Arjuna Natural Extracts Ltd) (89719). However, research in patients with osteoarthritis of the hand suggests that taking Boswellia serrata extract 250 mg, in combination with pine bark extract methylsulfonylmethane, and curcumin daily for 12 weeks does not improve pain or functionality (109563).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there is interest in using oral Boswellia serrata for hay fever, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Boswellia serrata for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata improves cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking a specific Boswellia serrata extract (K-Vie, Kondor Pharma) 1200 mg daily for 6 months improves neuropsychiatric symptoms, dementia severity, and some but not all measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo (112807).\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking a specific combination product (Opera, Gamfarma Srl) containing Boswellia serrata 40 mg, alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 200 mg, and bromelain 20 mg once daily for 6 months reduces arthralgia intensity when compared to baseline, with around 22% of patients having complete symptom resolution at the end of the study (109570). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata can improve symptoms of asthma.\nOne small preliminary clinical study in patients with asthma suggests that taking a specific Boswellia serrata gum resin (S-compound, Rahul Pharma) 300 mg three times daily for 6 weeks may improve symptoms of asthma, such as forced expiratory volume (FEV), the number of asthma attacks, and dyspnea and rhonchi, in 70% of patients, compared to only 27% of patients in a control group (1708).\nless\nBack pain. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with chronic low back pain shows that taking a combination of Boswellia serrata and turmeric extracts 300 mg daily for 3 months modestly reduces patient-reported pain intensity and improves function when compared with placebo (116902). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with moderate low back pain related to posture shows that taking a specific product containing Boswellia serrata and turmeric extracts in sesame seed oil (Rhuleave-K, Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd) 500 mg daily for 15 days also modestly reduces patient-reported pain and improves daily functioning when compared with placebo (116903). Generalizability is limited due to inclusion of posture-related back pain only. Also, it is unclear from these studies if these effects are due to Boswellia serrata, turmeric extract, or the combination.\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata improves outcomes in patients with brain tumors.\nOne small clinical study in adults with brain tumors undergoing radiation therapy shows that taking an H15 Boswellia serrata extract 4200 mg in three divided doses daily throughout radiotherapy reduces cerebral edema and tumor volume, but not dexamethasone dosage, when compared with placebo (21149).\nless\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Rectal Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTwo small, open-label clinical studies in males with prostatitis-like symptoms or CP/CPPS types IIIa or IIIb shows that rectal administration of a specific suppository containing Boswellia serrata resin extract and propolis polyphenols (MICTALASE) once daily for 20 days or once daily for 15 days per month for 3 months improves pain, urinary symptoms, quality of life, and total symptom scores, as measured by the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI), when compared to baseline. However, there were no improvements in scores on the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIED), and studies showed mixed findings regarding improvements on the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) (102091, 109566). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCluster headache. Although there is interest in using oral Boswellia serrata for cluster headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Boswellia serrata for this condition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 infection in Egypt shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract 300 mg and licorice extract 300 mg twice daily for 14 days, along with conventional therapy, reduces the risk of death, shortens the time to hospital discharge by around 5.5 days, and reduces the rate of mechanical ventilation when compared with placebo. For every five patients treated with this combination product, one additional patient survived. The standard treatments administered in this study included azithromycin, vitamin C, and zinc (108579).\n\nAnother large clinical study in adults hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 infection in India shows that taking a specific product containing Boswellia serrata, ashwagandha, ginger, and turmeric (Artovid-20, Bioved Pharmaceuticals, Inc) 1,776 mg twice daily after meals for 14 days, starting within 48-96 hours of symptom onset along with conventional therapy, decreases the duration of illness by about 1 day and reduces patient-assessed severity scores of various symptoms (e.g. nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, taste and smell disorders) when compared with placebo. Almost all patients in this study also received steroids, and over 50% received remdesivir. Study results were similar in the subgroup of patients who received remdesivir (109899). However, the validity of this study is limited by use of data only from patients who fully adhered to the study protocol per protocol analysis and exclusion of patients with risks for progression to severe COVID-19, including uncontrolled hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, obesity, or immunocompromise.\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata reduces relapse rates in patients with Crohn disease.\nOne small clinical study in patients with Crohn disease who are in remission shows that taking Boswellia serrata (Boswelan, Pharmasan) 800 mg orally three times daily for one year does not decrease relapse rates or improve quality of life when compared with placebo (17241).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata improves glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of five moderate- to low-quality studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking Boswellia gum resin 500 -900 mg daily or Boswellia powder 1200 mg daily for 6-12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) but not fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo or no treatment. Additionally, triglycerides were reduced, but other lipid parameters were not improved (115732). A smaller meta-analysis pooling the results of two trials included in the previously described meta-analysis shows that Boswellia serrata reduces HbA1c by about 0.5% and fasting blood glucose by about 24 mg/dL, with no improvement in lipid levels, when compared with placebo (111503). Overall, the validity of these findings is limited by heterogeneous methods between clinical trials, such as treatment dose and duration, and the lack of data regarding other medications used for diabetes.\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata is beneficial in patients with acute diarrhea.\nA small clinical study in adults with acute diarrhea shows that taking a specific lecithin-based delivery form of Boswellia serrata extract (Casperome, Indena S.p.A.) 250 mg twice daily for 5 days decreases the time to diarrhea resolution by nearly 1.4 days, reduces stool frequency, and improves symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea when compared with placebo (109568).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with moderately painful dysmenorrhea shows that taking a single dose of a combination product containing Boswellia serrata, turmeric, and sesame (Rhuleave-K, Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg at the start of menstruation relieves menstrual cramp pain and reduces pain intensity for up to 6 hours when compared with placebo (112806). It is unclear if these effects are due to Boswellia serrata, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small clinical study in India in healthy, physically active, adult males shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract 60 mg daily for 10 days modestly reduces patient-reported muscle soreness and stiffness at day 10 when compared with placebo. Boswellia serrata was initiated 6 days prior to a downhill running protocol (116905). Generalizability is limited and results may not apply to other populations or other types of exercise. Oral Boswellia serrata has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical studies in healthy active adults with moderate to severe exercise-induced muscle pain show that taking a single, 1000-mg dose of Boswellia serrata and turmeric extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) improves patient-reported pain when compared with placebo with one study demonstrating maximal benefits within about 3 hours (109277, 116904). The number of people needed to treat to obtain pain relief of at least 50% over a 6-hour period was 1.1 (109277).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small clinical studies suggest that an oral Boswellia serrata extract may improve symptoms of IBS.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild IBS shows that taking a specific lecithin-based delivery form of Boswellia serrata extract (Casperome, Indena S.p.A.) 250 mg daily for 6 months reduces abdominal pain, cramps, and gas when compared with standard management with hyoscine butylbromide or papaverine hydrochloride plus belladonna extract 10 mg. Patients receiving Casperome required fewer rescue medications and had a 46% lower risk of needing additional medical care, including hospitalization (100713). In a short-term clinical trial of the same Boswellia serrata extract 250 mg daily for 4 weeks, the risk for requiring additional medical care was reduced by 67% when compared with the same standard treatment options above. While IBS symptoms improved over baseline, significant differences between Casperome and standard treatment options were lacking (102089). These studies were funded by the supplement manufacturer, which may limit the reliability of these findings.\nless\nKnee pain. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata is beneficial for knee pain.\nA small clinical study in otherwise healthy adults with knee pain shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract 12.5% tablets twice daily for 8 weeks improves physical function and pain but not stiffness, functional mobility, muscle function, or level of physical activity when compared to baseline (112808).\nless\nMenorrhagia. It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata is beneficial for menorrhagia.\nA small clinical study in otherwise healthy adults with menorrhagia shows that taking Boswellia serrata oleoresin powder 300 mg three times daily for 7 days, repeated over 2 menstrual cycles, improves quality of life and modestly reduces the average duration of menstrual bleeding after the second cycle when compared with placebo. All patients were permitted to use ibuprofen 200 mg as needed (105401).\nless\nMicroscopic colitis. There is limited evidence on the oral use of Boswellia serrata in patients with collagenous colitis.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract 400 mg three times daily for 6 weeks increases the clinical remission rate by 64% when compared with placebo in patients diagnosed with a type of microscopic colitis called collagenous colitis. Clinical remission was defined as having an average of three or fewer soft or solid stools daily during the last week of the study (21152).\nless\nPain (acute). Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with acute musculoskeletal pain shows that taking a specific combination product containing Boswellia serrata and turmeric extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg daily for 7 days is as effective as acetaminophen 1000 mg daily for pain relief, onset of pain relief, and onset of maximal pain relief (109287). This study is limited by its lack of blinding and placebo control. Additionally, the dose of acetaminophen used in this study is below the standard recommended daily dose.\nless\nPharyngitis. Although there is interest in using oral Boswellia serrata for pharyngitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Boswellia serrata for this condition.\nPostoperative pain. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults undergoing hernioplasty shows that taking a specific combination product (Siben®, Agaton Srl) containing 200 mg each of Boswellia serrata and bromelain twice daily for 11 days after surgery reduces pain on postoperative days 7 and 21, but not day 1, when compared with placebo. While the difference in pain scores on day 21 was statistically significant, pain was rated as mild in both groups; any difference may not be considered clinically significant (114687).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical trial in patients with RA shows that taking two capsules of a specific product containing Boswellia serrata 100 mg, ashwagandha 450 mg, turmeric 50 mg, and zinc complex 50 mg (Articulin-F) three times daily for 3 months improves pain, morning stiffness, grip strength, and disability scores when compared with placebo (21154). However, another clinical trial in patients with RA shows that taking two tablets of a standardized extract formulation (RA-1) containing Boswellia serrata, ashwagandha, ginger, and turmeric three times daily for 16 weeks does not improve most symptoms when compared with placebo (21155).It is unclear if these findings are due to Boswellia serrata, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients over 12 years of age with chronic sinusitis shows that taking a combination product containing Boswellia serrata, black currant, bromelain, and vitamin D (Flogostop Forte, Humana Italia) with inhaled corticosteroids daily for 30 days reduces rhinorrhea, hyperemia of mucosa, and local inflammation when compared with inhaled corticosteroids alone (111501). It is unclear if these findings are due to Boswellia serrata, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral boswellic acids improve neurological function after stroke.\nOne small clinical study in adults with recent ischemic stroke who are taking aspirin and clopidogrel shows that taking boswellic acids 800 mg three times daily for 30 days improves neurological function, as measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, when compared with placebo (102092).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral Boswellia serrata is effective for reducing disability, or improving cognitive function or memory in adults recovering from TBIs.\nA small clinical crossover study in adults admitted to the hospital for diffuse axonal injury shows that taking powdered Boswellia serrata oleogum resin 360 mg three times daily for 6 weeks does not improve disability when compared with placebo (91379). However, another small clinical study in patients suffering from a TBI 3 months to 3 years earlier shows that taking a specific Boswellia serrata extract (K-Vie, Kondor Pharma) 400 mg three times daily for 3 months improves performance on cognitive function tests, including those assessing processing speed, memory, and overall cognitive function, when compared with placebo (109567). A moderate-size clinical study in adults with memory dysfunction due to a recent mild traumatic brain injury in Iran shows that taking a specific product containing Boswellia serrata 360 mg and ginger 36 mg (Memoral, Goldarou) three times daily for 1 month modestly improves practitioner-assessed memory function scores when compared with placebo (110132). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to Boswellia serrata, ginger, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral Boswellia serrata extracts may improve symptoms of ulcerative colitis.\nTwo very small clinical trials in patients with active ulcerative colitis suggest that taking Boswellia serrata gum resin 300-350 mg three times daily for 6 weeks improves symptoms and disease markers comparably to taking sulfasalazine 1 gram three times daily (1709, 12438). These findings are limited because the sample size may have been inadequate to assess differences between groups.\n\nIn patients with ulcerative colitis in remission, one observational study has found that taking a specific lecithin-based delivery form of Boswellia serrata extract (Casperome, Indena S.p.A.) 250 mg daily for 4 weeks is associated with a reduction in abdominal pain, cramps, and malaise, a decrease in the need for additional medications, and a 58% lower risk for requiring additional medical care when compared with no treatment. Additionally, weekly episodes of bloody diarrhea, bowel movements, and watery stools were reduced when compared with baseline (102090).\nless\nUrinary incontinence. Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with urinary incontinence shows that taking a 3 tablets of a multi-ingredient herbal product containing Boswellia serrata 100 mg and five other herbs twice daily for 4 weeks reduces urinary incontinence frequency and leakage amount when compared with placebo, with improvements similar to those reported with solifenacin as standard therapy (111502). It is unclear if these effects are due to Boswellia serrata, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral Boswellia serrata has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational study in patients with an uncomplicated UTI has found that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Acidif plus) containing Boswellia serrata gummy dry extract 100 mg, L-methionine 400 mg, and hibiscus 100 mg daily for 7 days is associated with reduced UTI symptoms and reduced bacteriuria when compared with taking an unreported dose of fosfomycin for 2 days (103783). The validity of this study is limited by its observational nature and a lack of information on the severity of UTI at baseline. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to Boswellia serrata, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Boswellia serrata for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, ingesting a dry extract from Boswellia serrata gum resin (BSE-018) resulted in poor bioavailability of boswellic acids; however, intake with a high-fat meal seems to improve the absorption and bioavailability (36896). Following the ingestion of a Boswellia serrata gum resin extract (H15) 4200 mg, boswellic acids reach a peak after 1-2 hours, and plateau at 2 hours. Additionally, a solid lipid particle formulation (Wokvida) of a specific Boswellia serrata extract, as well as a self-emulsifying hybrid-hydrogel and micellar formulation (Boswellia-Loges) of Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract, have enhanced bioavailability (109562, 115734, 115736). Peak plasma levels were reported at approximately 2-6 hours and 1.5-4 hours for 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (KBA) and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), respectively, following single-dose administration (109562, 12441, 115734, 115736). Steady state levels of alpha-boswellic acid, beta-boswellic acid, AKBA, and KBA ranged broadly from 6.5 ng/mL to 11949 ng/mL. AKBA and KBA, which each contain a keto group, are generally present in much lower levels in the plasma (21149, 36905, 36928).\nDistribution\nA specific Boswellia serrata extract (Wok Vel) 333 mg was shown to have an apparent volume of distribution of about 143 liters (12441).\nMetabolism\nAccording to laboratory research, oxidation to hydroxylated metabolites is the principal metabolic route for some boswellic acids, such as KBA (36917).\nExcretion\nA specific Boswellia serrata extract (Wokvel) 333 mg has an elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours and a plasma clearance of about 296 mL/min (12441). Another specific Boswellia serrata extract (Wokvida) 333 mg has an elimination half-life of around 2.5 and 6.8 hours for the constituents KBA and AKBA, respectively (109562). Furthermore, similar results are observed with the specific micellar and hybrid-hydrogel formulations of Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (115734, 115736).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Boswellia serrata is most commonly the gum resin. The bark, leaf, and other plant parts are also sometimes used in preparations. The gum resin is obtained by pulling away the bark of the boswellia tree. The principle constituents of boswellia are boswellic acid and alpha- and beta-boswellic acid (1706, 17947). Commonly, Boswellia serrata is standardized to the 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) constituent (17947). The gum resin also contains up to 16% essential oils including alpha-thujene and p-cymene (17951). Various phenyl propanoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and other phenolic compounds have all been reported in the resin (91378).\nAnti-Alzheimer effects\nA clinical study in adults with Alzheimer disease shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract might reduce plasma levels of amyloid-beta (AB) 40, which is a biomarker of Alzheimer disease severity and is correlated with a poor prognosis when elevated. However, no difference was noted in levels of AB42 when compared with placebo. Boswellia serrata also seems to increase the ratio of AB42/AB40, which when reduced is an indicator of cerebral amyloid burden and increased Alzheimer disease risk. Additionally, Boswellia serrata may increase plasma transthyretin levels, which is thought to exert neuroprotective activity by binding to and clearing amyloid-beta from the brain (112807).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nBoswellia serrata is commonly used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. In preliminary research, some Boswellia serrata extracts show anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-arthritic effects (12432). Boswellic acids, especially AKBA, inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and reduce leukotriene synthesis and inhibit leukocyte elastase, which are the likely mechanisms for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties (36900, 36902, 36938, 36940). Boswellic acids also might have disease modifying effect, decreasing glycosaminoglycan degradation and cartilage damage. Boswellic acids may also reduce levels of other enzymes involved in conditions such as arthritis, including glutamic pyruvic transaminase, glycohydrolase, and beta-glucuronidase (36933, 36934, 36935). However, not all boswellia-containing products seem to have these effects (12432).\nAnti-asthma effects\nPreliminary research suggests boswellic acids stabilize mast cells, which suggests usefulness for asthma (12439).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research suggests that taking Boswellia serrata extract might reduce plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-1-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 (112807, 116901, 116905). Researchers theorize that cytokines stimulate astrocytes and microglia, leading to increased production and aggregation of amyloid-beta oligomers and neuronal death (112807).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research has yielded conflicting findings regarding the antitumor potential of Boswellia serrata. Some in vitro and animal research suggest that boswellic acids, including 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), have an antiproliferative and apoptotic effect on cancer cells (12435, 36885, 36901, 36908). A small clinical study which compared core biopsies to excisional biopsies in patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer shows that taking Boswellia serrata extract for an average of 11 days leading up to surgery appears to inhibit cancer cell proliferation but does not affect apoptosis (114685). Clinical research in patients with brain cancer shows that taking Boswellia serrata reduces cerebral edema (21149). However, in vitro research in pediatric high-grade glioma cells shows that alpha- and beta-boswellic acids promote cancer cell growth and have no effect on apoptosis. Additionally, AKBA reduces cancer cell viability but does not induce apoptosis. In ovo research shows that AKBA does not inhibit tumor growth (114686).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nBoswellia serrata might inhibit mediators of autoimmune disorders such as leukotrienes. It seems to reduce production of antibodies and cell-mediated immunity (12432, 12435, 12437, 12438). However, other research suggests that low concentrations of boswellic acids coupled with a second stimulus within specific signaling pathways might have immunostimulant effects. In vitro research in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggest that, in the presence of calcium ions, boswellic acids containing a keto group might increase reactive oxygen species and increase the release and metabolism of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (21180).\nOrgan beneficial effects\nPreliminary research suggests that boswellic acids might prevent organ rejection and ischemia/reperfusion injury (12440)."

Some preliminary clinical research in patients with osteoarthritis shows that intramuscular administration of a specific bovine cartilage-bone marrow complex (Rumalon, Robapharm) 2 mL three times weekly for 8 weeks, repeated 3 times each year for the first year and 2-3 times each year thereafter for up to 3 years, improves pain and mobility in some patients (92772, 92773).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of bovine cartilage.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBovine cartilage is composed of glycoproteins and polysaccharides (2009). Some of these proteins may bind hyaluronan (36965). One such complex called metastatin has been isolated from bovine nasal cartilage (36959, 36971). Polymeric N-acetyl glucosamine has also been identified in bovine cartilage (2009, 2010, 92770). Proteoglycan has been isolated from bovine articular cartilage (36970). Fetal bovine cartilage appears to contain a growth factor that is similar to somatomedin. It also appears to contain a glycoprotein that may be responsible for activity against angiogenesis and the growth of vascular endothelial cells (36972, 36963).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome clinical research suggests that bovine cartilage has anti-inflammatory properties (2009).\nAntiangiogenic effects\nSome animal research shows that metastatin, an isolate of bovine nasal cartilage, reduces the length and area of vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane of chickens' eggs after use of human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor for production of angiogenesis. In addition, in the wound migration assay, metastatin seems to inhibit growth and migration of endothelial cells in cellular growth and wound migration assays (36959). Fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage contains a glycoprotein that might inhibit the development of capillaries in the chorioallantoic membrane of chickens' eggs. In vitro, this glycoprotein seems to inhibit the growth and tubal morphogenesis of vascular endothelial cells (36963).\nAntiarthritic effects\nSome researchers suggest that bovine cartilage provides the needed biochemical components to support resynthesis of cartilage in individuals with osteoarthritis. It might also have anti-inflammatory effects (2009). Some animal research shows that intradermal injection of a mixture of high-density proteoglycan from bovine articular cartilage with Freund incomplete adjuvant reduces symptoms of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats (36970).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro an animal research suggests that bovine cartilage may have antineoplastic effects. While the wound healing properties of bovine cartilage are thought to be explained by N-acetyl glucosamine, which is found in bovine cartilage, this compound does not seem to have antineoplastic effects. Instead, some researchers suggest that other, low molecular weight entities give bovine cartilage its antineoplastic potential (2010). Some in vitro research shows that injection of bovine tracheal cartilage into tumors of the colon, connective tissues, lungs, ovaries, pancreas, and testes decreases survival of neoplastic colonies to 30% or less compared to control. Injection of bovine tracheal cartilage also showed antineoplastic activity against human breast cancer, colon cancer, and myeloma cell lines (36969). Some animal research shows that metastatin, an isolate of bovine nasal cartilage, produces antineoplastic effects in chicken and mice. In a model of melanoma in mice, there were apparent decreases in the number of pulmonary metastases following intraperitoneal or intravenous doses of metastatin after inoculation with a cell line of bronchogenic carcinoma. Additionally, after application of respective cell lines of melanoma or carcinoma of the prostate to the chorioallantoic membrane of chickens' eggs, a single intravenous dose of metastatin produced apparent antitumorigenesis. Further, in an assay of cellular growth in a culture with metastatin, there was inhibition of the proliferation of a respective cell line of melanoma or bronchogenic carcinoma. Metastatin's antineoplastic action speculatively occurs by binding to hyaluronan (36959).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nSome clinical evidence suggests that bovine cartilage can treat or prevent certain autoimmune conditions. Researchers suggest that the polysaccharides and glycoproteins found in bovine cartilage prevent autoimmunity by coating cellular membranes, effectively interfering with certain antigen-antibody combinations (2009). Some clinical research shows that, after injection of an aqueous extract of bovine cartilage and bone marrow called Rumalon (Robapharm), immunoglobulin G4 antibodies are detected and interleukin-5 and interleukin-10 seem to increase in patients with osteoarthritis (36958). Some animal research shows that intradermal injection of a mixture of high density proteoglycan from bovine articular cartilage with Freund incomplete adjuvant decreases delayed-type hypersensitivity to intradermal Mycobacterium butyricum in rats (36970).\nWound-healing effects\nAnimal research shows that topical application of powdered bovine tracheal cartilage, subcutaneous injection of bovine cartilage pellets, and intramuscular injection of saline bovine cartilage extract all appear to accelerate wound healing (92744, 92745, 92746, 92747, 92748, 92749, 92751, 92752, 92754). Researchers suggest that N-acetyl glucosamine isolated from bovine cartilage is the active component responsible for the wound-healing effects of bovine tracheal cartilage (2009, 92770). Some clinical research shows that the tensile strength of sutured wounds is increased by topical application of bovine cartilage. Increased fibroplasia and larger amounts of reticulum and collagen in the wounds were seen after applying bovine cartilage to the suture site (92753)."

Oral hyperimmune bovine colostrum seems to help prevent infectious diarrhea and reduces the duration of infectious diarrhea in children.\nAn open-label study in children aged 1-6 years with a history of recurrent diarrhea shows that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum daily for 4 weeks decreases the number of infectious diarrhea episodes during a 6-month period by around 2 episodes when compared to baseline (95924). Clinical research in infants also shows that drinking formula containing hyperimmune bovine colostrum for 1 week decreases the frequency of infectious diarrhea at 6 months by 1.5 episodes when compared to baseline (101801). Taking bovine colostrum might also reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea related to Escherichia coli. Two small clinical studies in children aged 1 month to 18 years show that bovine colostrum reduces the duration of diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli when compared with placebo (2067, 101796).\n\nThe studies used hyperimmune colostrum, which provides high antibody titers against organisms for which the cow has been immunized (4905). Doses studied include hyperimmune bovine colostrum 7 grams three times daily for 14 days in children aged 1 month to 18 years (2067); a specific hyperimmune bovine colostrum product (ImmuGuard, NMI) 3 grams daily if less than 2 years of age, or 3 grams twice daily if over 2 years of age, for 1-4 weeks (95924, 101796); and infant formula containing hyperimmune bovine colostrum 0.5 grams/kg for one week (101801).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum reduces the risk of exercise-induced respiratory infection in healthy adults.\nWhile results from individual clinical studies are mixed (92413, 92416), a meta-analysis of 5 small clinical trials in healthy adults shows that taking bovine colostrum 10 or 20 grams daily for 8-12 weeks during exercise training reduces the rate of upper respiratory symptom days by 44% and the rate of episodes of upper respiratory symptoms by 38% when compared with placebo (92417).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related diarrhea. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum reduces the frequency of diarrhea in patients with HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea.\nSeveral very small clinical trials in patients with HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea show that taking bovine colostrum daily for up to 3 weeks seems to reduce the frequency of diarrhea when compared to baseline (4905, 4906, 4907, 4908, 92415). The validity of these findings is limited by lack of control group. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum had FDA orphan status for HIV-related diarrhea (9840); however, it has not been FDA-approved for this indication.\n\nMost clinical trials have used colostrum from pregnant cows that have been immunized against specific pathogens. The hyperimmune colostrum provides high antibody titers against organisms for which the cow has been immunized (4905). Specific hyperimmune colostrum products showing benefit include ColoPlus by ColoPlus AB and Lactobin by Biotest AG (4907, 92415).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea.

A specific hyperimmune bovine colostrum product (ImmuGuard, NMI) 3 grams daily if less than 2 years of age, or 3 grams twice daily if over 2 years of age, for 1 week has also been used (101796).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum does not prevent NEC in preterm or very low birth weight infants.\nA small clinical study in very low birth weight infants shows that giving bovine colostrum (Pedimmune, Merk India Ltd.) 1.2 or 2 grams enterally four times daily until discharge or death does not reduce the risk of NEC when compared with placebo (92411). Another small clinical study in formula-fed, preterm neonates also shows that giving bovine colostrum (Immuguard, Dulex-Lab) for 2 weeks has no effect on the incidence of NEC when compared with a control group (105755). An open-label trial in very preterm infants shows that adding 1-2.8 grams of powdered bovine colostrum to each 100 mL of breastmilk until 35 weeks' postmenstrual age does not reduce the risk of NEC when compared with a conventional milk fortifier (111140). Additionally, a large clinical study in very preterm infants shows that adding bovine colostrum to breastmilk feeding during the first 14 days of life does not reduce the risk of NEC or shorten the time to full enteral feeding when compared with preterm formula added to breastmilk (114816).\nless\nSepsis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum does not prevent sepsis in preterm or very low birth weight infants.\nA small clinical study in low birth weight infants shows that giving bovine colostrum (Pedimmune, Merk India Ltd.) 1.2 or 2 grams enterally four times daily until discharge or death does not reduce the risk of sepsis when compared with placebo (92411). Another small clinical study in formula-fed, preterm neonates also shows that giving bovine colostrum (Immuguard, Dulex-Lab) for 2 weeks has no effect on the incidence of late-onset sepsis when compared with a control group. While the severity of sepsis appeared to be higher in the control group, the study was underpowered to assess this outcomes (105755). An open-label trial in very preterm infants shows that adding 1-2.8 grams of powdered bovine colostrum to each 100 mL of breastmilk until 35 weeks' postmenstrual age does not reduce the risk of sepsis when compared with a conventional milk fortifier (111140).\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum is not beneficial in children or adults with short bowel syndrome.\nA very small crossover study in children with short bowel syndrome shows that administering bovine colostrum enterally at a dose that comprises 20% of a child's daily basal fluid requirement does not improve growth or intestinal function when compared with a control diet (92410). Another very small crossover study in adults with short bowel syndrome shows that taking bovine colostrum 250 mL twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve intestinal absorption or body composition when compared with an isocaloric control supplement (92423).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral bovine colostrum for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral bovine colostrum might improve some measures of athletic performance; however, results are mixed, and any benefit appears to be small.\nSeveral small clinical studies show that taking bovine colostrum 10-60 grams daily for up to 8 weeks increases power and improves cycling and sprint time following an initial bout of exercise, but not during a normal training period (11453, 16532, 36988, 36991, 36995). Another small clinical study in elite soccer players shows that a lower dose of 3.2 grams daily for 6 weeks modestly attenuates muscle damage, muscle soreness, and decreases in squat jump performance after simulated soccer matches (98820). However, bovine colostrum does not appear to improve rowing performance, anaerobic work capacity, endurance, or strength training (11453, 16532, 36980, 36992, 36995, 37000, 37006, 92419, 114817). Differences are possibly explained by the variation in exercise and recovery protocols used (16533).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Oral bovine colostrum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical trial in children aged 3-11 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking bovine colostrum (Immucon) 5.1-10.8 grams daily with Bifidobacterium infantis for 5 weeks improves measures of irritability and hyperactivity and symptoms of autism-associated gastrointestinal problems such as stool consistency and frequency of diarrhea when compared to baseline (101792). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control. Also, it is unclear if these findings are due to bovine colostrum, Bifidobacterium infantis, or the combination.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral bovine colostrum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn open-label study in males with lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH shows that taking bovine colostrum 30 mg and saw palmetto extract 320 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily for 12 months does not improve overall symptoms when compared with tamsulosin alone. However, the combination improved storage symptoms more than tamsulosin alone, without affecting urinary flow rate, postvoid residual volume, or prostate volume (101795). This study is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nChemotherapy-related infection. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-related infection.\nA small clinical study in children with leukemia shows that taking bovine colostrum (Biofiber-Damino) 0.5-1 gram/kg daily during chemotherapy treatment for 4 weeks does not reduce the incidence of fever, neutropenic fever, bacteremia, fungaemia, or the need for antibiotics when compared with placebo (101797). It is possible that this study was underpowered to detect between-group differences.\nless\nChild growth. Oral bovine colostrum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in 9-month-old breastfed infants at high risk for stunted growth shows that giving bovine colostrum 5.7 grams with whole egg powder 4.3 grams twice daily for 3 months reduces stunting and linear growth faltering, as measured by mean length-for-age z-score, when compared with placebo. These effects are sustained for up to 5 months following discontinuation of bovine colostrum (105754). It is unclear if these effects are due to bovine colostrum, whole egg powder, or the combination.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for improving cognitive function.\nA small clinical study in older adults shows that taking a specific bovine colostrum product (Eterna Gold, Saskatoon Colostrum Co. Ltd.) 60 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve cognitive function when compared with whey protein (92414).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial in patients with critical illness.\nA small clinical trial in critically ill patients shows that taking bovine colostrum 20 grams daily in enteral formula reduces the median length of stay by around 7 days and reduces risk of diarrhea by 72% when compared with placebo. There was no effect on vomiting, abdominal distention, constipation, sepsis, or mortality (101799).\nless\nDental plaque. Although there has been interest in using topical bovine colostrum for dental plaque, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA very small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking bovine colostrum (Immuno-Dynamics, Inc.) 5 grams twice daily on an empty stomach for 4 weeks decreases postprandial blood glucose by 11% to 14% and cholesterol levels by 8% when compared to baseline (92418). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of comparator group.\nless\nDry eye. Although there has been interest in using topical bovine colostrum for dry eye, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although there has been interest in using oral bovine colostrum for diarrhea associated with GVHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Oral and topical bovine colostrum have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing HSCT shows that taking a specific combination product containing bovine colostrum and aloe (Remargin Colostrum Gastro-Gel, Solimè srl) and rinsing with a specific mouthwash containing bovine colostrum and aloe (Remargin Colostrum OS, Solimè srl) modestly reduces the risk and duration of severe oral mucositis and febrile neutropenia when compared with historical values. There was no effect on duration of neutropenia, length of hospital stay, pain, or duration of medication use. All patients were also given standard care. The mouthwash was used after each oral hygiene session, and the oral treatment was taken 3 to 5 times daily depending on symptoms (110211, 111135). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group. Additionally, it is unclear if these findings are due to bovine colostrum, aloe, or the combination.\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if intravaginal bovine colostrum is beneficial in patients with HPV infection.\nObservational research in patients with HPV infection has found that vaginal application of bovine colostrum-containing tablets (Ginedie, Tfarma) twice weekly for 6 months is associated with regression of low grade cervical lesions in 76% of patients (92424). The validity of these findings is limited by the observational nature of the study and a lack of comparator group.\nless\nInfluenza. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for the prevention of influenza in adults.\nA small clinical study in healthy Italian adults shows that taking a specific type of defatted freeze-dried bovine colostrum (ARd Colostrum, Corcon srl) 400 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces the rate of self-reported flu symptoms by approximately 70% to 75% when compared with no prophylaxis or receiving the influenza vaccine. In high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease, taking bovine colostrum, with or without influenza vaccination, reduces the rate of self-reported flu symptoms by up to 22% when compared with vaccination alone. However, viral testing was not conducted and some patients reported more than one incidence of flu symptoms during the study period, indicating that the reported symptoms might not have been caused by influenza infection (92412).\nless\nLichen planus. Although there has been interest in using topical bovine colostrum for lichen planus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial in children with malnutrition.\nA small clinical study in children with nonorganic failure to thrive shows that taking bovine colostrum 40 mg/kg daily for 3 months, along with routine treatment, modestly increases weight but not height when compared with routine treatment alone. Failure to thrive resolves in approximately 10-fold more patients treated with bovine colostrum and routine treatment when compared with routine treatment alone (92420).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial in patients with MS.\nA very small clinical study in patients with MS shows that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum 100 mL daily for about 4 weeks improves symptoms of MS when compared with non-hyperimmune bovine colostrum (37039). However, another very small clinical study in patients with MS shows that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum about 120 mL daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms of MS when compared with placebo (37024).\nless\nMuscle strength. Although there has been interest in using oral bovine colostrum for muscle strength, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.\nA small clinical study in children with leukemia shows that taking bovine colostrum (Biofiber-Damino) 0.5-1 gram/kg daily during chemotherapy for 4 weeks reduces the peak severity of oral mucositis, but not the overall risk of oral mucositis, when compared with placebo (101797).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for improving physical performance in older adults.\nA small clinical study in older adults participating in resistance training shows that taking a specific bovine colostrum product (Eterna Gold, Saskatoon Colostrum Co. Ltd.) 60 grams daily for 8 weeks might improve leg strength, but not upper body strength or body composition, when compared with placebo (92414).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum improves outcomes in very preterm infants.\nAn open-label trial in very preterm infants shows that adding 1-2.8 grams of powdered bovine colostrum to each 100 mL of breastmilk until 35 weeks' postmenstrual age does not increase weight, length, or head circumference, but slightly improves bowel habits, when compared with a conventional milk fortifier (111140, 111141). A large, multi-center, clinical study conducted in 7 neonatal intensive care units in China among very preterm infants shows that adding bovine colostrum to breastmilk, when maternal milk supply was insufficient, until postnatal day 14does not reduce time to full enteral feeding, feeding intolerance, risk of morbidity or mortality, or improve infant growth when compared with preterm formula added to breastmilk (114816). However, results significantly varied by study site where different feeding protocols were used. Additionally, blinding of clinical personnel was inadequate due to color, odor, and viscosity differences between bovine colostrum and preterm formula.\nless\nPsychological well-being. Although there has been interest in using oral bovine colostrum for psychological well-being, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nShigellosis. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial in children with shigellosis.\nA small clinical study in children aged 1-12 years with shigellosis shows that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum 100 mL three times daily for 3 days along with the antibiotic pivmecillinam for 5 days does not reduce the duration of Shigella dysenteriae infection when compared with a control group taking non-hyperimmune bovine colostrum and pivmecillinam (36986).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. Although there has been interest in using topical bovine colostrum for Sjogren syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bovine colostrum for this purpose.\nTravelers' diarrhea. Several very small clinical studies suggest that oral hyperimmune bovine colostrum is beneficial for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea in adults.\nThree very small clinical studies in healthy adults show that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum reduces the risk of diarrhea due to pathogens that commonly cause travelers' diarrhea such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (2068, 2069) and Shigella flexneri (2070).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if rectal bovine colostrum is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nA very small clinical study in patients with distal ulcerative colitis shows that rectal administration of bovine colostrum 10% solution, as an enema, twice daily along with oral mesalamine for 4 weeks improves symptom and histological scores when compared with a placebo enema plus mesalamine (9730).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is effective for preventing or treating URTIs in children or adults.\nA small clinical study in healthy adult males shows that taking a specific bovine colostrum product (Intact, Numico Research Australia Pty. Ltd.) 30 grams twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the incidence of URTIs by about 33% when compared with whey protein. However, it does not appear to reduce the duration of URTIs if they do occur (36998). However, another small clinical study in healthy medical and health sciences students shows that taking bovine colostrum 500 mg once or twice daily for 45 days, then again for 7 days starting at day 87, does not reduce the frequency or severity of URTI symptoms when compared with placebo (111139).\n\nIn children aged 1-6 years with a history of recurrent URTIs, a small clinical study shows that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum (ImmuGuard, NMI) 3 grams once or twice daily for 4 weeks decreases the occurrence of URTIs during a 6-month period by about 4 episodes when compared to baseline (95924). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. However, another small clinical study in healthy children aged 3-7 years shows that taking bovine colostrum 500 mg twice daily for 15 days followed by 500 mg once daily for 30 days preventatively, and 500 mg twice daily for 4 days if URTI symptoms develped, does not decreases the frequency of days with any URTI symptoms and symptom severity over 21 weeks when compared with whey-based control. (114819). The validity of the study is limited by the lack of a true placebo and absence of investigator-rated outcomes. Frequency of URTIs and symptom severity was reported by the child's parents or guardians via online survey every 2-4 weeks throughout the duration of the trial.\nless\nVaginal atrophy. Intravaginal bovine colostrum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with vulvovaginal atrophy shows that inserting 2 mL of a combination cream (Refeel, IDI Pharma) containing bovine colostrum, visnadine, and prenylflavonoids into the vagina once daily for 15 days improves overall symptoms when compared to baseline (98819). A larger clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that using an intravaginal gel containing bovine colostrum 2.3% and other ingredients (Monurelle Biogel, Zambon SpA) daily for 12 weeks improves overall vaginal health scores by approximately 54%, increasing the number of patients engaging in regular sexual activity to 84% from 59% at baseline. Use of the gel also appears to reduce urinary incontinence (101794). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of control groups. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to bovine colostrum, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral bovine colostrum is beneficial for wound healing.\nA small non-randomized open-label intervention in patients with chronic non-healing wounds suggests that adding powdered bovine colostrum 500 mg to wound dressings for 21 days is associated with improved wound healing when compared with conventional wound dressings (114821).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate bovine colostrum for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBovine colostrum has most often been used in doses of 10-60 grams daily for up to 8 weeks. Larger doses are often taken in 2-4 divided doses daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nThere is some concern that taking hyperimmune bovine colostrum with food may decrease its effectiveness due to the increase in stomach acid and digestive enzyme secretion (2070, 2071, 2072).\nOther Routes:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nBovine colostrum has most often been used at weight-based doses ranging from 40 mg/kg for up to 3 months or 500 mg/kg for up to 1 week. Common age-based dosing regimens include 3 grams daily for up to 4 weeks in children under 2 years of age and 3 grams twice daily for up to 4 weeks in children aged 2 years and older. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBoth hyperimmunized and natural bovine colostrum have been used in clinical trials. Bovine colostrum has been used in the form of milk or powders, loose or encapsulated, for oral use (4905, 16532, 92412, 92413, 92414, 92416, 92418, 92420, 101797). The powders are mixed with water and/or skim milk (16532). Bovine colostrum is normally pooled from various cows before use. Bovine colostrum has been obtained from Waldenstrom (92420), Danish Red (92423), or Danish Holstein cows (92410).\n\nBovine colostrum is often standardized to immunoglobulin content. One specific product (ColoPlus), contains 32% bovine colostrum standardized to 3.4 grams of immunoglobulin per 50 gram portion (92415). Another product (Eterna Gold) is standardized to >25% IgG (92414). Another product (Pedimmune) contains IgG 175 mg per 3 grams of product (92411). Some bovine colostrum batches obtained from Assendrup Hovegaard, Hasley, Denmark, contain immunoglobulin levels above 50 mg/mL (92423).\n\nTablets and gels have been developed for intravaginal use (92424, 101794). One gel (Monurelle Biogel, Zambon SpA) contained bovine colostrum 2.3%, along with betaine 5%, panthenol 0.2%, maca root extract 2%, and aloe juice 0.5% (101794).",

There is at least one case of anaphylaxis related to topical use of bovine colostrum in a 15-year-old male with bovine milk allergy (101793).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with bovine colostrum.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDue to gut closure, which occurs in humans before birth, little to no immunoglobulin from bovine colostrum is absorbed in the intestines of humans (94601).\nMetabolism\nMost immunoglobulin from bovine colostrum is degraded by digestive enzymes, including pepsin in the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin in the small intestine (94601).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBovine colostrum is the milky fluid produced by cows within the first few days after giving birth. Bovine colostrum contains proteins, carbohydrates, including oligosaccharides, fat, vitamins, minerals, growth factors, and immunoglobulins A (IgA) and G (IgG) in concentrations approximately 100 times higher than dairy milk (4901, 37025, 92412, 92419, 101792). A number of variables, such as the species, breed and health of the cow, milking time, calving season, number of parturitions, and processing procedures can impact the type, amount, and quality of nutrients and biological agents in the colostrum (114818).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in bovine colostrum for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical research in older adults shows that taking bovine colostrum decreases the expression of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (114820), while other research in athletes shows that taking bovine colostrum reduces TNF-alpha but not IL-6 (114817). The anti-inflammatory activity of bovine colostrum may be mediated via alterations in glycerophospholipid, cysteine, and methionine metabolic pathways (114820).\nErgogenic effects\nTaking bovine colostrum might increase peak anaerobic power and improve exercise performance; however, the mechanism of action is not yet understood. Animals fed bovine colostrum have shown an increase in skeletal muscle protein synthesis, creating an interest in the use of bovine colostrum for improvement in exercise performance (11453). In humans, bovine colostrum also appears to support the development of muscles (37000). Oral bovine colostrum supplementation does not appear to affect insulin response or the plasma nutrient absorptive capacity of alanine or glucose, once suggested as possible mechanisms (11454). Some evidence suggests bovine colostrum contains insulin-like growth factors (IGF), and appears to increase serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin in athletes (4901, 114817). However, separate evidence suggests bovine colostrum does not alter plasma IGF-I (16534, 11453). In humans, bovine colostrum may increase the buffering capacity of blood and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress during exercise (36992, 111137, 114817). Also, it appears to maintain testosterone levels and modulate autonomic activity during a period of competition (92422).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBovine colostrum contains growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and other biologically active components that might improve the growth and repair of the gastrointestinal system (9731). Preliminary data indicate that bovine colostrum reduces indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal injury and addition of colostrum to drinking water prevents experimental small intestinal injury (4911). Some evidence suggests that bovine colostrum promotes small intestinal growth (4901). The effectiveness of hyperimmune bovine colostrum may decrease when it is taken with a meal (2070), possibly due to stomach acid and digestive enzymes (2071).\n\nIn humans, bovine colostrum appears to reduce gut permeability in exercising individuals and critically ill patients. This is due to a protective effect on epithelial cells (92419, 101799). A meta-analysis of lower-quality clinical research in healthy adults, athletes, and adults with various medical conditions shows that taking bovine colostrum reduces intestinal permeability, as evidenced by a lower 5-hour urinary lactulose to rhamnose ratio and urinary lactulose to mannitol ratio when compared with control (114818). A clinical study in infants at risk for poor linear growth shows that giving bovine colostrum and whole egg powder reduces intestinal permeability among a subset of infants with severe environmental enteric dysfunction at baseline when compared with placebo (105754). Additional clinical research suggests that the timing surrounding collection of bovine colostrum influences its biologic activity. Supplementing athletes with bovine colostrum obtained sooner after calving (i.e., 2 and 24 hours) reduces intestinal permeability when compared with bovine colostrum obtained from delayed milking (i.e., 72 hours) or placebo (105753).\nGlycemic effects\nBovine colostrum is of interest for patients with diabetes. Bovine colostrum contains insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, which helps modulate glucose homeostasis. Patients with diabetes tend to have lower levels of IGF-1 (92418).\nImmunomodulating effects\nBovine colostrum might modulate the activity of the immune system. In humans, bovine colostrum limits the increase in bacterial load seen in the winter months (92416). Colostrum in general is a source of secretory IgA and other immunoglobulins (37007, 37021, 111138). Because of the antibody content, bovine colostrum is thought to offer passive immunity to people with enteric infections; however, some research suggests that bovine colostrum contains only low concentrations of antibodies against enteric pathogens and does not provide high enough titers to prevent disease. A meta-analysis in physically active adults shows that supplementation with bovine colostrum does not affect plasma levels of immunoglobulins (Ig) A or G, levels of salivary IgA, or other immunologic markers (105752), while other research in athletes shows that supplementation with bovine colostrum for at least 3 months increases IgG (114817).\n\nHyperimmune bovine colostrum has been produced by immunizing pregnant cows against specific pathogens, including cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in increased specific colostrum antibody titers (4903, 111136). Hyperimmune bovine colostrum has been primarily used in clinical trials; however, the small amounts of antibodies that have been recovered from people who ingested hyperimmune colostrum were nonreactive (2072).\n\nBovine colostrum might also stimulate an immune response via other mechanisms. Laboratory research suggests that bovine colostrum activates phagocytic activity (36974, 92416) and influences the production of inflammatory cytokines (37054, 92416). In human research, bovine colostrum influences immune cell activity, cytokine production, and immunoglobulin levels, suggesting more than one action in the immune system (85831, 114817, 114821).\n\nSome laboratory research also suggests that some constituents of bovine colostrum may prevent the attachment of certain bacteria to specific cell types, which could theoretically prevent infection. In vitro research suggests that the oligosaccharides in bovine colostrum inhibit the attachment of some bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to upper respiratory tract cells (37019). The phosphatidylethanolamine in hyperimmune bovine colostrum may prevent Helicobacter pylori from binding to the gastric mucosa (2065). A beta-lactoglobulin-like compound in bovine colostrum appears to be responsible for inhibition of adhesion of Escherichia coli to ileostomy glycoproteins (37045)."

BCAAs are an FDA-approved injectable product (13309).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in dietary amounts of 71-134 mg/kg daily (11120, 13308).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when larger, supplemental doses are used orally and appropriately for up to 6 months (13307, 13308, 37127).\nPREGNANCY: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using amounts greater than those found in food. Although adverse effects have not been reported in humans, some animal research suggests that consumption of supplemental isoleucine, a BCAA, during the first half of pregnancy may have variable effects on birth weight, possibly due to abnormal placental development (103350).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using amounts greater than those found in food. Although the safety of increased BCAA consumption during lactation is unclear, some clinical research suggests that a higher concentration of isoleucine and leucine in breastmilk during the first 6 months postpartum is not associated with infant growth or body composition at 2 weeks, 2 months, or 6 months (108466).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally or intravenously, BCAAs are generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal distension, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n\nAll routes of administration: High doses can lead to fatigue and loss of motor coordination.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, a single case of hypertension following the use of BCAAs has been reported (37143).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, a single case of skin blanching following the use of BCAAs has been reported (681). It is not known if this effect was due to use of BCAAs or other factors.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, BCAAs can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension. Nausea and diarrhea has been reported to occur in about 10% of people taking BCAAs (10117, 37143, 92643, 97531).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally and intravenously, BCAAs can cause fatigue and loss of motor coordination due to increased plasma ammonia levels (693, 694, 10117). Short-term use of 60 grams of BCAAs containing leucine, isoleucine, and valine for 7 days in patients with normal metabolic function seems to increase levels of ammonia, but not to toxic plasma levels (10117). However, liver function should be monitored with high doses or long-term use (10117). Due to the potential of increased plasma levels of ammonia and subsequent fatigue and loss of motor coordination, BCAAs should be used cautiously before or during activities where performance depends on motor coordination (75). Orally, BCAAs may also cause headache, but this has only been reported in one clinical trial (681).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHepatic encephalopathy. Oral and intravenous BCAAs improve symptoms and nutritional status in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, especially in those not tolerating protein supplementation.\nTaking BCAAs 240 mg/kg (up to 25 grams) daily in 3 divided doses for up to 3 months can improve symptoms, liver function tests, and nitrogen balance in patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy (68, 69, 82, 690, 92643, 97531). Oral BCAAs are recommended for malnourished patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy who cannot tolerate protein supplementation (69, 4274). When the enteral route is unavailable and when patients cannot tolerate general purpose amino acid solutions, intravenous solutions with BCAAs can be used for nutritional support; however, most patients can tolerate standard amino acid mixtures (4274).\n\nSome clinical research also suggests that taking BCAAs orally improves psychomotor function, attention, intelligence, and driving ability in patients with latent hepatic encephalopathy (684, 685, 37131, 97531). However, not all studies show a positive effect of BCAAs on psychometric outcomes (37135). There is also some preliminary evidence that intravenous BCAAs might be helpful for reversing coma in acute hepatic encephalopathy, although findings are conflicting (66, 81, 686, 687, 688, 689, 4274, 37134). BCAAs do not appear to reduce the risk of mortality or improve quality of life in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (92643, 97531).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. Oral BCAAs might reduce symptoms of tardive dyskinesia precipitated by antipsychotic drugs.\nTaking BCAAs orally seems to reduce symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (72, 10146, 13307). Clinical research in adult and pediatric patients who are taking antipsychotic drugs shows that taking a drink containing BCAAs 222 mg/kg three times daily for 3 weeks reduces tardive dyskinesia movements by 30% to 60% when compared with placebo (10146, 13307).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nLiver cancer. Oral BCAAs do not seem to improve outcomes or reduce the risk for recurrence in patients with liver cancer.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research, as well as individual clinical studies, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma show that consuming up to 50 grams of BCAAs twice daily for up to 4 years does not improve survival, reduce tumor recurrence, or reduce the risk of complications such as ascites following liver resection when compared with a control group receiving no intervention (37143, 92646, 97532, 105578).\n\nHowever, one small clinical study suggests that BCAAs may be beneficial in patients recently diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma that does not require surgery. Taking two packets of a specific supplement (Aminoleban EN) daily containing a total of L-leucine 4 grams, L-isoleucine 3.8 grams, and L-valine 3.2 grams, starting two weeks before receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation and continuing for up to 5 years, reduces recurrence of liver cancer and increases event-free survival when compared with placebo (97533). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the high withdrawal rate in this study.\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Overall, oral BCAAs are not beneficial and might even lead to worsened outcomes in patients with ALS.\nAlthough early studies have indicated that taking BCAAs might be beneficial in ALS, more recent studies show no benefit and a possible increased loss of pulmonary function and higher rate of mortality among patients using BCAAs (678, 679, 680, 681, 37154).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if dietary BCAAs prevent Alzheimer disease.\nObservational research has found that higher blood levels of BCAAs are associated with an 11% to 13% lower risk of Alzheimer disease; however, when research was adjusted for mortality, body mass index, and concomitant cholesterol-lowering medications, the association was no longer significant (100469).\nless\nAthletic performance. Small clinical trials suggest that although oral BCAAs may not enhance athletic performance, they may modestly reduce perceived exertion and fatigue with some forms of exercise.\nIn most studies, taking BCAAs orally does not enhance athletic performance (692, 1135, 37080, 37094, 37106, 37123, 37141, 37142, 37151, 92641). For instance, BCAAs do not appear to improve strength or work power or to reduce completion times for long-distance running or cycling trials (692, 37106, 37112, 37141, 37142, 92641).\n\nHowever, most research shows that BCAAs are beneficial for reducing exercise-induced fatigue and perceived exertion after prolonged or intense exercise, exercise in the heat, or exercise following glycogen depletion (692, 37112, 37124, 37144, 92642, 92644, 92645, 92648, 97529, 97530)(97535, 105582). In many cases, this improvement is observed when BCAAs are taken in combination with arginine, citrulline, or green tea powder (37124, 92642, 92645, 92648, 97529, 100462).However, some conflicting evidence exists (1135, 37080, 37094). Overall, the validity of these findings is limited because most studies differ widely in the amount and type of product consumed. For example, studied doses included BCAAs 0.17-0.3 mg/kg daily; or valine 0.5-1.7 grams, leucine 1-3.5 grams, and isoleucine 0.48-2.1 grams given before and/or after exercise (37108, 37123, 92642, 92644, 92645). Other limitations include variability in the studied endpoints and control comparisons used.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder.\nOne small clinical study shows that consuming a tyrosine-free amino acid drink containing 60 grams of the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine, and valine in a ratio of 3:3:4, reduces acute manic symptoms within 6 hours when compared with placebo. When taken daily for 7 days, it seems to continue to improve symptoms over a 2-week period (10117).\nless\nCachexia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with cachexia from various causes.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly malnourished patients receiving hemodialysis shows that taking a combination of BCAAs 4 grams three times daily improves appetite and caloric intake and increases plasma albumin levels and anthropometric measurements when compared with placebo (10147). Also, small clinical studies in adults with cachexia due to cancer or cirrhosis show that taking oral BCAAs 2.4 grams twice daily for 1 year or 4.8 grams 3 times daily for 1 week might be helpful when compared to baseline (71, 37090). This finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. A small clinical study in adults with congestive heart failure who have lost at least 7.5% of dry weight over the past 6 months or have a body mass index below 20 kg/m2 shows that taking BCAAs 10 grams every evening at bedtime for 8 weeks improves physical and emotional quality of life scores, appetite, and fatigue when compared with placebo. Patients taking melatonin 20 mg nightly in addition to BCAA supplementation observed greater improvements in appetite and fatigue when compared with placebo (108478). However, a statistical comparison of outcomes between the groups taking BCAA alone or BCAA with melatonin was not provided.\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary BCAA consumption improves cancer-related mortality.\nObservational research in adults has found that consuming BCAAs 19 grams or more daily as part of the diet is not associated with a reduced risk of cancer-related mortality when compared with a lower dietary BCAA intake of less than 7.8 grams daily (108467). The validity of this finding is limited due to unclear reporting; additionally, dietary intake was recorded from a single survey.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if dietary BCAA consumption reduces the risk of CVD-related mortality.\nObservational research in adults has found that CVD-related mortality is not associated with dietary BCAA intake or with individual leucine, isoleucine, or valine intake (108467). The validity of this meta-analysis is limited due to unclear reporting; additionally dietary intake was recorded from a single survey.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral BCAAs can improve physical performance in adults with COPD.\nA clinical study in adults with stable, stage 2 or 3 COPD undergoing a pulmonary rehabilitation program shows that taking a BCAA powder 4.3 grams, diluted in water and consumed once daily for 4 weeks, may improve recovery after exercise, but does not impact maximal exercise capacity, functional and muscular performance, or quality of life when compared with placebo (108464). The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment.\nless\nCirrhosis. Most small studies suggest that BCAAs may modestly improve certain measures in some patients with liver cirrhosis.\nOne small clinical study shows that although taking BCAAs 14.4 grams daily for 12 months does not improve survival or liver function in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis, the number of hospitalizations and prevalence of cachexia are reduced and quality of life is improved when compared with control or whey protein (37090). A clinical study in patients with sarcopenia and liver cirrhosis shows that taking BCAAs 7.2 grams for 6 months decreases bilirubin levels and improves Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores when compared with baseline (108468). Although the study enrolled a control group (whey protein), the investigators did not provide a statistical comparison of outcomes between groups. In addition, a small study in Japanese patients with cirrhosis shows that taking BCAAs 12.45 grams daily for at least 12 months improves liver function and reduces liver complications by 50% to 60% over 3-5 years when compared with control (37120). Also, taking a specific product (Livact, Samil Pharmaceutical) providing the same dose for 11-22 months improves liver function by a small to moderate amount over a 24-month period when compared with not taking BCAAs. There was also a moderate reduction in the rate of developing or worsening major complications such as ascites or hepatic encephalopathy (103351).\n\nHowever, some research providing BCAAs as part of a late evening snack has found no benefit. In one small study, consuming BCAAs as part of a late evening snack in an undefined dose for 3 months does not seem to improve quality of life when compared with a late evening snack without BCAAs (37101). Also, a very small clinical study in patients with abnormal glucose metabolism related to cirrhosis shows that consuming BCAAs in an undefined dose as part of a late evening snack for 1 week does not improve glycemic control when compared with baseline. Instead, glucose levels increased in some patients (103348). It is possible that the doses provided in these latter studies were lower than those used in the studies showing benefit. Additionally, these very small studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary BCAAs are beneficial or harmful in patients with colorectal cancer.\nAn observational study in Italy has found that increased dietary intake of BCAAs is associated with a lower risk of developing sigmoid colon cancer, but not overall colorectal cancer risk, when compared with lower intake (105584). However, there's some concern that increased dietary BCAAs may have negative effects in patients who have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Observational research in patients living in the US has found that higher dietary intake of BCAAs is associated with a slightly higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared with lower intake (105581).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if dietary BCAAs help to prevent dementia.\nObservational research has found that higher blood levels of BCAAs are associated with a 13% to 17% lower risk of dementia. The lowered risk was maintained when research was adjusted for mortality, body mass index, and concomitant cholesterol-lowering medications (100469).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if dietary BCAAs reduce the risk for developing diabetes.\nSome population research in Japanese females has found a decreased risk of diabetes associated with higher intake of BCAAs (97543). However, other observational research in people from the US has found that increased dietary intake of BCAAs is associated with an increased risk of diabetes (97536). Reasons for the conflicting finding are not entirely clear. Some evidence suggests that the dietary pattern of BCAA intake, rather than the total intake, may influence the risk of diabetes. Also, there is some speculation that differences in gut microbiota may attribute to the observed differences in diabetes risk associated with BCAA intake (100465). Prospective clinical research is needed to determine whether this association is causal or correlative.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Small studies suggest that BCAAs might reduce some, but not all, markers of muscle damage caused by exercise.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that supplementation with BCAAs reduces creatine kinase (CK) levels 24 hours post-exercise, but not 48 hours post-exercise. Additionally, this analysis shows that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are not affected by BCAA supplementation (97534). The validity of this analysis was limited because baseline dietary protein consumption was not taken into consideration as a potential confounder. A separate meta-analysis of clinical research in trained male athletes performing various resistance exercises shows that taking BCAAs 0.2-1.76 grams/kg for 1-28 days improves CK levels immediately following exercise, and at 24 and 48 hours post-exercise, but does not reduce LDH levels at any timepoint, when compared with placebo or control (108469). Most doses of BCAAs studied consisted of a 2:1:1 ratio of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively. The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment and various doses studied. Small individual clinical trials show that taking BCAAs does not affect urinary myoglobin after a marathon nor plasma myoglobin or CK levels after isotonic muscular exercise (37123, 92641, 100471). The benefits of BCAAs might depend on baseline protein consumption. A small clinical study in resistance trained males shows that adding BCAAs 0.22 grams/kg (MusclePharm BCAA) daily for 8 days to a high daily protein consumption of 1.2 grams/kg does not attenuate muscle damage or improve muscle recovery when compared with placebo (100471).\n\nConversely, a meta-analysis of clinical research in adults completing various exercises shows that taking BCAAs consisting of any combination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine ratios modestly reduces CK, LDH, and myoglobin 24 and 48 hours post-exercise, but does not improve muscle recovery or muscle force after exercise, when compared with placebo (108471). The validity of these findings is limited due to unclear reporting.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Limited evidence suggests that oral BCAAs may modestly attenuate exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nOne meta-analysis shows that taking BCAAs does not reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness after exercise when assessed at the individual time points of 24, 48, or 72 hours (97534). However, when results of all time points are pooled together in two separate meta-analyses, supplementation modestly reduces soreness after exercise (97534, 103353). Most, but not all, individual trials also show that taking BCAAs in various doses, such as 0.087 grams/kg or 5-10 grams before and/or after exercise, modestly reduces muscle soreness after exercise (37108, 37123, 37124, 92648, 97530, 97535, 100467, 100471, 103346, 108471). The validity of these individual trials is limited by their small sample sizes, variable dosing regimens, and enrolled populations, which were mainly limited to young untrained adult males (97534, 103353). A separate meta-analysis of clinical research in trained male athletes performing various resistance exercises shows that taking BCAAs 0.2-1.76 grams/kg for 1-28 days may improve muscle soreness during the first 24 hours after exercise, but not at 24 or 48 hours post-exercise, when compared with placebo or control (108469). The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment and various doses studied. Also, it is not clear whether taking BCAAs before or after a workout may be more beneficial. Some research found a nonsignificant trend toward reduced muscle soreness when consuming a specific product (Aminofeel, Seikatsu Bunkasya Co. Ltd.) containing BCAAs 3.2 grams three times daily starting 3 days before working out and continuing 3 days after, when compared to control (100467). More research is needed to determine the best dosing regimen and which populations, if any, may benefit.\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with heart failure.\nA small clinical study in patients with heart failure and hypoalbuminemia shows that taking a specific packet of BCAA granules (LIVACT, Ajinomoto Co) containing L-valine 1144 mg, L-leucine 1904 mg, and L-isoleucine 952 mg, three times daily for at least 7 days and stopping after discharge from the hospital, does not affect serum albumin or cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) when compared with placebo (100470). It is possible that this study was underpowered to detect differences between groups. Another small clinical study in adults with chronic heart failure participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program shows that taking a specific oral supplement (Meiji Mei Balance Rehasupport Mini; Meiji Group) containing BCAAs 2.5 grams and various vitamins, minerals, and whey protein, twice daily for 12 weeks increases fat mass, but has no effect on peak oxygen uptake, 6-minute walking distance, or strength parameters, when compared with no supplementation (108470). It is unclear if these effects are due to BCAAs, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHepatitis. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with hepatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with alcoholic hepatitis shows that taking BCAAs 20 grams daily orally or enterally for 3 weeks or until discharge, in combination with a controlled diet, does not reduce the risk of mortality when compared with conventional protein or a controlled diet alone (37133).\nless\nInflammatory myopathies. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\nA small clinical study in adults with suspected or confirmed polymyositis or dermatomyositis who are receiving standard corticosteroid therapy shows that a BCAA-specific product containing L-isoleucine 952 mg, L-leucine 1904 mg, and L-valine 1144 mg for 12-28 weeks, taken as two packages three times daily for a total daily dose of 24 grams, does not improve manual muscle test scores or clinical response at 12 and 28 weeks when compared with placebo (108477).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear of oral BCAAs can reduce the likelihood of developing obesity or improve weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity.\nSome observational research has found that higher dietary intake of BCAAs is associated with lower odds of obesity when compared with a lower intake (100466). Conversely, a large observational study in adults in Iran, including those who are overweight or obese, has found that the highest dietary intake of BCAAs is associated with a 24% higher likelihood of general obesity in males, but not in females, when compared with the lowest dietary BCAA intake (108465). This study did not report ranges for highest and lowest BCAA intake, limiting the validity of this study.\n\nBCAAs have also been evaluated in adults with overweight or obesity. A small clinical study in obese females that underwent a 4-week calorie-restricted diet shows that taking 6 caplets daily containing a total of L-leucine 3 grams, L-isoleucine 1.5 grams, and L-valine 1.5 grams in addition to vitamin B6 40 mg daily for 4 weeks does not further reduce weight, but may slightly preserve lean body mass, when compared with placebo (100464). Another small clinical study in overweight and obese adults shows that taking BCAAs 0.1 gram/kg daily in addition to starting a low-calorie diet for 16 weeks does not improve weight loss, but may preserve lean muscle mass, when compared with taking placebo while following the low-calorie diet (105583).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if dietary BCAA consumption reduces the risk of all-cause mortality.\nObservational research in adults has found that total BCAA intake, as well as isoleucine intake, is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, particularly in those with higher serum triglyceride concentrations (108467). However, this association was not present for leucine or valine intake. The validity of this meta-analysis is limited due to unclear reporting; additionally dietary intake was recorded from a single survey.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. The association between dietary BCAA intake and pancreatic cancer risk is unclear.\nObservational research in adults in Italy has found that consuming BCAAs as part of the diet in quantities greater than 18 grams daily is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with less than 12 grams daily. This relationship was stronger in younger males, those with higher body mass indexes, and in those who smoke or have high alcohol intake (108476). Dietary information was recorded from a single, weekly consumption questionnaire.\nless\nPhenylketonuria (PKU). It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with PKU.\nA small clinical trial in adolescents and young adults with PKU shows that taking BCAAs, consisting of valine 150 mg/kg, isoleucine 150 mg/kg, and leucine 200 mg/kg, with meals and at bedtime for up to 6 months seems to improve attention and processing when compared with a control group (37127).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial for improving physical function and muscle strength in older adults.\nIn malnourished elderly individuals, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement providing BCAAs 5000 mg daily, in addition to other amino acids, vitamin B6, and vitamin B1 (Aminotrofic) for 2 months, does not improve muscle mass, muscle strength, or physical function to a greater extent than dietary advice intended to maximize nutritional intake from food and drink (103349). Similarly, a clinical study in middle aged and elderly adults shows that a specific product (Sarcojoint; Orient Euro Pharma, Inc) containing leucine 1 gram, arginine, vitamin D3, glucosamine, chondroitin, and calcium, taken twice daily in addition to regular resistance exercise for 12 weeks, does not improve muscle strength, muscle mass, or physical performance when compared with taking an unspecified vitamin B supplement twice daily with regular exercise (108472). Conversely, one small clinical study in older adults who have had a hip replacement shows that taking BCAAs 1.2 grams and lysine 1.8 grams (Amino-aile, Ajinomoto Co., Inc.) daily for one month after undergoing exercise therapy sessions modestly increases the strength of both legs and arms when compared with taking starch. However, there was no effect on hip abductor strength of the operated leg or on grip strength or measures of independence (103347).\nless\nPostoperative infection. There is limited evidence on the intravenous and oral use of BCAAs for reducing infection after oncologic surgery.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small heterogeneous clinical trials in patients after oncologic surgery, mostly for liver cancer, suggests that receiving oral or intravenous BCAAs reduces the risk of postoperative infection by 38% when compared with control (105577).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. There is limited evidence on the intravenous and oral use of BCAAs for improving postoperative recovery after oncologic surgery.\nA meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical trials in patients after oncologic surgery, mostly for liver cancer, suggests that receiving oral or intravenous BCAAs reduces hospital stay by about 2 days, but does not reduce mortality or post-operative complications, when compared with control (105577).\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial for psychological well-being.\nA cross-sectional observational study has found that higher dietary consumption of BCAAs is associated with a lower risk of anxiety and depression when compared with lower consumption (105579).\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with primary sarcopenia or in those with sarcopenia related to liver cirrhosis.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults at risk for sarcopenia shows that consuming BCAAs 9 grams daily for 8 weeks in addition to resistance training increases strength and muscle mass when compared with baseline, but is no different than resistance training plus a placebo (105576). Another small clinical study in adults 65 years or older with sarcopenia shows that taking a supplement containing BCAAs 2500 mg, vitamin D 500 IU, protein, and other vitamins daily for 8 weeks in addition to resistance training does not improve physical function when compared with resistance training alone. The supplement did seem to slightly improve handgrip strength and body mass when compared with no supplementation (100468). However, overall the study was inadequately powered to detect smaller effects on physical function and muscle mass.\n\nThere is also interest in using BCCAs in patients with sarcopenia and liver cirrhosis. A clinical study in this population shows that taking BCAAs 7.2 grams (containing 1.2 grams of L-leucine, 600 mg of L-isoleucine, and 600 mg of L-valine) daily for 6 months improves handgrip strength, gait speed, and muscle mass when compared with baseline (108468). Although the study enrolled a control group (whey protein), the investigators did not provide a statistical comparison of outcomes between groups. A separate meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in this population shows that taking BCAAs has no effect on handgrip strength when compared with no supplementation (108473). Although other outcomes were evaluated, results are inconclusive due to the limited number of studies available for each outcome.\nless\nSpinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients with SCA.\nAlthough there is some preliminary clinical evidence that oral BCAAs might have a beneficial effect on symptoms of SCA (73), a small clinical crossover study shows that taking a particular BCAA compound (Livact) 4.5-18 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve ataxia in patients with SCA when compared with placebo (37088).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral BCAAs are beneficial in patients recovering from stroke.\nA small nonblinded, clinical study in elderly patients with subacute stroke and sarcopenia currently undergoing intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy shows that administering a specific product (Seniup; Enterogenomics Co) containing BCAAs 6 grams, given twice daily orally or by feeding tube for 1 month, modestly improves skeletal muscle index, dysphagia, gait, balance, and handgrip strength, and may attenuate muscle loss in affected upper and lower extremities, when compared with rehabilitation alone (108474). The validity of these findings is limited by the short duration of treatment.\n\nOther research has compared BCAA dosing regimens. A small study in stroke patients taking part in exercise sessions shows that taking BCAAs 3.5 grams (Hepas, Clinico Co. Ltd) daily for 2 months with breakfast is more effective for improving leg strength and balance than when taken post-exercise in the mid-afternoon. However, there were no differences in most measures of strength or in skeletal muscle mass (103352).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate BCAAs for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The estimated average requirement (EAR) of BCAAs for adults is 68 mg/kg/day (leucine 34 mg/kg, isoleucine 15 mg/kg, valine 19 mg/kg) (11120). However, some researchers think earlier testing methods may have underestimated this requirement and that the requirement is about 144 mg/kg/day (13310). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The estimated average requirement (EAR) for BCAAs for children are: 7-12 months old, 134 mg/kg/day; 1-3 years old, 98 mg/kg/day; 4-8 years old, 81 mg/kg/day; males 9-13 years old, 81 mg/kg/day; females 9-13 years old, 77 mg/kg/day; males 14-18 years old, 77 mg/kg/day; females 14-18 years old, 71 mg/kg/day (11120). However, there is some controversy regarding whether these EARs for children are too low (13308). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBCAA supplements are typically standardized to the content of valine, leucine, and isoleucine.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nBCAAs cross the blood brain barrier rapidly (10107).\nMetabolism\nThe metabolism and degradation of BCAAs is linked to the production of alanine and glutamine and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. The relationship between BCAAs and glucose metabolism is that they are associated with the glucose-alanine cycle. BCAAs are continuously released from the liver and transported to skeletal muscle. Uptake of BCAAs by the muscle stimulates the transamination of BCAAs, which results in the production of glutamine and also the transfer of nitrogen from BCAAs to pyruvate to produce alanine. Alanine circulates to the liver to support hepatic gluconeogenesis. The glucose-alanine cycle might account for greater than 40% of the glucose produced during prolonged exercise (10116). The branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD) regulates the catabolism of BCAAs. Theoretically, certain drugs might affect the expression of BCKD in the liver, although the clinical significance of this effect is unclear (10106, 10110, 10114).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBCAAs are essential amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine (66, 10116). BCAAs are found in dietary protein, such as meat, dairy, and legumes, and account for 15% to 25% of the total daily intake of protein (10116). BCAAs act in numerous metabolic processes as modulators of protein synthesis, as substrates for protein synthesis, and as precursors in the synthesis of alanine and glutamine (10110, 10116).\nAnti-aging effects\nLaboratory research suggests that BCAAs increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In humans, taking a product rich in BCAAs increases mitochondrial production of ATP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and prevents an increase in oxidative stress. The effects of BCAAs on mitochondrial function possibly play a role in their proposed cognitive and physical anti-aging benefits (103349).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that increases in the ratio of BCAAs to aromatic amino acids reduces the growth of cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells (37087).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is evidence that ingestion of carbohydrates with an amino acid/protein mixture consisting of leucine, phenylalanine, and a wheat protein hydrolysate can increase the insulin response in type 2 diabetic patients. This suggests that amino acids might stimulate pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin, independent of glucose stimulation (10118, 37104). BCAAs might also promote protein synthesis and energy production in heart and skeletal muscle in people with type 2 diabetes (13006).\nCardiovascular effect\nIn the ischemic heart, infusion of BCAA solution might contribute to energy production by reducing formation of myocardial lactate (13306).\nErgogenic effects\nThe oral administration of BCAAs before exercise increases serum ammonia levels during exercise (693, 694). It also appears to decrease muscle breakdown (694, 37093, 92647, 108471), stimulate muscle synthesis (37081), and inhibit muscle glycogen degradation during exercise (77).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nBCAAs play a role in the oxidation and synthesis of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Researchers think that dietary intake of BCAAs may be necessary to maintain pools of glutamate in the central nervous system (10107).\n\nIncreased intake of BCAAs seems to decrease the synthesis of amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. BCAAs decrease peripheral levels of aromatic amino acids, which are precursors of amine neurotransmitters, and reduce the amount of aromatic amino acids that is available for transport to the brain. An excess of neurotransmitters is associated with disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (10146). BCAAs also compete with aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine for access to the neural amino acid transport system that allows amino acid entry into the brain (66, 79, 80, 2719, 10146). This competitive inhibition is used therapeutically for amino acid imbalances that produce false neurotransmitters in pathologic conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy (66, 2719).\n\nBCAAs are also used in hepatic encephalopathy as an energy source to prevent endogenous catabolism of proteins and reduce ammonia detoxification in the brain by increasing ammonia metabolism in skeletal muscle (69). There is preliminary evidence that diets deficient in BCAAs, including leucine, might be associated with decreased appetite and the development of anorexia. Continued consumption of such a diet is thought to cause a conditioned taste aversion and involve several neurotransmitters in the brain, including norepinephrine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and nitric oxide. However, the exact mechanism for this is unknown (10115). Supplementation of malnourished elderly patients with BCAAs seems to reduce anorexia and improve nutritional indices. BCAAs might compete with tryptophan, a precursor for serotonin, for uptake across the blood brain barrier. By decreasing the synthesis of serotonin, BCAAs might increase appetite (10147).\n\nThere is some evidence that daily administration of BCAAs containing leucine, isoleucine, and valine can decrease acute symptoms of mania, possibly by attenuating central dopaminergic overactivity and neurotransmission (10117).\n\nBCAAs might also reduce symptoms of tardive dyskinesia related to increased phenylalanine due to decreased clearance. Phenylalanine is a precursor of tyrosine, which is a precursor of dopamine. Increased phenylalanine can increase dopaminergic activity. Excessive dopaminergic activity is associated with tardive dyskinesia. BCAAs might reduce plasma phenylalanine by increasing protein synthesis and insulin release, resulting in lower levels of phenylalanine in cerebrospinal fluid (13307).\n\nIn human research, BCAAs appear to improve mental functioning in patients with phenylketonuria. It is suggested that the improved mental function results from the ability of BCAAs to inhibit the entry of phenylalanine into the brain. This inhibition reduces its toxic effects on the central nervous system (37127).\nProtein synthesis\nBCAAs, in particular leucine, act as signaling molecules to stimulate protein synthesis (10110). BCAAs seem to simulate pancreatic islet cells to release insulin, which is required for maximal stimulation of protein synthesis (10105, 10108, 10109, 10110, 10112, 10113, 10114). Skeletal muscle is the major site where BCAAs stimulate protein synthesis and are metabolized (78, 10110). BCAAs also stimulate protein synthesis in the adipose tissue and liver but not in the kidney (10111). In the heart, BCAAs seem to have a specific anabolic effect on heart protein metabolism (13306). Evidence indicates most, if not all, of the effects of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is attributable to leucine alone (10108). The brain and kidney are involved in branched-chain amino acid metabolism but to a lesser degree than skeletal muscle (78). The sensitivity of BCAAs to stimulate protein synthesis appears to decline with age (10110).\nRole as biomarkers of disease\nLevels of BCAAs are used to screen for obesity-associated insulin resistance in adults and for metabolic disorders in newborns (100459, 100460). There is also interest in using blood levels of BCAAs as markers of diabetes risk in those with gestational diabetes. Observational research has found that patients with gestational diabetes that had developed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes also have higher levels of BCAAs when compared with patients with gestational diabetes that have normal glucose tolerance (100459).\n\nLevels of BCAAs might also signal metabolic disorders and risk for cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure. Observational research has found that increased plasma levels of BCAAs are associated with long-term adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute heart failure due to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BCAA levels might be elevated in these patients because their metabolism is impaired (100461).\n\nThere is some interest in using BCAA levels as markers of pancreatic cancer risk. Some observational research has found that increased blood levels of BCAAs are associated with increased occurrence of pancreatic cancer (100463)."

Breadfruit starch has a high degree of digestibility, water absorption capacity, and solubility values (26395, 26396, 26397). The glycemic index (GI) value of breadfruit compared to a pure glucose standard (GI value of 100) is approximately 60 (26398).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBrewer's yeast is yeast used for brewing or baking. Dietary supplements containing brewer's yeast may contain living cells or non-living, dried yeast. Brewer's yeast is often included in supplements as a source of B vitamins and chromium (7061). Brewer's yeast also contains ergosterol and amino acids (37162, 37177).\nAntibacterial effects\nBrewer's yeast has some effect against Clostridioides difficile and enterotoxic Escherichia coli. It reduces water and electrolyte influx into the intestines stimulated by the Vibrio cholerae toxin. Preliminary evidence suggests that brewer's yeast can reduce infection caused by Brucella species by increasing activity of phagocytic cells (7846).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that brewer's yeast can induce apoptosis in gastrointestinal and breast cancer cells (37164, 37165). Other in vitro research shows that ergosterol, a constituent of brewer's yeast, can prevents the growth of breast cancer cells, particularly estrogen receptor (+) cells, in the presence of estradiol-17beta (37162).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of a specific dried, inactive brewer's yeast preparation (EpiCor, Embria Health Sciences) 500 mg increases antioxidant protection at two hours after consumption as measured by the CAP-e assay (92823).\nGastrointestinal effects\nBrewer's yeast can increase the activity of intestinal disaccharidases, saccharidases, maltase, and lactase to potentially alleviate diarrhea symptoms (6432). In addition, brewer's yeast seems to locally activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in the gut (105170).\nGlucose-regulating effects\nDue to the chromium content of brewer's yeast, there is interest in using it for lower blood glucose in people with diabetes. Chromium is involved in several physiological processes, including potentiating insulin receptors and possibly decreasing insulin resistance, improving glucose tolerance, and decreasing blood glucose levels (6862). The hypoglycemic effects of brewer's yeast are likely due to potentiating the effects of insulin (37184). There is some evidence that brewer's yeast increases insulin release (6004).\nImmunologic effects\nThere is interest in using brewer's yeast as an immunostimulant and for preventing viral respiratory infections such as the common cold and influenza. Preliminary research suggests that a specific dried, inactive brewer's yeast formulation (EpiCor, Embria Health Sciences) might increase some measures of immune function (16117). However, other research suggests that the same brewer's yeast formulation reduces other measures of immune function, such as CD3+ T cells (92823)."

Species and plant parts differ with respect to specific constituents (27429, 27430, 27431, 27432, 27433, 27434, 27435).\nAnalgesic effects\nBridelia is traditionally used for various types of pain. In mice, the aqueous extract of Bridelia ferruginea stem bark significantly reduces acid-induced writhing (27447).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBridelia is traditionally used for joint inflammation and wound healing. The stem bark extract of Bridelia ferruginea inhibits inflammation in most animal inflammatory models (27439, 27447).

Inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption by the butanol fraction was confirmed in an ex vivo model. In a rat model of diabetes, the butanol fraction of an ethanolic extract of Bridelia leaf decreases water consumption and improves blood glucose and insulin levels, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity (106557). Similarly, in another rat model of diabetes, a hydroethanolic extract of Bridelia bark reduces blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner and improves insulin sensitivity (106556).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nBridelia is traditionally used for diarrhea and dysentery. In rats with castor oil-induced diarrhea, Bridelia micrantha plant extract reduces fecal output and the frequency of droppings (27445). In vitro, leaf and stem bark extracts of various Bridelia species show antibacterial activity against a range of bacteria. However, the activity of Bridelia micrantha stem bark extract is weak or nonexistent against some Shigella species (27433, 27438, 27441, 27442, 27445).\nAntimalarial effects\nBridelia is traditionally used for malaria.

In a rat model of diabetes, a hydroethanolic extract of Bridelia bark improves oxidative stress biomarkers in pancreatic tissues by attenuating diabetes-induced changes in reduced glutathione and nitrite levels and catalase activity (106556). In another rat model of diabetes, the butanol fraction of an ethanolic extract of Bridelia leaf attenuates diabetes-induced changes in glutathione and malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and peroxidase activities (106557).\nAntipyretic effects\nBridelia is traditionally used for fever.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBroccoli glucosinolates are metabolized into indoles and isothiocyanates during digestion, typically via the enzyme myrosinase. This enzyme is naturally found in broccoli, as well as in some intestinal bacteria (14145, 14149). Some research suggests the bioavailability of sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate, may be greater in uncooked or lightly cooked broccoli when compared with cooked or commercially frozen broccoli with a blanching process, as the enzyme myrosinase is destroyed in the latter processes. Steaming and microwave cooking of broccoli allow for the greatest retention of myrosinase activity (14145, 96188). Some metabolism of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane occurs in the colon from bacterial myrosinase. However, plasma levels of sulforaphane are approximately 20-fold less following consumption of soup containing blanched, frozen broccoli when compared to soup containing fresh broccoli (96188).\nDistribution\nSulforaphane resulting from the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin in broccoli seed accumulates in the prostate at a concentration of about 0.7 nmol/gram following regular supplement intake. Sulforaphane accumulates in the peripheral zone and transition zone of the prostate gland at similar levels, indicating that the sulforaphane is from systemic circulation (112449).\nMetabolism\nFollowing absorption, sulforaphane is conjugated with glutathione. It is then metabolized to N-acetylcysteine and other conjugates, such as cysteine and cysteine-glycine conjugates. These conjugates appear in plasma within 15 minutes and peak by 2 hours (96188). Some sulforaphane is metabolized to erucin (96188).\nExcretion\nMetabolites of broccoli glucosinolates are excreted in the urine over a period of approximately 6 hours (96188). Following ingestion, about 56% of broccoli seed constituent glucoraphanin is excreted as unconjugated sulforaphane and other thiol conjugates sulforaphane-cysteine, erucin- N-acetyl-cysteine, and the most abundant metabolite, sulforaphane-N-acetyl-cysteine (112449).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of broccoli are the above ground parts. Broccoli contains glucosinolates, such as glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin. The glucosinolates are metabolized into indoles and isothiocyanates. For example, glucoraphanin is metabolized to sulforaphane during preparation and digestion and glucobrassicin is broken down to indole-3-carbinol (14145, 14149). Some research suggests the bioavailability of sulforaphane may be greater in uncooked than cooked broccoli (14145). Storage of broccoli might reduce glucoraphanin content (14151). Furthermore, food preparation methods, such as grinding and microwaving, increase the availability of indole-3-carbinol from broccoli (98612).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn healthy mice, consumption of broccoli stalks in addition to a normal diet reduces fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, and insulin resistance when compared with a normal diet alone (108093). Also, in a mouse model of liver steatosis induced by a high-fat diet, consumption of broccoli florets in addition to a high-fat diet reduces serum insulin and insulin resistance when compared with a high-fat diet alone (108094).\n\nBy improving glycemic response, broccoli might also be beneficial for patients with diabetes. Adding broccoli to carbohydrate meals blunts glycemic response to the carbohydrate and improves glucose homeostasis. Clinical research in healthy patients shows that consuming two servings of broccoli in addition to mashed potatoes reduces the glucose peak, but not the insulin peak, when compared with eating mashed potatoes alone (99389).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal study, consumption of broccoli florets and stalks in addition to a normal diet reduces the liver inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) when compared with a normal diet alone (108093). However, a clinical study in adults with Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking broccoli seed extract 200 mg, containing 16% glucosinolates, daily does not reduce plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, C-reactive protein, interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-8, interleukin-17A, interleukin-18, or interferon gamma when compared with placebo (112445, 112446).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn an animal model of diet-induced obesity, ingesting broccoli flour made from broccoli plant stalks and leaves along with a hypercholesterolemic diet for 14 weeks helps maintain a lower body weight and reduces adipose fat accumulation without changing food intake. Investigation into the hepatoprotective effects of broccoli flour suggests that broccoli flour might decrease liver mass but does not protect against hepatic steatosis. Lastly, broccoli flour does not appear to protect against other metabolic consequences of obesity such as increased blood glucose, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, reduced body temperature, and reduced muscle strength or function (112448).\nAnti-viral effects\nIndole-3-carbinol also seems to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) (14155), and human papilloma virus (HPV) (7172, 7173, 7183).\nAnticancer effects\nEpidemiological research suggests that consumption of broccoli reduces the risk of various types of cancer (14146, 14148, 14864, 96187, 96189). Furthermore, in laboratory research, broccoli extract inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells (14150). The anti-cancer effects of broccoli are likely related to two main groups of constituents, the indoles and isothiocyanates, formed from constituents during preparation and digestion of broccoli. The isothiocyanates seem to inhibit some phase I enzymes, induce the cytochrome P450 system, and induce phase II enzymes (conjugating enzymes), which may provide cancer-preventive effects (14146, 14149, 14152, 14156). Broccoli's effects on phase I and phase II enzymes may also contribute to its antioxidant activity (14154). Broccoli is also a good source of selenium, which might also have anticancer activity (14153).\n\nOne indole, indole-3-carbinol, might be particularly helpful against hormone-dependent cancers such as breast cancer. Indole-3-carbinol induces cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and 1A2 (CYP1A2), which alters estrogen metabolism. Estradiol is normally metabolized to both 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone and 2-alpha-hydroxyestrone. The 16-alpha-hydroxysestrone metabolite has both genotoxic and tumorigenic effects and is thought to increase the risk of breast and cervical cancers. Indole-3-carbinol shifts metabolism of estradiol from 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone to the weaker estrogen and more benign 2-alpha-hydroxyestrone metabolite, possibly producing a protective effect against hormone-mediated cancers (7175, 7177, 7179, 7180, 7181, 7182).\n\nIndole-3-carbinol also induces cytochrome P450 2B1, 2B2, 3A1, and 3A2, as well as phase II enzymes including glutathione S-transferase (GST), quinone reductase, and uridine diphosphate glucuronide transferase (7176, 7187). The phase II enzyme induction seems to have a detoxifying effect by increasing water solubility and increasing excretion of carcinogenic toxins (7176). There is some evidence that indole-3-carbinol might have other protective effects including antioxidant properties (7178, 7188) and might also cause cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (7176, 7188). In animal models, high doses of indole-3-carbinol seem to depress natural killer cell activity, but enhance delayed-type hypersensitivity in laboratory models (7190). Whether these immune system effects also contribute to the effects of indole-3-carbinol on carcinogenicity is unknown (7190).\n\nThe majority of evidence seems to indicate that indole-3-carbinol has a protective effect against cancer. However, there is some concern that it might enhance carcinogenicity in some cases (7170, 7171, 7184, 7185, 7186). Since indole-3-carbinol induces CYP1A1 metabolism, it can also increase conversion of procarcinogens to their active carcinogenic form (7170). Ultimately, whether indole-3-carbinol has a cancer preventive effect or increases cancer risk in humans probably depends on several factors, including dietary factors, and duration and timing of exposure to indole-3-carbinol. For example, in animal models, there is some evidence that indole-3-carbinol has a protective role if administered before or in conjunction with a carcinogenic agent. If indole-3-carbinol is given after carcinogen exposure during the initiation phase of tumor induction, it might act as a tumor promoting agent and increase the risk of developing a tumor (7184, 7185, 7186). However, there is some conflicting evidence (7189).\n\nThe isothiocyanates formed from compounds in broccoli are quickly conjugated with glutathione and then metabolized to N-acetylcysteine compounds which are eliminated in the urine. N-acetyl compounds are believed to have anticancer effects and help reduce the risk of bladder cancer (14864). One isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, may also have anticarcinogenic effects. Preliminary evidence suggests several theories of action, including the induction of carcinogen defense enzymes, inhibition of carcinogen-activating enzymes, induction of cell cycle arrest, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms (10265, 10678, 10681, 10682). A combination of sulforaphane and selenium may also synergistically protect cells against oxidative damage. This synergy appears to occur at the levels of transcription and translation (10680).\n\nSulforaphane seems to induce the enzyme thioredoxin reductase, which has antioxidant properties. Sulforaphane in combination with selenium causes greater induction of thioredoxin reductase than either compound alone (12700). Sulforaphane increases the action of phase 2 enzymes, which inactivates many carcinogens. Sulforaphane may also inhibit the activity of phase 1 enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and CYP1A2, that increase the carcinogenic activity of some substances (10462, 10463, 12701).\nDetoxification effects\nA small clinical study in healthy adults who are heavy smokers shows that taking broccoli seed and sprout extract, standardized to contain glucoraphanin 16 mg, 8 times daily for 2 weeks increases detoxification of the tobacco carcinogens benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde as shown by increased urinary excretion of their respective mercapturic acids. However, when taken 4 times daily the broccoli seed and sprout extract reduces benzene but not acrolein or crotonaldehyde (114753).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA clinical study in adults with Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking broccoli seed extract 200 mg, containing 16% glucosinolates, daily before bedtime for 2 months does not reduce markers of gastric mucosal damage including pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), PGI/PGII ratio (PGR), or gastrin-17 when compared with placebo (112445, 112446)."

Also, urinary dithiocarbamate excretion increased mainly due to metabolism from isothiocyante. Metabolism to dithiocarbamates has also been shown in animal research (26430). Glucoraphanin, the principal glucosinolate in broccoli sprouts, was hydrolyzed by gut microflora to sulforaphane (26435). In humans that consumed equivalent doses of broccoli sprouts, conversion of glucosinolate to sulforaphane varied between individuals by over 100-fold (26431). Sulforaphane, sulforaphane-glutathione, sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine, sulforaphane-cysteine, and sulforaphane- N-acetylcysteine were all found in the urine at mean overnight concentrations of 4.7 ± 5.1, 0.03 ± 0.05, 0.06 ± 0.06, 18 ± 15, and 42 ± 23 nmol/mg of creatinine, respectively. In a transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, sulforaphane was conjugated with GSH after broccoli sprout consumption (26438).\nExcretion In humans that consumed broccoli sprouts, sulforaphane, sulforaphane-glutathione, sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine, sulforaphane-cysteine, and sulforaphane- N-acetylcysteine were all found in the urine at mean overnight concentrations of 4.7 ± 5.1, 0.03 ± 0.05, 0.06 ± 0.06, 18 ± 15, and 42 ± 23 nmol/mg of creatinine, respectively (26431).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBroccoli sprouts are rich in the glucosinolates glucoiberin and glucoraphanin.

The antineoplastic effects of broccoli sprouts are possibly related to sulforaphane, a glucoraphanin metabolite. Sulforaphane has effects on phase 1 enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and CYP1A2, and phase 2 enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferases, decreasing the carcinogenic activity some substances (10462, 10463).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of the broccoli sprout constituent glucoraphanin and its metabolites likely explain most of the potential clinical effects of broccoli sprouts. Antioxidant effects of broccoli sprouts have been shown in human and animal research and are potentially associated with antineoplastic, hepatoprotective, and hypolipidemic effects (26416, 26417). The antioxidant effects of broccoli sprouts are possibly related to a specific pathway involving Nrf2. This pathway is upregulated in the presence of sulforaphane, a glucoraphanin metabolite, in some research (95262).\nDetoxification effects\nA small clinical study in otherwise healthy adults who are heavy smokers shows that taking broccoli seed and broccoli sprout extract tablets standardized to contain glucoraphanin 16 mg with a sulforaphane conversion of 6 mg 8 times daily for 2 weeks increases detoxification of the tobacco carcinogens benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde as shown by increased urinary excretion of their respective mercapturic acids. However, intake at lower doses 4 times daily only reduces benzene but not acrolein or crotonaldehyde. The upregulation of detoxification of tobacco carcinogens was independent of genotypes associated with the Nrf2 detoxification pathways (114753).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn animal research, broccoli sprout extract protected against induced hepatotoxicity in a manner likely involving protection against oxidative stress (102154)."

Although there has been interest in using topical bromelain for diabetic foot ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bromelain for this condition.\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for preventing exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking bromelain 300 mg three times daily, immediately following an intense exercise regimen, does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness and has no effect on pain, flexibility, or skeletal weakness when compared with either ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily or placebo (10622). However, a small clinical study shows that taking a combination protease tablet containing bromelain 50 mg, trypsin 75 mg, papain 50 mg, amylase 10 mg, lipase 10 mg, lysosome 10 mg, and chymotrypsin 2 mg, four times in one day before downhill running, can improve recovery of contractile muscle function and decrease muscle soreness when compared with placebo (67838). It is unclear if these effects are due to bromelain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in non-elite male runners shows that taking a combination product (Wobenzym Plus, Mucos Pharma) providing bromelain 540-1080 mg, rutin 600-1200 mg, and trypsin 288-576 mg daily for 3 weeks, starting one week before a marathon, does not reduce the risk of a post-race respiratory tract infection when compared with placebo (96766).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for kidney stone expulsion.\nObservational research in patients with 4-10 mm kidney stones found that adding bromelain to tamsulosin is associated with a 12% increased rate of spontaneous stone expulsion when compared to tamsulosin alone (100752).\nless\nKnee pain. It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for knee pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking bromelain (Bromelin, Lichtwer Pharma Ltd.) orally for 30 days can reduce mild, acute (duration of less than 3 months) knee pain in otherwise healthy patients when compared to baseline. A daily dose of 400 mg seems to be more effective than 200 mg daily for relieving pain, stiffness, and physical function of the knee, with reductions in symptom scores of 59% and 41%, respectively (11457).\nless\nLymphedema. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome clinical research in patients who have undergone a mastectomy shows that taking a specific combination product containing bromelain, rutin, pancreatin, papain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin (Wobenzym N, Mucos Pharma) daily for 7 weeks reduces arm swelling associated with lymphedema when compared with diuretics (24560). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with primary or secondary lymphedema of the upper or lower limbs shows that taking a different combination product containing bromelain 100 mg, rutin 300 mg, and sweet clover 100 mg daily for 6 months decreases pitting, limb volume, pain, and quality of life when compared to baseline (103298). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a control group. Additionally, it is unclear if these findings are due to bromelain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking an enzyme combination containing bromelain 90 mg, rutin 100 mg, and trypsin 48 mg per tablet for at least 3 months does not affect the progression of disability, relapse rate, or central nervous system lesions when compared with placebo (99468). The validity of these results is limited by the short duration of treatment.\nless\nOcular floaters. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with spontaneous symptomatic vitreous opacities (ocular floaters) shows that taking oral mixed fruit enzyme capsules containing bromelain 190 mg, papain, and ficin once, twice, or three times daily for 3 months eliminates floaters in 55%, 63%, and 70% of patients, respectively, when compared with an elimination rate of 5% with vitamin C as a control. Additionally, patients with vitreous hemorrhage-induced symptomatic vitreous opacities taking the mixed fruit enzyme capsules 3 times daily for 3 months reduced intraocular blood by 56% and improved visual acuity, but these effects were not found for lower doses and shorter durations when compared with a control (111650). It is unclear if these effects are due to bromelain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking bromelain 800 mg daily for 12 weeks as an adjunctive treatment for moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis is no more effective than placebo for improving symptom scores (18274). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking bromelain 500 mg daily for 4 weeks for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis is less effective than diclofenac 100 mg daily for improving quality of life, joint pain, and joint function (96216).\n\nHowever, preliminary clinical research shows that oral combination products containing bromelain can reduce pain and improve function in knee osteoarthritis (6252, 91104, 91106, 99467, 99477, 103299). Bromelain 180 mg has been used in combination with trypsin 144 mg and rutin 200 mg (Phlogenzym, Mucos Pharma GMBH; Wobenzym, Mucos Pharma GmbH) three times daily for 3-12 weeks, with effects comparable to diclofenac, usually taken as 50 mg three times daily for one week, then twice daily thereafter. This product also reduces the need for rescue analgesics by 95% when compared with placebo (6252, 91104, 99467, 99477). Other studies have used a specific combination supplement (AINAT, Laboratoire de Rhumatologie Appliquée) containing Devil's claw 600 mg, turmeric 400 mg, and bromelain 300 mg, taken 2-3 times daily for 2-8 weeks (91106) or a combination of bromelain 250 mg and papain 250 mg (Nature's Life Bromelain & Papain, NutraMarks, Inc.) twice daily, plus aceclofenac 100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks (103299).\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for acute pain.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in patients experiencing acute pain due to various etiologies shows that taking bromelain slightly improves subjective pain scores and allows patients to open their mouth wider after oral operations when compared with a control (113513).\nless\nParturition. Although there has been interest in using oral bromelain for shortening the duration of labor, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bromelain for this purpose.\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for periodontitis.\nA very small clinical study in adults with periodontitis shows that taking bromelain 500 mg (Anaheal) twice daily for one week after undergoing pocket elimination surgery reduces bleeding on probing but does not improve gingival index, plaque index, or probing pocket depth when compared with placebo when assessed five weeks after surgery (111691). The validity of these effects is limited by a very small sample size and inadequate statistical power.\nless\nPityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC). It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for PLC.\nA case series suggests that taking bromelain 40 mg orally three times daily for one month, then twice daily for a second month, then once daily for a third month, helps treat episodes of PLC when compared to baseline (18280).\nless\nPostoperative pain. While evidence is mixed, some small clinical studies suggest that oral bromelain reduces postoperative pain after some oral surgeries.\nMeta-analyses and clinical research in a small number of patients undergoing wisdom tooth extraction shows that bromelain modestly reduces pain for up to 8 days when compared with control (91109, 91110, 100750, 100751). In contrast, several other small clinical studies show that taking bromelain does not reduce pain after wisdom tooth extraction when compared with placebo (91107, 96214, 96215). These studies might not have been sufficiently powered to detect a smaller effect. Meta-analyses also suggest that bromelain does not appear to have a significant effect on postoperative swelling or trismus (100750, 100751).\n\nAdditionally, multiple clinical studies in patients undergoing oral procedures, including crown lengthening or root canal surgery, shows that bromelain 160-1500 mg, taken in 2-4 divided doses daily for up to 6 days, reduces dental pain, swelling, and trismus similarly to taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g., ketoprofen, diclofenac sodium, aceclofenac, and ibuprofen) (91109, 91110, 110546, 113898, 115871).\n\nBromelain, in combination with other ingredients, has also been evaluated for reducing pain after surgery. Several clinical trials in adults undergoing a variety of surgery types, including facial trauma, hernioplasty, oral surgery, and shoulder surgery, show that taking specific combination products (Siben, Brovas, Tenosan) containing bromelain and other ingredients (e.g., freeze-dried pineapple, methylsulfonylmethane, Boswellia serrata) daily for 1 week to 3 months reduces postoperative pain (19322, 114687, 115304, 115868). However, clinical significance is unclear. Additionally, it is unclear if the effect is due to bromelain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative swelling. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical study in patients undergoing surgery of the jaw shows that taking an enzyme combination of bromelain 180 mg, rutin 200 mg, and trypsin 96 mg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard treatment reduces soft-tissue thickness (indicating the amount of swelling) at most of the nine assessed facial points when compared to control (99476). Additionally, a moderate-sized, open-label, clinical trial in adults undergoing facial trauma surgery shows that taking 700 mg per day of bromelain combined with sweet clover and horse chestnut (Brovas, Agave Group) postoperatively for 15 days reduces facial edema when compared with control (115304). However, clinical significance of this benefit is uncertain. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to sweet clover, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRhinosinusitis. It is unclear if oral bromelain is beneficial for rhinosinusitis.\nSeveral small clinical trials show that short-term and long-term use of bromelain reduces symptoms of acute and chronic sinusitis, especially nasal mucosal inflammation and edema (18276, 18277, 18278, 18279, 91105). The trials used bromelain 40 mg orally (usually the product Ananase) four times daily for six days as an adjunct to antibiotics (18276, 18278, 18279) or 6 bromelain tablets each containing enzymes of 500 International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) units for 12 weeks (91105). Bromelain is usually taken in combination with decongestants, antihistamines, and/or antibiotics. However, the studies have a number of methodological problems, and results are inconsistent.\n\nBromelain has also been evaluated as part of a combination product. A small study in patients over 12 years old with chronic sinusitis shows that taking a combination product containing bromelain 200 mg, Boswellia serrata, black currant, and vitamin D (Flogostop Forte, Humana Italia S.p.A) 1-2 times daily for 15-30 days as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled corticosteroids modulates hyperemia of the mucosa, rhinorrhea, and local inflammation when compared with inhaled corticosteroids alone and baseline (111501). It is unclear if these findings are due to bromelain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSprains. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with a sprained ankle shows that taking a specific enzyme combination (Phlogenzym, Mucos Pharma) containing bromelain 90 mg, trypsin 48 mg, and rutin 100 mg, or taking different combinations of the individual enzymes three times daily for 10 days, is no more effective for relieving pain than placebo (99473).\nless\nTendinopathy. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with Achilles tendon insertional tendinopathy shows that taking two sachets of a specific supplement (Tenosan, Agave, Prato, Italy) containing a total of bromelain 100 mg, arginine-L-alpha-ketoglutarate 1000 mg, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 1100 mg, hydrolyzed collagen type I 600 mg, vitamin C 120 mg, and Vinitrox 25 mg orally for 60 days improves function and pain when compared with placebo (19321).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that a combination of bromelain 50 mg and trypsin 1 mg (Kimotab, Mochida Pharmaceutical), taken in a dose of 8 tablets daily for 2 days, does not improve subjective symptoms of UTIs when compared with placebo (18282).\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Although there has been interest in using topical bromelain for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bromelain for this condition.\nWound healing. It is unclear if enzymatic debridement with bromelain improves the healing of various types of chronic wounds.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical studies shows that topical bromelain reduces time to complete debridement by around 6 days but has no effect on time to healing when compared with a control (113513). However, the validity of these effects is limited by significant publication bias and a small number of studies per outcome. One small clinical study, included in the analysis above, of patients with chronic wounds related to diabetes, surgery, trauma, or venous insufficiency shows that use of bromelain-based enzymatic debridement (EscharEx, MediWound Ltd), administered as up to ten daily applications of 4 hours each, increases the incidence of complete debridement over the next 6 months to 55% of patients, compared with only 29% of those using the bromelain-free gel. However, there was no difference in changes in wound area, non-viable tissue area, or the incidence or time to complete wound closure (108148).\nless\nChronic venous insufficiency. Oral bromelain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn observational study in adults with chronic venous insufficiency using compression stockings shows that taking a specific supplement containing bromelain dry extract 50-200 mg, Baikal skullcap, and horse chestnut (Lenidase, Enfarma), dose adjusted based on severity, daily for up to 90 days, improves severity of lower extremity symptoms (e.g., inflammation, pain, varicose veins, vessel induration) when compared with the use of compression stockings alone (115869). It is unclear if these benefits are due to bromelain, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate bromelain for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nBromelain has most often been used in doses of 40 mg to 400 mg daily for up to 13 months. Bromelain is also commonly used at a dose of 50,000 Rorer units. Rorer units are a measure of bromelain's enzymatic activity (113513). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTheoretically, consuming bromelain with foods containing a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor, such as potato and soy, might inhibit bromelain activity (958, 961).\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBromelain products are typically standardized through enzymatic activity.

Bromelain is thought to have antiplatelet activity (10639, 14806, 18285, 18286, 37234). Whether this interaction is of concern with topical bromelain is unclear. Interference with coagulation of burn wounds has been reported in a patient receiving bromelain-based enzymatic debridement. However, observational research has found that topical bromelain debridement is not associated with increases or decreases in laboratory markers of coagulation when compared with surgical debridement (110547).\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, bromelain might increase levels of tetracycline antibiotics.\nLaboratory research suggests that bromelain might increase the absorption of tetracycline antibiotics.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with bromelain.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral intake, the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was between 24 and 51 hours, with a mean of 43.67 hours (37225, 113513). An average maximum plasma concentration of about 5000 pg/mL was found after oral administration of bromelain 3 grams daily for 2 days (37225). Oral bromelain tablets have a bioavailability of 2% to 4% in humans, and up to 40% in some animals (37198, 37232, 37239). Bromelain may increase the permeability of the intestinal mucosal epithelium and facilitate its own absorption by means of self-enhanced paracellular diffusion (37240). Plasma bromelain retains proteolytic activity ranging from 1-1.4 fluorescent units after oral administration (113513).\nDistribution\nBromelain is distributed in plasma and blood (37225). Bromelain is distributed from blood to sinus mucosa (113513).\nExcretion\nIn clinical research, elimination half-life of bromelain was 6-9 hours (37225, 113513).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBromelain is a general name for proteolytic enzymes obtained from the stem and fruit of the pineapple (9183). Bromelains are glycoproteins with one carbohydrate chain per protein molecule with an active site represented by the reactive sulphhydryl group of cysteine (37199).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBromelain might exert an anti-inflammatory effect by altering leukocyte activation and by inhibiting prostaglandin and bradykinin synthesis (9183, 18274, 37195, 37196, 37230). However, there is some question whether bromelain reaches concentrations required for anti-inflammatory activity outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma contains proteinase inhibitors that may inactivate bromelain (9183). A polyenzyme preparation containing bromelain can increase the release of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear neutrophils in healthy people (962, 37219). Additionally, bromelain combined with trypsin prevents swelling in animal models (37200). Clinical research shows that in healthy young adults, bromelain taken orally does not affect the chemokines and cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and MCP-1, but does increase interferon (IFN)-gamma compared to placebo at the higher dose of 3000 Fédération Internationale Pharmaceutique (FIP) units (91111). The increase in IFN-gamma may play a role in bromelain's anti-inflammatory effects.\nCytotoxic effects\nBromelain has been found to suppress growth of leukemia cancer cells in vitro (37197).\nDermatological effects\nBromelain is commonly used in wound debridement. Bromelain's ability to aid in wound debridement is based on its ability to hydrolyze proteins to oligopeptides and amino acids. Bromelain's proteolytic enzymes are cysteine proteases. Cysteine proteases cleave peptide bonds by nucleophilic attack via active-site cysteine residues (37224). Bromelain may be beneficial for pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) through its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating effects (18280).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn vitro, bromelain prevents gastrointestinal fluid secretion induced by cholera-toxin from Vibrio cholerae and heat-stable enterotoxin from E. coli (37224). Bromelain may help prevent Escherichia coli (E.coli) diarrhea by inhibiting the attachment of E.coli in the small intestines of animals (37221).\nHematologic effects\nBromelain contains constituents that interfere with the growth of malignant cells and inhibit platelet aggregation. It also possesses fibrinolytic activity and skin debridement properties (10639, 37195, 37218, 37230). The platelet aggregation inhibition action may be related to proteolytic activity (18285). Fibrinolytic activity and an increase in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) may be key in the anti-cancer properties (10639)."

            "Overview": "Brown rice is the dehusked seed of the rice plant. It retains the bran, germ, and endosperm, unlike white rice which is milled (\"polished\") to remove the husk, bran, and germ, leaving only the endosperm (103624). Brown rice can be softened by pre-germination, which allows it to germinate for 72 hours before drying and dehusking (103624). Brown rice can also be processed by removing only the outermost wax layer, producing dewaxed brown rice (103626). It has traditionally been used for various gastrointestinal disorders and as an appetite stimulant, astringent, demulcent, diuretic, and tonic.",

There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of brown rice when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy or lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, brown rice is well tolerated when consumed as a food. No adverse effects have been reported when used in medicinal amounts; however, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDementia. It is unclear if consuming dewaxed brown rice improves cognitive function in adults with dementia.\nA small clinical study in elderly nursing home residents with low cognitive function shows that eating dewaxed brown rice with 3 meals daily for 6 months improves scores on the Revised Hasegawa's Dementia Scale to a greater extent than eating white rice (103626).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if consuming brown rice as part of the diet is beneficial for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes or for prevention of diabetes in healthy adults.\nMeta-analyses of clinical trials evaluating adults with type 2 diabetes show that consuming a diet containing brown rice 50-450 grams daily for 4-104 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels or fasting blood glucose levels when compared with a white rice diet (108661, 108662). Clinical trials using non-glutinous brown rice for 24 hours or 16 weeks show similar results (96996, 96998).\n\nHowever, not all research agrees. Preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that eating glutinous brown rice twice daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces HbA1c levels, compared with no change in those eating white rice (96995). Preliminary clinical research also shows that eating glutinous brown rice as the staple food over a 24-hour period helps with acute glycemic response when compared with white rice (96996). Other preliminary clinical research in females with type 2 diabetes shows that following a brown rice diet for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c and fasting blood glucose by 3% to 5% and reduces body weight and body fat by approximately 2% when compared with no intervention (18660).\n\nClinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes also report conflicting effects of brown rice on body weight, waist circumference, body fat, lipids, and blood pressure when compared with white rice (108661, 108662). However, the limited studies showing positive benefits of brown rice report very minor effects with unclear clinical implications. The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear but may be related to the slight differences between the varieties of brown rice.\n\nAdditionally, brown rice has been evaluated for prevention of diabetes. A meta-analysis of three cohort studies in healthy adults suggests that a higher consumption of brown rice is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with lower consumption (115486). The validity of this finding is limited by the inclusion of lower quality studies, reliance on self-reported outcomes, and a largely female population in the observational cohort studies.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if consuming brown rice as part of the diet is beneficial for improving glycemic control; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating adults with prediabetes shows that consuming a brown rice-based diet for 6-12 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, fasting blood glucose levels, body weight, or waist circumference when compared with a white rice-based diet (108662).\n\nHowever, some preliminary clinical research in middle-aged females with prediabetes shows that replacing staple white rice in the diet with pre-germinated brown rice for 4 months modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels when compared with baseline. There were also small improvements in body fat, body mass, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels when compared with baseline (96997). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if consuming brown rice reduces the prevalence of metabolic syndrome or improves metabolic parameters in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that eating brown rice ad libitum for 16 weeks does not improve metabolic factors or reduce the number of patients still meeting the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome when compared with eating white rice ad libitum (96998). However, other clinical research shows that eating 200 grams daily of cooked, pre-germinated brown rice for 3 months reduces the number of patients meeting the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome by 30%, compared with a reduction of 10% in those eating 200 grams daily of cooked white rice (103627). This suggests that any benefit might be related to regular consumption of brown rice.\n\nA small clinical study in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome shows that eating brown rice with 2 meals per day, 6 days per week for 3 months, reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with eating the same amount of white rice (103623). Other preliminary clinical research shows that eating sticky or glutinous brown rice for 8 weeks modestly improves body weight, some measures of insulin resistance, and levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with baseline (96999). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nObesity.

It retains the bran, germ, and endosperm, unlike white rice which is milled (\"polished\") to remove the husk, bran, and germ, leaving only the endosperm (103624). Compared with white rice, brown rice contains higher amounts of fiber, unsaturated fatty acids, protein, minerals, vitamins, starch, total polyphenols, total flavonoids, maltooligosaccharides, beta-carotene, and lycopene (14116, 14120, 96996, 103624, 103626). It also contains ferulic acid, phytic acid, tocophenols, and oryzanols (14121). Brown rice is considered a high glycemic index food (14117).\n\nBrown rice can be prepared in various ways. It can be softened by pre-germination, which allows it to germinate for 72 hours before drying and dehusking. The resulting product cooks faster (103624). Brown rice can also be processed by removing only the outermost wax layer, producing dewaxed brown rice which has improved water absorbency, digestibility, and taste when compared with unprocessed brown rice (103626). Glutinous and non-glutinous brown rice differ in their starch content. Glutinous rice is 100% amylopectin, whereas non-glutinous rice contains 20% amylose and 80% amylopectin (96995).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that brown rice extract, germinated to contain higher levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), reduces cancer cell proliferation and stimulates cancer cell death or apoptosis (14120). Animal research suggests that fermented brown rice has a protective effect against liver and colorectal cancer (14121).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pre-germinated brown rice, instead of other carbohydrates in a high-fructose, high-fat diet, reduces interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cardiac inflammatory proteins (115495).\nAntioxidant effects\nPre-germinated brown rice has stronger free-radical scavenging activity in vitro than white rice. It also decreases hepatic levels of lipid peroxide (an indicator of oxidative stress) in hypercholesterolemic rats more than white rice (103624).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research shows that brown rice increases quantities of short-chain fatty acids in the large bowel. Short-chain fatty acid production in the bowel is thought to promote bowel health (14116).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pre-germinated brown rice, instead of other carbohydrates in a high-fructose, high-fat diet, reduces aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (115495).\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nFeeding brown rice to hypercholesterolemic rats for 12 weeks reduces plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides, more than white rice. Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fecal cholesterol levels are increased more with brown rice than white rice (103624). Possible mechanisms for the reduction in plasma cholesterol and increase in fecal cholesterol include increased excretion from the liver to the gut and decreased intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol. The decrease in plasma and hepatic cholesterol could also indicate a reduction in endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver (103624).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or impaired glucose tolerance, consuming glutinous or sticky brown rice and pre-germinated brown rice improves some measures of glycemic control. However, non-germinated brown rice does not seem to have the same benefit (96995, 96996, 96997, 96998, 96999). In an animal model, brown rice fiber or pre-germinated brown rice prevented an increase in blood glucose and type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). Elevated PAI-1 levels have been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction in diabetes. Although the exact mechanism by which brown rice improves blood sugar levels is not clear, brown rice is a source of fiber and starch. Also, in an animal model, brown rice reduces oxidative stress (14118, 14119). Gamma-oryzanol and magnesium are two constituents of interest in brown rice that contribute to glycemic control in humans and animals (96995).\nNeurologic effects\nBrown rice that is partly germinated (pre-germinated) contains higher levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In an animal model of alcoholism, brown rice with higher GABA levels improved liver markers and cholesterol levels (14122, 14123).\nWeight effects\nUnlike white rice, the quantity of brown rice consumed by healthy Asian adults is not positively correlated with the risk of a one-year body weight gain of 3 kg or more (103625)."

However, other population research has found that higher intake of Brussels sprout alone is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (26189). Cruciferous vegetables might increase urinary levels of 2-hydroxyestrone, and its ratio to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which could reduce the risk of breast cancer.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Brussels sprout.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBrassica vegetables, such as Brussels sprout, contain more than 80 micronutrients, including carotenoids, fiber, minerals, phytochemicals, glucosinolates, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, biotin, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B3, thiamine, and riboflavin. Some of the other constituents include sulfur (26474) and dithiolethiones (26475).\nAnticancer effect\nThe cancer-protective effect of Brassica vegetables, including Brussels sprout, may be due to the relatively high content of glucosinolates, including sinigrin, glucobrassicin, and glucoraphanin, in these vegetables (26472, 26474, 26476, 26477). Glucosinolates are usually accompanied by myrosinase, a thioglucosidase enzyme found in plant cells. When the plant cells are damaged by cutting or chewing, the myrosinase is exposed to glucosinolates, catalyzing its hydrolysis to a range of breakdown products, such as isothiocyanates (ITCs), indoles, and nitriles (26479).\n\nITCs are sulfur-containing phytochemicals present in the form of sulforaphane (SFN), phenylethylisothiocyanate, benzylisothiocyanate, and 3-phenylpropylisothiocyanate; these chemicals have anticancer effects (26471, 26480, 26481, 26482, 26483). Phase I and phase II enzymes are central to the body's ability to protect itself from all types of carcinogens that routinely enter through the diet and the environment. The enzymes act as the body's first line of defense against cancer. ITCs generally enhance the activity of phase II enzymes and also inhibit phase I enzymes, thus reducing the production of electrophilic intermediates with carcinogenic activity, and even enhance the detoxification and clearance of carcinogens. ITCs also act as suppressing agents during the promotion phase of the neoplastic process and induce apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cell growth (26480, 26484, 26485).\n\nIndoles include indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) (26465, 26471, 26475, 26477, 26486). Some epidemiological and in vitro studies have found that I3C inhibits carcinogenesis by inducing carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases (GST), or epoxide hydrolases (EH) (26472, 26487, 26488, 26489, 26490, 26491). In vitro studies have also shown that I3C suppresses the proliferation of various tumor cells, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, colon cancer, and leukemic cells (26471). Animal studies have shown that indoles and isothiocyanates attenuate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines by inducing GST and inhibiting cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, respectively (26472). Preliminary clinical evidence suggest that eating Brussels sprout for one week increases plasma class-alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) in males but not in females (26701).\n\nAnticancer effects of Brassica vegetables, such as Brussels sprout, against hormone-dependent breast and cervical cancers appear to be mediated through their ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit DNA-carcinogen adduct formation, suppress free-radical production, stimulate 2-hydroxylation of estradiol, and inhibit invasion and angiogenesis (26465, 26466, 26469, 26471, 26486, 26492, 26493). According to the American Cancer Society and Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating, eating foods that are rich in folic acid (eg, broccoli, spinach, peas, Brussels sprout, corn, beans, lentils, and oranges) as part of the daily diet is recommended as a cancer prevention strategy, especially in women (26467, 26494). Several epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between consumption of Brassica vegetables and cancer risk (26482, 26483, 26495, 26496).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn a study conducted in humans, consumption of Brussels sprout, 300 grams daily for one week, resulted in reduced urinary excretion of 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a product of DNA oxidation which is a marker of oxidative stress (90902). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that daily intake of Brussels sprout may lead to a decrease in human flavin-containing monooxygenase activity, which may affect the metabolism of other xenobiotics or dietary constituents. The trimethylamine:trimethylamine N-oxide ratios were similar in the control group (a glucosinolate-free diet for three weeks), while the trimethylamine:trimethylamine N-oxide ratios were increased 2.6- to 3.2-fold in the Brussels sprout group. Thus, flavin-containing monooxygenase functional activity decreased significantly (90901).\n\nSome of the constituents of Brassica vegetables, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenes, flavonoids, minerals, and other phytochemicals, act as direct antioxidants, neutralizing free radical molecules (26497, 26498). The available evidence suggests that intake of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, especially the Brassica vegetables, may increase the plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and alpha-tocopherol concentrations, thereby indicating increased plasma antioxidant capacity in humans (26473).\n\nOther constituents of Brussels sprout and other Brassica vegetables, such as indoles, isothiocyanates, sulforaphanes, and histidine, act as indirect antioxidants, boost the body's immunity and carcinogen-fighting enzymes, and act as superoxide anion scavengers (26499).\n\nPreliminary research suggests that isothiocyanates and indoles (eg, I3C) from Brussels sprout and other Brassica vegetables induce phase I and phase II enzymes, which might reduce oxidative damage associated with the development of cardiovascular disease or cancer (26464, 26484). Brassica vegetables such as Brussels sprout have been shown to block N-nitroso compound (NOC) formation, which might protect against colorectal cancer (26500)."

The characteristic aroma of buchu oil is believed to be due to 8-mercapto-p-menthan-3-one and other isomers and thiolacetates of this compound. Agathosma betulina can be characterized by a higher composition of diosphenol, isomenthone, limonene, and menthone, while Agathosma crenulata has increased pulegone and isopulegone content. The pulegone content of Agathosma betulina ranges from 2.4% to 4.5% while the pulegone content of Agathosma crenulata ranges from 31.6% to 73.2%. R-(+)-pulegone is hepatotoxic in large amounts (93681). No alkaloids have been found in buchu (93682).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that buchu extracts have very little anti-inflammatory activity while buchu essential oils exhibit weak to moderate anti-inflammatory effects (93681).\nAntimicrobial effects\n: In vitro research suggests that buchu extracts and buchu essential oils have very low to moderate antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Staphylococcus aureus (93681). Buchu appears to have little to no activity against Enterococcus hirae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37261, 93681). There was very low activity observed against Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting little potential for these oils as antimicrobial agents/preservatives.\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that buchu extracts and essential oils have weak antioxidant activity compared to known antioxidants such as vitamin C (93681).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro research shows that high concentrations of buchu oil block calcium channels, which theoretically could lead to cardiac arrest (37261).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn vitro research shows that buchu oil has both spasmogenic and spasmolytic activity on intestinal smooth muscle, initially inducing and then relaxing smooth muscle spasms (37261).\nInsecticidal effects\nIn toxicity bioassay against larvae of Cadra cautella (Walker), buchu oil showed potent toxicity at 2.4 mg/cm2 (37263)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of buckwheat are the seeds, hulls, leaves, and flowers. The active constituents of buckwheat include tocopherols, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. Many flavonoids including rutin, orientin, quercetin, quercitrin, isoorientin, isovitexin, and vitexin have been isolated in buckwheat grain (11431, 11439, 37303). Buckwheat contains naphthadianthrones, which can have photosensitizing effects in animals consuming large amounts of buckwheat (18).\n\nDietary buckwheat is largely consumed as flour, used as an ingredient in foods such as bread, pancakes, and noodles. Buckwheat flour contains up to 12% protein, 69% carbohydrates, 3% lipids, and 14% water; as well as a well-balanced composition of amino acids. A buckwheat protein product, extracted from buckwheat flour, contains up to 66% protein, 6% carbohydrates, 22% lipids, and 3% water; as well as an unchanged well-balanced composition of amino acids (11434).\nAnti-allergy effects\nAnimal evidence suggests buckwheat may possess anti-allergenic properties. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, the anti-allergenic action may be associated with histamine release inhibition and cytokine expression in mast cells (11441).\nAntidiabetic effects\nBuckwheat contains a proteinaceous albumin fraction which has been shown to inhibit alpha-amylase activity, in vitro. Inhibition of alpha-amylase limits the hydrolysis of starch to more simple sugars. Animal research shows that taking certain preparations of buckwheat flour confirmed to have strong alpha-amylase inhibitory activity seems to attenuate increases in blood sugar after an oral starch tolerance test but not after an oral glucose tolerance test (100946). Buckwheat may also improve overall glucose tolerance by increasing the sensitivity of beta cells to glucose (11438, 11442).\nAntioxidant effects\nBuckwheat is reported to have antioxidant activity, possibly through free radical scavenger and anti-lipid peroxidation activities (11432, 11444). Preliminary animal research suggests this antioxidant activity might reduce the progression of renal failure (11433).\nWeight loss effects\nIt is thought that replacing energy-rich foods with buckwheat might increase satiety, leading to a reduced caloric intake and, ultimately, weight loss. Some preliminary clinical research shows that consuming buckwheat-containing foods increases levels of hormones associated with satiety in patients with diabetes. However, other preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that buckwheat does not improve subjective measures of appetite or decrease energy intake when compared with a control food (100948)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Bulbine natalensis.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Bulbine natalensis are the stem, root, and leaf. The stem and tuber of Bulbine natalensis contain bulbnatalonosides, tannins, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, saponins, phenolic acids, primarily protocatechuic acid, and alkaloids (91617, 91625, 108670). The underground portion of the stem contains sterol constituents, including ergosterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol (91619, 108671).\nAnabolic and androgenic effects\nAnimal research shows that intake of Bulbine natalensis stem extract 25-50 mg/kg increases serum levels of testosterone, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as testicle-to-body weight ratio and testicular concentrations of sialic acid, protein, glycogen, and cholesterol (91624, 91904, 91905). A higher dose of 100 mg/kg daily also increases testicle-to-body weight ratio and testicular concentrations of sialic acid, protein, and glycogen, but reduces serum levels of testosterone, progesterone, LH, and FSH (91624, 91904, 91905).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that ethanol, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol extracts of Bulbine natalensis tuber inhibit the growth of some Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Researchers speculate that the antibacterial effects of the organic extracts might be due to the tannin, steroidal, or saponin constituents. The aqueous extract of Bulbine natalensis does not appear to have antibacterial effects (91625).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that Bulbine natalensis root, leaf, and underground stem extract promotes apoptosis in human laryngeal carcinoma cells (91621).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using Bulbine natalensis for diabetes. In vitro research shows that Bulbine natalensis leaf extract modestly inhibits alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzymes and stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion when compared with control (108670).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research suggests that extract from the underground stem of Bulbine natalensis might have fungistatic effects against Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium digitatum, and Fusarium verticilloides. This effect is attributed to the sterol constituents, including ergosterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol (91619). Other in vitro research shows that the aqueous extract of Bulbine natalensis tuber inhibits the growth of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, but not Candida albicans (91625).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research shows that Bulbine natalensis ground leaf extract inhibits thrombin-, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. The exact mechanism is unclear but does not seem to be related to antioxidant activity or tannin content (91620).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn one analysis, the aqueous extract of the stem of Bulbine natalensis was found to contain 0.887% cardiac glycosides (91904). It is unclear if other stem extracts, or other parts of the plant, contain clinically relevant concentrations of cardiac glycosides. Thus far, no cardioactive effects have been reported with Bulbine natalensis.\nDrug metabolizing effects\nIn vitro research shows that Bulbine natalensis stem extract induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2C9 mRNA expression and enzyme activity (108671). In vitro research also shows that Bulbine natalensis stem extract slightly induces CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 mRNA expression and enzyme activity (108669). This research suggests that bulbnatalonosides, which are anthraquinone constituents of Bulbine natalensis, are primarily responsible for CYP450 induction effects (108669, 108671).\n\nIn vitro research also shows that Bulbine natalensis stem extract induces p-glycoprotein mRNA expression, although the effects on transporter expression were not evaluated (108669).\nFertility effects\nIn South Africa, Bulbine natalensis extracts have been traditionally used in folk medicine as an aphrodisiac and to improve fertility. Animal research shows that taking Bulbine natalensis stem extract 25-50 mg/kg increases the frequency of mating, mating success, and fertility success in male rats. Researchers believe that the increased libido and enhanced reproductive function result from the anabolic and androgenic effects of Bulbine natalensis. Conversely, a higher dose of 100 mg/kg reduces mating and fertility. Bulbine natalensis does not appear to improve the count, motility, morphology, or viscosity of sperm (91624, 91904).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that Bulbine natalensis stem extract 25-100 mg/kg daily for 14 days increases serum concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerols and decreases serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats (91623). Theoretically, this might increase the risk of atherosclerosis.\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research shows that applying Bulbine natalensis leaf gel 1 mL daily to a cutaneous wound increases the rate of wound contraction and improves wound strength compared to no treatment. These improvements might be attributed to the ability of Bulbine natalensis to increase collagen synthesis, increase fibroplasia, and increase the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts at the wound site (91902, 91903)."

Using bupleurum mixtures in combination with SSRIs greatly reduces depression severity on the HRSD when compared with SSRIs alone (104103). However, the validity of this analysis is limited by considerable heterogeneity amongst the studies, which were generally of low quality and at a high risk of bias. There were 49 different bupleurum-containing formulas used in the included studies, and these contained 103 different herbs.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with bupleurum.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSaikosaponins in bupleurum are minimally absorbed after oral administration (37394). Derivatives of the saikosaponin constituents of bupleurum are formed in the gastrointestinal tract and demonstrate variable activity (37394, 37398). In rats, oral administration of bupleurum 20 mg/kg resulted in a peak plasma concentration of saikosaponin a after approximately 30 minutes and of prosaikogenin F after 8 hours (37394).\nMetabolism\nSaikosaponins are hydrolyzed to saikogenins (active metabolites) and prosaikogenins by human intestinal bacteria (37413). Research suggests that saikosaponins are partly metabolized, and hence a mixture of saponin, the monoglycoside, and sapogenin is absorbed into the bloodstream after oral administration (37394).\nExcretion\nSaikosaponins undergo enterohepatic circulation and urinary (37397) and fecal excretion (37398). In rats, plasma levels of saikosaponin a and prosaikogenin f were undetectable 1.5 hours and 12 hours after oral administration, respectively (37394).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the plant is the root, which contains polysaccharides, flavonoids, lignans, fatty acids, sterols, and triterpene saponins, including saikosaponins a, b, d, e, f, and h and saikogenins a-g (3165, 104103). The saikosaponin content is highest in Bupleurum falcatum (2% to 8%) and Bupleurum chinense (1.7%) (3152). The roots of several Bupleurum species also contain polyacetylenes, such as bupleurotoxin and acetylbupleurotoxin. Bupleurum longiradiatum is the most poisonous species and has the highest concentration of polyacetylenes (92574). Oenanthotoxin, another toxic constituent, has been isolated from the Bupleurum species longiradiatrum, acutifollium, and ranunculoides (92574).\nAdrenal effects\nIn animal research, saikosaponins and their metabolites have been shown to induce corticosterone activity (37390). This activity was similar when saikosaponins were administered orally and intraperitoneally (37390). Proper polar balance between the sugar moiety and aglycone is reportedly important for the corticosterone secretion-inducing activity of saikosaponins and their metabolites (37390).\nAntibacterial effects\nA polyacetylene constituent of bupleurum, 8S-heptadeca-2(Z),9(Z)-diene-4,6-diyne-1,8-diol, showed activity against cultures of two Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis (3170).\nAnticoagulant and antiplatelet effects\nIn vitro, Bupleurum has been associated with inhibition of human platelet activation (3159).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn rats transplanted with Ehrlich tumors, Bupleurum 640 mg/kg daily demonstrated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity. After two weeks of observation, tumor size was reduced to 15% compared to the control group, and two-thirds of the mice were cured compared to no cures in the control group (37396). In vitro, saikosaponins potently inhibited human hepatoma cell lines (37407). Saikosaponin d reduced cell growth by 50%, while the effects of saikosaponins b2 and c were somewhat weaker. Saikosaponin b2 also induced apoptosis in cultured melanoma cells, possibly by down-regulating protein-kinase C activity (37409). Saikosaponins a, d, and e decreased adhesion of solid tumor cells in vitro (3157).\nAntioxidant effects\nSaikosaponins have been found to enhance activity of reactive oxygen species scavengers (3154, 3155, 3156). In animal research, saikosaponins have been found to enhance superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels (37387, 37386). These effects may play a role in hepatoprotection.\nAntipyretic effects\nVarious clinical studies have suggested that Bupleurum, in combination with other herbs as a component of traditional Chinese medicine, may be helpful for reducing fever (37383, 37381, 37379, 37373, 37374). The exact mechanism of action is unclear; however, a small study in rats and mice suggests bupleurum directly suppresses monocyte-produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha contributes to the cytokine cascade that induces fever (112354).\nAntispasmodic effects\nThe essential oil of Bupleurum fruticosum inhibited acetylcholine and oxytocin-mediated spasms in rat uterus tissue (3167).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, saikosaponin d inactivated enveloped viruses such as measles virus or herpes simplex virus. However, its cytotoxicity disqualifies the compound as an antiviral agent in vivo (37380). In vitro, sho-saiko-to, a combination product that contains bupleurum, was found to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine (362).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn mice and rats, a polysaccharide fraction, BR-2, from Bupleurum falcatum inhibited gastric lesion formation after chemical and behavioral stress (37382), regardless of the mode of administration (intraperitoneal, oral, subcutaneous). This effect was not antagonized by indomethacin and therefore appears to be related to some reinforcing mechanism of the mucosal barrier. Bupleurum was also shown to help maintain integrity of gastric mucosa in rats (37408). In vitro and animal research suggests that pectic polysaccharides, bupleuran 2IIb and 2IIc, may have anti-ulcer activity by inhibiting secretion of gastric acid and pepsin by scavenging oxygen-free radicals (3154, 3155).\nGenitourinary effects\nIn rats, proteinuria in experimental aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis was prevented by saikosaponin d (37397). Similarly, proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia and histopathological changes of glomerulonephritis were prevented after intraperitoneal injection of anti-glomerular basal membrane serum containing crude saikosaponin a and d (3156).\nHematologic effects\nIn vitro, saikosaponins have been found to increase erythrocyte resistance against hypotonic and heat-induced hemolysis (37401).\nHepatic effects\nIn rats, bupleurum showed a marked hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, which manifested in a relative decrease in transaminase levels and in pathological changes (37389, 37412). The effect was far more pronounced for Bupleurum falcatum and Bupleurum kaoi than for Bupleurum chinense (37400). In one animal study, bupleurum demonstrated marked hepatoprotective effects on CCl4-induced liver fatty degeneration and cell necrosis (3163).\nImmunologic effects\nExtracts of bupleurum have been found to stimulate B-lymphocyte proliferation in mice by an unclear mechanism (37385, 37406). In vitro, Bupleurum falcatum caused proliferation of B-lymphocytes and stimulated immunoglobulin production, as well as macrophage activity, possibly by increasing the number of antibody-binding sites on the cell surface (2598). An acidic pectic polysaccharide, bupleuran 2IIb, has been found to be a potent enhancer of immune complex binding to macrophages via effects on Fc receptors (2598). In vitro research indicates that sho-saiko-to, a combination product containing bupleurum, may modulate both cellular and humoral immune responses specific to hepatitis B virus-associated antigens (37388). In vitro, the constituent saikosaponin-d has immunoregulatory actions on T-lymphocytes, including promotion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and IL-2 receptor expression (3160). In mice, saikosaponin-d also increases macrophage activity, IL-1 production, and antibody response (3161)."

There are cases of allergic dermatitis secondary to using burdock plasters. Two males and a 14 year-old female developed erythematous and vesicular, pruritic, and exudative reactions in areas corresponding to the application of burdock root plasters (12667). Reactions occurred up to 7 days after initial use. Patch testing was positive for burdock sensitivity in all three patients and was nonreactive in matched controls.\nless\nHematologic\nIn one case report, a 38-year-old female developed immune-mediated thrombocytopenia after consuming a \"cleansing\" tea containing unknown amounts of burdock and yellow dock. The patient presented with bruising, mild weakness, and fatigue, which started 2-3 days after consuming the tea, and was found to have a platelet count of 5,000 per mcL. Symptoms resolved after platelet transfusion and treatment with oral dexamethasone (108971). It is unclear if these effects were caused by burdock, yellow dock, the combination, or other contributing factors.\nless\nHepatic\nA case of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver disease (DILI) is reported in a 36-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain after 1 month of taking an herbal liver detox tea containing burdock and other ingredients. Remarkable laboratory values included elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. The patient received a loading dose of N-acetylcysteine and was hospitalized for 12 days (112178). However, it is unclear if the adverse effect was due to burdock, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nImmunologic\nThere is one case of anaphylactic shock secondary to eating boiled burdock. One hour after eating boiled burdock the patient presented with redness over the entire body and dyspnea. He was found to have low blood pressure and was treated with subcutaneous epinephrine 1 mg and intravenous lactated ringer's solution containing hydrocortisone 100 mg and dexamethasone 8 mg. The cause of anaphylactic shock was attributed to allergenicity to burdock based on positive skin prick test results. Previously, the patient had experienced urticaria after eating boiled burdock (12660).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nAnticholinergic reactions including dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, dilated pupils, inability to urinate, and bradycardia have been reported following the consumption of burdock products (12662, 37421, 37431, 37434, 37435).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn rats, the burdock constituent arctiin is stable in gastric juice following oral administration (36646).\nDistribution\nFollowing an oral dose of 200 mg/kg in rats, arctiin, a component of burdock, reached its peak serum level after four hours (36646). Arctiin is converted to arctigenin. When rats were given arctiin by mouth, the area under the curve, concentration in the small intestine, and concentration in the stomach of arctigenin were greater than those of arctiin (37423).\nMetabolism\nThe burdock constituent arctiin is rapidly transformed into arctigenin in rat intestinal flora (36646).\nExcretion\nThe excretion rate of arctiin exhibited 1.80% fecal and 19.84% urinary excretion (37424).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of burdock are the root, seed, and leaf. Bioactive burdock constituents include arctigenin, arctiin, beta-eudesmol, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, diarctigenin, inulin, lappaol, tannin, trachelogenin, and sitosterol-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Burdock is also a source of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids (37422).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that burdock root might have anti-inflammatory activity (12663).\nAnti-obesity effects\nA study in mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet suggests that administering pure arctigenin or burdock sprout extract containing arctigenin for 8 weeks attenuates weight gain when compared with control. This study suggests these effects may be due to changes in the composition of gut microbiota (112360).\nAnticancer effects\nBurdock seeds contain arctiin, which may have a protective effect against cancer (12664).\nAntimicrobial effects\nBurdock leaf may have antibacterial and anticandidal effects (12666).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research suggests burdock root might have free radical scavenging activity (12663). Burdock root extract might protect the liver from toxicity caused by ethanol and carbon tetrachloride, possibly due to this antioxidant activity (12659).\nAntiplatelet effects\nPreliminary research suggests that constituents in burdock seed might inhibit platelet activating factor (12619).\nHormonal effects\nBurdock seeds contain arctiin. Preliminary research suggests arctiin might be converted into estrogenic and antiestrogenic compounds by intestinal bacteria (12665). Additionally, a very small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome suggests that drinking burdock extract 100 mL three times daily for 16 weeks slightly increases the levels of estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate when compared with control (105667).\nImmunologic effects\nExtracts of burdock root may increase immunological activity (12661).\nMetabolic effects\nTraditionally, burdock has been used for metabolic conditions such as diabetes. Burdock seems to have a low glycemic index due to constituents such as inulin, and therefore might be a good dietary choice in diabetes. However, research in animal models of diabetes has yielded conflicting results of benefit (37422). Furthermore, a small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows no changes in blood glucose after daily burdock supplementation over 16 weeks (105667).\n\nThere is also interest in using burdock fruit to prevent cancer-induced cachexia. Evidence from animal and in vitro models of cachexia suggests that oral burdock fruit extract reduces muscle and adipose tissue degradation (105668).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in the neuroprotective effects of arctigenin, a bioactive constituent of burdock. A study in mice induced with a neuroinflammatory endotoxin suggests that oral arctigenin administered daily for 28 days reduces cognitive deficits through several pathways at the synaptic, intracellular, and glial levels, and prevents the generation and accumulation of amyloid beta plaques when compared with control (112359).\nRespiratory effects\nExtracts of burdock root appear to have antitussive activity (12661)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of butcher's broom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of butcher's broom are the rhizomes (underground stems) and roots. The primary active components are steroidal spirostanol saponins, including ruscin, neoruscin, deglucoruscin, and ruscoside. These saponins are hydrolyzed outside the plant to the aglycones ruscogenin and neoruscogenin which are often referred to as the active components. Butcher's broom also contains ruscozepines A and B, aculeosides A and B, tetracosanoic acid, glycolic acid, sparteine, coumarins (esculin, esculetin), flavonoids, sterols (sitasterol, campesterol, stigmasterol), triterpenes, and benzofuranes (euparone, ruscodibenzofurane) (4800, 37485, 37496, 37497, 94778, 94781)\nAnti-edema effects\nAnimal research shows that butcher's broom root extract given intravenously reduces histamine-induced microvascular permeability by a mechanism involving alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. It also increases oncotic pressure in lymphatic vessels and slows the flow of fluid into tissues (37491, 37492, 94784, 94786).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that ruscogenin, a constituent of butcher's broom, has anti-inflammatory activity. It seems to suppress leukocyte migration by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and reduce the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (94785). Butcher's broom root and rhizome extracts have partial agonist activity at M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors, which contribute to anti-inflammatory activity (94786).\nLymph effects\nAnimal research shows that butcher's broom root extract given intravenously improves contractility of lymph vessels and the lymphatic pumping system, increasing the return of peripheral lymph to the heart (94784).\nVasoconstrictive effects\nButcher's broom causes venous constriction by directly activating post-junctional alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and releasing stored epinephrine by displacement in adrenergic nerve endings in the vascular wall. This reduces venous capacity and pooling of blood in the legs (10069, 94778, 94779). Animal research shows that intravenous administration of butcher's broom root and rhizome extracts causes constriction of venules without affecting arterioles or mean arterial pressure. This venular constriction can be blocked by the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin, the alpha-2 antagonist rauwolscine, and the calcium channel blocker diltiazem (94786). Butcher's broom also seems to have a protective effect on capillaries, vascular endothelium, and smooth muscle, reducing capillary fragility and strengthening blood vessels (10068, 10069, 10070). Ruscogenin, a constituent of butcher's broom, has anti-elastase activity, reducing breakdown of elastin by elastase in blood vessel walls which leads to decreased capillary permeability (94785)."

In an animal model, Butea superba has been shown to increase sperm count and testicular size when taken for 8 weeks (14917). Crude extracts of Butea superba tubers are reported to have very low levels of estrogenic activity. A compound isolated from the tubers, 7-hydroxy-6'-4'-dimethoxyisoflavone, has about 15% of the potency of 17-beta-estradiol at estrogen receptor alpha, and 5% of its activity at estrogen receptor beta (99717).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of butterbur are the leaf, rhizome, and root. The active constituents of butterbur are the sesquiterpene compounds, petasin, and isopetasin. Butterbur extracts also contain volatile oils, flavonoids, tannins, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (7229, 37536).\nAnti-allergy effects\nIn allergic rhinitis (hayfever), butterbur and purified petasin decrease blood concentrations of histamine and leukotrienes (10336). They also appear to decrease priming of mast cells in response to contact with allergens (10337).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nButterbur might exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis (7229, 7597). Both isopetasin and oxopetasin esters present in butterbur have been reported to inhibit synthesis of leukotrienes in laboratory research (37538). Inhibition of prostaglandins by butterbur extract has also been reported in laboratory research (37511).\nHepatotoxic effects\nButterbur contains various pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), some of which are toxic. PAs are most concentrated in the plant roots, but may be found in all plant parts. PAs, particularly unsaturated PAs, can cause hepatotoxicity. Cyclic diesters such as retrorsine and senecionine are the most hepatotoxic. Liver toxicity may result from PA-enhanced oxidative stress. Single doses of 10-20 mg PAs or chronic ingestion of amounts less than 10 mcg can cause veno-occlusive disease. PAs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to toxic dehydroalkaloids and pyrroles. Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital seem to enhance toxicity (12841, 12860). Pyrroles are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates. Some researchers speculate that early administration of N-acetyl cysteine might reduce toxicity (11988). Metabolism is also affected by pregnane X receptor induction of CYP3A4. Genetic- or drug-induced variation in CYP3A4 or pregnane X receptor activity can affect the degree of PA toxicity by increasing or decreasing their metabolism (12841, 12842). Hepatotoxic PAs are also toxic to the lungs. In animals, pneumotoxicity occurs as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Hepatotoxic PAs are also carcinogenic and mutagenic (12841, 12842). Methods to remove PAs from butterbur extracts are available (7231). However, in vitro, other constituents of butterbur, including petasin, can be harmful to hepatocytes (102700).\nSmooth muscle relaxant/vasodilation effects\nButterbur is thought to have antispasmodic effects on smooth muscle and vascular walls (7229)."

            "Overview": "",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally as a food additive (10292, 10293). BHT has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for food use in the US (4912).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of BHT for its other uses.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally as a food additive (10292).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally as a food additive (10292).",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, BHT can cause severe gastritis characterized by severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms may progress to weakness, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, unsteady gait, and loss of consciousness (10303, 10698, 10699). BHT is highly lipid soluble. It may cross the blood brain barrier, causing psychotropic symptoms (10303). BHT has been associated with development of cancer; however, BHT does not appear to increase the incidence of cancer in the amounts consumed in the diet. Some evidence suggests that BHT may actually decrease the formation of cancer (10292, 10293).",
            "Effectiveness": "Herpes labialis (cold sores). There is preliminary evidence that suggests that topical application of BHT might be helpful for herpes simplex labialis. Topical application of BHT may decrease the time from lesion formation to dry crust formation by about 0.4 days; and it may decrease the duration of the vesicle-ulcer stage by about 0.8 days (10294). More evidence is needed to rate BHT for this use.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nORAL: No typical dosage. However, the typical dietary consumption of BHT is less than 0.1 mg/kg/day (10292).\n\nTOPICAL: For treating herpes simplex labialis, BHT 15% in mineral oil applied 4 times daily for 5 days has been used (10294).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "BHT is a synthetic phenolic, hydrophobic chemical that is used extensively as an antioxidant in foods, pharmaceutical preparations, and other manufacturing processes (10293, 10697). BHT may exert antiviral effects by interfering with membrane function in viruses that have a lipid envelope. BHT is lipid soluble and remains in highly lipid soluble regions, such as membranes (10295, 10697). However, BHT does not appear to affect plaque diameter in cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) (10295)."
