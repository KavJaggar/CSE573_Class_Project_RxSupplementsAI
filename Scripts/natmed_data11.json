            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts are the fruit, seeds, leaves, latex, bark, and roots of jackfruit. The seeds and fruit have been used for food, while the leaves and roots have been used orally for medicinal purposes. Jackfruit latex and bark are usually used topically for medicinal purposes (98374, 98375, 98396). Jackfruit seeds have been shown to contain about 5% protein and 11% dietary fiber (98375). Jacalin, a lectin isolated from jackfruit seeds, is considered the major protein of the seeds (26880, 26882, 26888, 26889, 26890, 26891). Jackfruit seeds have also been shown to contain potassium, calcium, manganese and magnesium (26892, 98376). The flesh of jackfruit is a source of carbohydrates, vitamin A, and also fiber and protein (98375).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using jackfruit for inflammatory disorders. Preliminary research shows that certain phenolic constituents in jackfruit such norartocarpetin, oxyresveratrol, and especially artocarpesin have in vitro anti-inflammatory effects, such as reducing protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) (98374).\nAntibacterial activity\nTraditionally, jackfruit bark is made into poultices to be used topically, while jackfruit leaves are heated and placed on wounds to prevent infection and promote healing. In vitro evidence suggests that extracts of jackfruit bark, wood, leaves, fruit, and seeds have antibacterial effects (26877, 98396).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn traditional Ayurvedic medicine, the hot water extract of mature jackfruit leaves is used to reduce blood sugar in diabetes (98375). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking jackfruit leaf extract orally can attenuate postprandial percentage increases in blood glucose in patients with diabetes (26885). Additional preliminary clinical research shows that jackfruit meal has a low glycemic index. It contains compounds such as lectin which can bind glucose slowing its absorption or digestion resulting in a lower glycemic response (98375).\nAntifungal activity\nIn vitro research shows that jackin, a chitin-binding lectin from jackfruit, inhibits the growth of Fusarium moniliforme and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26382). However, other in vitro research suggests that extracts of jackfruit bark, wood, leaves, fruit, and seeds do not have antifungal activity (26877).\nAntiviral activity\nIn vitro research shows that a jackfruit lectin has antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus (26879).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that polysaccharides extracted from jackfruit pulp have protective effects on intestinal barrier function, possibly by inhibiting inflammatory genes, increasing the expression of occludin, a protein involved in the regulation of the intestinal barrier, and activating signaling pathways associated with short-chain fatty acid production (112154).\nHematological effects\nThere is interest in using jackfruit latex to reduce the formation of clots in disorders such as strokes, pulmonary embolus, and deep vein thrombosis. In vitro studies suggest that jackfruit milky latex contains a glycoprotein constituent that might prolong the activated partial thrombin time (aPTT) by inhibiting serine protease and reducing the activity of blood coagulation factors XIa and alpha-XIIa (98376). Jackfruit latex also contains a protease constituent that has been shown to have fibrinolytic activity in vitro (98377). Other in vitro research suggests that jackin, a lectin isolated from jackfruit seeds, induces hemagglutination in human and rabbit erythrocytes (26382).\nImmunological activity\nIn vitro research suggests that various lectins extracted from jackfruit, particularly the seeds, exhibit immunostimulative effects, mainly with respect to lymphoblastic transformation and mitogenic stimulation, often by stimulating CD4+ T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (26879, 26880, 26881, 26882, 26883, 26884)."

The fruit is also rich in vitamins and minerals (99066). Jambolan bark contains tannins, sterols such as beta-sitosterol, triterpenes (betulinic acid, friedelin, eugenin), and flavonoids (myricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and astragalin) (18).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests jambolan bark extract might have anti-inflammatory activity, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. However, it doesn't seem to have ulcerogenic effects (13603). Some research suggests that tannins extracted from jambolan might have gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic effects (13606).\nAnti-obesity effects\nResearch in rats fed a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet shows that giving jambolan seed powder reduces weight gain, adipose tissue weights, plasma lipid levels, and liver function changes compared with control rats receiving the diet alone. Liver function tests are improved, and inflammatory cell infiltration, fatty droplet deposition, and fibrosis in the liver are prevented (99063).\nAnti-oxidant effects\nPreliminary research indicates that jambolan seed and fruit pulp extracts have antioxidant effects (13604, 13605, 99065). In obese rats, giving jambolan seed powder for 56 days is associated with increases in antioxidant enzyme activity, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione (99063). Jambolan seed extracts also appear to reduce tissue damage in the brain in experimental models of diabetes, possibly through an antioxidant effect (13607). Jambolan seed extracts also seem to protect against the effects of exposure to gamma radiation (13608).\nAnticancer effects\nJambolan fruit pulp and seed extracts have shown antiproliferative activity against human lung cancer cells in vitro (99065).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research indicates that jambolan leaves and fruit do not have antidiabetic activity (13092, 13588, 13596, 13597, 13598), while extracts of the seeds and bark do (13599, 13600, 13601, 99063). However, diabetic mice that received a triterpenoid-enriched extract of jambolan fruit for 10 days had reductions in hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Jambolan seemed to work by protecting pancreatic islet morphology, preserving pancreatic beta-cell function and improving insulin secretion (99066). Other preliminary research in animals suggests that jambolan seed might have a lipid-lowering effect in diabetes-related hyperlipidemia (13602).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary research suggests jambolan seed extracts might have antibacterial and antifungal activity (13609). Other preliminary research suggests essential oil in jambolan leaves might also have antibacterial effects (13610). In vitro, extracts of jambolan bark and leaves have shown virucidal activity against the H5N1 avian influenza virus (99064).\nEffects on hepatic enzymes\nInhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzymes by a jambolan seed extract has been reported in vitro. There was also dose-dependent inhibition of diclofenac metabolism which occurs via CYP2C9 (99067). The in vitro tests also suggested that jambolan seed extract causes very weak inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which is unlikely to be clinically significant (99067)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Population research suggests that individuals who consume dried or pickled Japanese apricot at least once daily are 37% less likely to have GERD and approximately 28% less likely to have symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility when compared to those who consume Japanese apricot less than once daily. However, consumption of Japanese apricot does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of reflux symptoms. Also, benefits do not occur in elderly individuals or in those with Helicobacter pylori infection (100020).\nHelicobacter pylori. A small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a 1% Japanese apricot solution, known as Bainiku-ekisu solution, 130 mL twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce Helicobacter pylori infection compared with baseline (100029). Also, population research shows that consuming dried or pickled Japanese apricot at least three times daily is not associated with a reduced rate of H. pylori infection when compared to consuming Japanese apricot less often. However, when stratified by age, there is some evidence that higher intake of dried or pickled Japanese apricot may reduce the risk of H. pylori infection in younger but not elderly patients (100026). Further clinical research is needed in a larger population.\nHepatitis C. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hepatitis C shows that taking Japanese apricot extract (Misatol ME, AdaBio Co.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Japanese apricot.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn rats, constituents of Japanese apricot fruit, including malic, protocatechuic, vanillic, quinic, citric, ferulic, syringic, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic, and chlorogenic acids and amygdalin, are rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with times to peak plasma concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 0.92 hours (114032).\nDistribution\nIn rats, the constituents of Japanese apricot fruit with the highest peak plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curves are malic and citric acids. Ferulic and vanillic acids undergo enterohepatic recirculation, giving double-peaked plasma concentration-time curves (114032).\nExcretion\nIn rats, malic acid, citric acid, quinic acid, and amygdalin are excreted rapidly with half-lives of about 3, 2.75, 5, and 4 hours respectively. Constituents with longer half-lives include neochlorogenic acid (about 8 hours), syringic acid (about 11 hours), and protocatechuic, vanillic, ferulic, cryptochlorogenic, and chlorogenic acids (all about 9 hours) (114032).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Japanese apricot are the seed, flower, branch, root, and fruit. The fruit contains phenols, organic acids (citric, malic, chlorogenic, protocatechuic, vanillic, caffeic, D-quinic, ferulic, syringic, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic, maslinic, and corosolic acids), furfural, furfuryl alcohol, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, benzyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, rutin, lignans including syringaresinol, sterols, terpenes, alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and triterpenoic acids (13198, 13201, 100021, 100023, 100027, 114030, 114032). The fruit is also a source of fiber (100016). The raw fruit is considered toxic because it contains the cyanogenic glycosides prunasin and amygdalin (13198). Processing by pickling in vinegar, liquor, or syrup to produce a fruit juice concentrate, eliminates the cyanogenic glycosides (13198). Japanese apricot flowers contain two polyacylated sucroses referred to as prunose I and prunose II, as well as 2-O-acetylrutin and 2-O-acetyl-3-O-methylrutin (13199). The seeds contain an aminopeptidase (13197).\nAnti-bacterial effects\nJapanese apricot has shown anti-bacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in animal models. The lignan syringaresinol, found in Japanese apricot, is thought to inhibit the migration of Helicobacter pylori. However, a small study in humans does not support a clinical effect for most patients (100023, 100026, 100029).\nAnti-stress effects\nJapanese apricot is traditionally used for menopause. In an animal menopause model, two constituents of Japanese apricot - benzyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and chlorogenic acid - inhibited bradykinin and prostaglandin E2 and stimulated the recovery of levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The chlorogenic acid constituent decreased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) following induced stress (13201).\nAnticancer effects\nJapanese apricot is traditionally used for cancer. The extract has shown anticancer effects in various cell lines in vitro. Possible mechanisms include inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by altering cellular signaling and/or by affecting cellular-mediated immunity (100023, 100025).\nCardiovascular effects\nSeveral constituents of Japanese apricot have been shown to increase blood fluidity in vitro, including citric and malic acids, and furfuryl alcohol, as well as mumefural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural which are produced by heating Japanese apricot (13198). An ethanol extract of Japanese apricot bark has vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects in rats. The extract produces vascular smooth muscle relaxation via the nitric oxide / soluble guanylate cyclase / cyclic guanosine monophosphate and prostaglandin-I2 pathways and potassium channel activation (114030).\nExercise effects\nJapanese apricot is traditionally used for fatigue. In an animal model of exercise-induced fatigue, it protects against the breakdown of muscle glycogen, possibly by inducing the use of fatty acids for fuel (100013). It also reduces lactate dehydrogenase activity and increases citrate synthase activity in rat skeletal muscle, inhibits accumulation of lactate and inorganic phosphate in serum, and reduces muscle injury by decreasing malondialdehyde and increasing glutathione peroxidase activity (114031). In humans with unexplained chronic muscle fatigue, taking Japanese apricot fermented juice orally, 70 mL daily for 8 weeks, reduces fatigue severity scale scores, but there is a strong and similar effect with placebo (114031).\nHepatoprotective effects\nJapanese apricot has shown hepatoprotective effects in human and animal studies, resulting in reduced plasma levels of liver enzymes (100018, 100023, 100027). The hepatoprotective effects of Japanese apricot are possibly related to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (100027). Possible active constituents based on laboratory research are the triterpenoic acids (100023, 100027). In an animal model, various compounds were found in the blood after giving Japanese apricot, including saikosaponin BK1, N-2-[4-(3,3-Dimethylallyloxy) phenyl] ethylcinnamide, and ganoderiol 1. It is possible that these are constituents or metabolites of the fruit that play a role in the hepatoprotective effects of Japanese apricot (100018).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn an animal diabetic model, Japanese apricot normalizes fasting glucose levels. The mechanism of action seems to be related to the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma (100022).\nHypolipemic effects\nJapanese apricot is traditionally used to prevent cardiovascular disease. In human research, the extract reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides in healthy individuals (100027). Japanese apricot extract has also been shown to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in vitro (100027).\nHypouricemic effects\nJapanese apricot is traditionally used as part of gout medications. One potential mechanism is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, resulting in the normalization of uric acid levels, as shown in an animal model (100015)."

Biologically active constituents in Japanese persimmon include amino acids, carotenoids, flavonoids, tannins, catechins, procyanidins, polyphenols, vitamin A, and vitamin C (100450, 104761). The main polyphenol constituents of Japanese fruit extract include gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate (104761). Fermenting Japanese persimmon fruit appears to increase the concentration of gallic acid and decrease the concentration of other polyphenol constituents (104760).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nAnimal research shows that Japanese persimmon fruit extract reduces erythema, swelling, synovitis, and cartilage damage in rats with chemically-induced arthritis. This effect is thought to be a result of anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant activity (104761).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that Japanese persimmon fruit extract reduces chemically-induced paw edema. This effect is thought to be a result of anti-inflammatory action (104761).\nAnti-obesity effects\nFermented Japanese persimmon fruit extract may reduce fatty acid synthesis via activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and downregulation of related genes in mice. Animal research shows that fermented Japanese persimmon fruit extract may reduce body weight, abdominal fat, liver fat, and cholesterol in mice that are fed high-fat diets (104760).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary research suggests that the peel of Japanese persimmon fruit might have antitumor effects (13390).\nAntioxidant effects\nJapanese persimmon extracts have antioxidant effects, which are thought to reduce the harm of gamma radiation, cardiovascular disease, and aging (100448, 100452, 100458, 104761). Naoxinqing (NXQ) tablet, a standardized herbal product that contains extract of Japanese persimmon leaves, is traditionally used for its purported antioxidant effects in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In vitro research shows that quercetin and kaempferol, ingredients isolated from Japanese persimmon leaf, have antioxidant activity (100448).\n\nIn vitro research also shows that proanthocyanidins extracted with acetone from Japanese persimmon peel reduce oxidative damage and expression of sirtuin 1 in a hydrogen peroxide-induced cellular senescence model. This suggests an anti-aging effect (100452).\nAntipyretic effects\nJapanese persimmon fruit appears to lower peripheral human body temperature (13389).\nAntiviral effects\nThere is interest in using Japanese persimmon for its antiviral activity. In vitro research shows that Japanese persimmon extracts containing 22% tannins inhibit viral attachment to cells and inhibit viral infectivity. Tested viruses included influenza virus H3N2, H5N3, herpes simplex virus-1, poliovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and others (100455).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using Japanese persimmon for slowing osteoporosis. Animal research shows that polysaccharides isolated from Japanese persimmon leaves reduce osteoclast activity and bone loss in mice models of postmenopausal osteoporosis (100447).\nCardiovascular effects\nBoth Japanese persimmon leaf and fruit juice reportedly have hypotensive effects (13389). Japanese persimmon leaf contains flavonoids such as astragalin. Astragalin seems to have hypotensive effects, possibly by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity (13388).\n\nExtracts of Japanese persimmon leaf seem to have vasorelaxant activity, which might explain its use for hypertension. It might stimulate the release of the endothelial vasodilator, nitric oxide (13385). The leaf extract might also have free radical scavenging activity (13386). Other preliminary research suggests it might have immunological activity (13387).\n\nExtracts of Japanese persimmon leaf also seem to have anticoagulant properties. Research in vitro shows that certain Japanese persimmon leaf extract protein fractions have anticoagulant activity. These fractions are thought to bind fibrinogen leading to thrombin inactivation (100454).\nDermatologic effects\nJapanese persimmon leaf extract and astragalin appear to inhibit histamine release from mast cells (13388, 100450). Animal models of atopic dermatitis suggest that oral administration might relieve symptoms (13388). There is also interest in using Japanese persimmon leaves to prevent wrinkles and dark coloration. In vitro, ethanolic extracts of Japanese persimmon leaves inhibit xanthine oxidase inhibition, tyrosinase, collagenase, and elastase enzymes, which suggests that this extract has whitening and anti-wrinkle effects (100445).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in using flavonoids from Japanese persimmon to slow progression of Alzheimer disease. Research from animal models shows that Japanese persimmon leaf extracts reduce learning and memory impairment, B-amyloid peptide production, and senile plaque activation (100453).\nOcular effects\nThere is interest in using Japanese persimmon to slow retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy because of its antioxidant effects and effects on angiogenesis. Animal models of AMD suggest that Japanese persimmon leaf extract increases retinal thickness and reduces oxidant effects of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (100451). Animal research also suggests that Japanese persimmon ethanol extract improves angiogenesis and corneal neovascularization after alkali burns to the cornea (100457)."

Jasmine contains iridoids, such as ligstroside and oleuropein, secoiridoid glucosides, alkaloids, sterols, fatty acids, triterpenes, lignans, flavonoids, and terpenoids (56960, 56997, 110677). The flowers contain ligustin, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol (110678).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA methanol extract of the aerial parts of jasmine given in a dose of 400 mg/kg orally has anti-inflammatory activity in rat models of ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The extract reduces ulcerative colitis disease activity similarly to prednisolone 2 mg/kg. It reduces proinflammatory myeloperoxidase, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 in colonic tissues. It also increases levels of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin in colonic epithelial cells (110677).\n\nIn the rat RA model, the extract reduces levels of rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, cathepsin-D, nitric oxide, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. It also reduces bone histopathological lesions, articular cartilage damage, and inflammation of synovial membrane and periarticular tissues, when compared with control animals (110677).\nAnticancer effects\nJasmine is traditionally used in the prevention and treatment of cancer. In an animal model, jasmine flower extract prevents the formation of tumors, possibly due to antioxidant constituents (56978).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of jasmine are due to phenolic and flavonoid compounds, including coumaroylquinic acid (110677).\nGastroprotective effects\nIn a mouse model of gastric ulcer induced by acid and ethanol, jasmine extracts alleviate ulceration by increasing prostaglandin E2 production and antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing lipid peroxidation, and reducing production of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis-related proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide. Some extracts and the hydroxytyrosol ingredient reduce ulcer scores and histopathological changes, restore the thickness of the gastric mucous layer, and improve body weight, food and water intake, and flatulence (110678).\nRelaxation effects\nThe smell of jasmine is thought to induce relaxation, slowing heart rate and improving mood (56975).\nSpasmolytic effects\nJasmine is used for abdominal pain due to dysentery. It has spasmolytic effects in guinea pig ileum (56962).\nVasodilatory effects\nIn isolated thoracic aorta, jasmine extract has a vasodilatory effect. The mechanism of action seems to involve the calcium channels (57041).\nWound-healing effects\nJasmine is traditionally used topically for wound healing. Animal research shows that application of jasmine extract or a mucoadhesive containing jasmine leaves accelerates wound-healing, likely by improving epithelialization and collagen formation and reducing inflammatory cell infiltration (56994, 102542)."

In an animal osteoarthritis model, Java tea extract protected against cartilage degradation and inflammation, possibly by altering the production of inflammatory cytokines in the cartilage (102764).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal research, extracts of the aerial parts of Java tea reduce blood glucose levels possibly by scavenging oxidants and increasing insulin-driven glucose uptake into muscle and adipose (115757).\nAntihyperuricemic effects\nIn vitro and animal studies suggest that Java tea or its constituents might reduce uric acid levels and improve pain associated with gout. An in vitro model of hyperuricemia shows that a Java tea aerial extract, and several of its constituents, promote excretion of uric acid. In an animal model of gouty arthritis, several constituents of Java tea appear to reduce joint swelling and improve pain (110428). In an animal model of hyperuricemic nephropathy, a Java tea extract reduces serum uric acid levels possibly regulating the gut microbiota and altering expression of the renal urate transporter and enzymes involved in hepatic urate synthesis (115754).\nAntimicrobial effects\nJava tea is stated to have antimicrobial effects (2, 18). Laboratory research also suggests that Java tea has anti-adhesive activity against some types of pathogenic bacteria (102763). Preliminary research in humans shows that drinking Java tea 4 times daily for 7 days inhibits the adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to bladder cells in vitro. The active constituents of the plant are thought to be polymethoxylated flavones (110429).\nCognitive effects\nIn animal research, a Java tea extract improves learning and spatial memory in a water maze test. Mechanisms of action may include reduced amyloid-beta-induced cytotoxicity, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and other compounds (115756).\nGastrointestinal effects\nJava tea is stated to have weak antispasmodic effects (2, 18).\nHepatic effects\nIn a rat model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a Java tea extract and its flavonoid fraction reduce weight gain, improve lipid metabolism, reduce hepatic steatosis, and reverse hepatic inflammation, possibly via antioxidant effects (115755).\nRenal effects\nAnimal research shows that Java tea has diuretic effects, possibly due to an interaction with adenosine A1 receptors in the kidneys (94851). In vitro, a water extract of Java tea reduces the size of human kidney stones, especially at high concentrations and in the presence of acid (110427). In a mouse model of hyperuricemic nephropathy, a Java tea extract improves renal function, reduces kidney damage and fibrosis, and lowers serum uric acid levels.

Chewing jequirity seeds or consuming seeds with cracked shells can cause toxicity and death (3499, 5608, 11473, 95220, 95221, 100257). Signs of toxicity may occur several hours after ingestion of the seeds, followed by the development of bloody diarrhea. More often, however, there can be a latent period of approximately 3-4 days after ingestion of the seeds prior to the development of toxic symptoms. Adverse events, including death, may occur up to 10-14 days after ingestion of the seeds (11473).\n\nEffective management of jequirity and abrin toxicity can include gastric lavage, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with hemoperfusion, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, as well as liver protection, hemostasis, and normalization of blood volume and electrolytes (100257).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Abrin, a protein found in the seeds of jequirity, prevents cellular protein synthesis and causes cell death (27036, 27037, 95220). There is no known antidote to these effects which can impact various cells in the body. Additionally, there is no method for enhancing the elimination of abrin. As such, patients seen within 4 hours of seed ingestion should be treated with usual decontamination methods including lavage, charcoal, and cathartics. In cases of diarrhea, the need for cathartics may be unnecessary. In some cases, intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisone have been administered (17, 27001, 27025, 27027, 27032).\n\nIn mice, the LD50 of an ethanolic jequirity leaf extract was more than 1300 mg/kg when given intraperitoneally (95222). An acute toxicity study in rats suggests that an aqueous extract of jequirity leaf is safe in doses up to 1000 mg/kg (27002) and a methanolic leaf extract is safe in doses up to 2000 mg/kg (95223). However, histological evidence from animal research shows that an aqueous jequirity leaf extract given orally at doses up to 1600 mg/kg can cause testicular degeneration, reduced sperm cell count, and scattered Sertoli cells (27034).\n\nSeed extracts have been shown to impact reproduction in animal models. A methanolic jequirity bean extract caused reversible disruption in the estrous cycle and completely blocked ovulation (27038). In males, jequirity bean extract reduced testicular weight, sperm count, and sperm motility and altered sperm morphology (27039, 27040, 27041). The effects on spermatogenesis are thought to be related to a decrease in the production and release of testosterone (27039).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of jequirity.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the jequirity plant are the leaves, root, and beans. The leaves of the jequirity plant contain the indole alkaloids abrine and precatorine, as well as the triterpene glycosides, abrusosides, and glycyrrhizin. The root contains hypaphorine, abrol, abrasine, precasine, precol, and abruquinones, among many other alkaloid and triterpenoid constituents. The beans, or seeds, contain many of these constituents, as well as albuminous proteins, the abrins (90900).\nAnthelmintic effects\nJequirity root and leaves are traditionally used to treat tapeworms. In vitro, stem and root extracts of jequirity have demonstrated anthelmintic activity against tapeworms (26897). The mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nAnti-allergy effects\nSome abruquinone constituents isolated from the root of jequirity possess potent antiallergic effects by inhibiting the activity of mast cells in vitro (3841). In animal research, jequirity leaf extract also inhibited the activity of mast cells (95222).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome abruquinone constituents isolated from the root of jequirity possess anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibiting antioxidant activity and the activity of neutrophils in vitro (3841). The anti-inflammatory effects of the abruquinones are possibly related to the inhibition of mast cell activity (3842). The leaf extract also appears to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal arthritis models (27002).\nAntibacterial effects\nJequirity leaves and roots are traditionally used for various infections. In vitro. the leaf and stem extracts have antimicrobial effects against various Gram positive bacteria (26898).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research shows that some abruquinone constituents isolated from the root of jequirity inhibit platelet aggregation (3841). The mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nAntitumor effects\nIn vitro, various jequirity leaf extracts have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells in a manner possibly related to antioxidant effects of the flavonoid constituents (95219). Peptide fractions of the toxic agglutinin compound, abrin, also appear to have anti-cancer effects in animal models, resulting in a reduction in solid tumor mass and volume as well as increased life span and decreased proliferation of various cancer cell lines (27012). The antiproliferative effects of these peptides may be due to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, following altered cell signalling (27007, 27008, 27009, 27010, 27011, 27013).\nAntiviral effects\nJequirity leaves and roots are traditionally used for various infections. In vitro, an abruquinone constituent of jequirity aerial parts has demonstrated antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (27015).\nHypoglycemic effects\nExtracts of jequirity have hypoglycemic effects in animal diabetic models. A methanolic leaf extract improved levels of both glucose and insulin, possibly by increasing the secretion of insulin (95223).\nImmunomodulating effects\nAnimal and in vitro studies show that peptides or inactivated lectins from jequirity have immunostimulating effects, including production of cytokines and activation of white blood cells and macrophages (27017, 27018, 27020, 27042, 27043, 27045).\nToxicity effects\nAbrin, isolated from jequirity seeds, is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis and a moderate inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Abrin has two chains (95220). The B chain binds to the cell surface, facilitating entry of the A chain (95220). The A chain is a type II ribosome inhibiting protein that binds to 28S rRNA when internalized into a cell and causes inactivation of protein synthesis and cell death (27036, 27037, 95220). When abrin damages endothelial cells, increased capillary permeability occurs, leading to fluid and protein leakage (27031). This can result in bloody diarrhea (95220). In vitro, aqueous extracts of the seeds have been shown to agglutinate human red blood corpuscles (6369)."

Lawsone, a component of jewelweed flowers and roots, may be a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, thus decreasing pain and swelling. For preventing dermatitis, lawsone is thought to act as a competitive inhibitor and bind the same site as urushiol oil, thus preventing a reaction (98702)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of jiaogulan are the aerial parts (94053). The leaves of jiaogulan contain a large number of triterpene saponins known as gypenosides (57052, 57053, 57054, 57055, 57057, 94053, 94056, 106650). There are over 189 different saponins in jiaogulan (94056). Many of the gypenosides are identical to the ginsenosides found in Panax ginseng. The amount of saponins in the leaves of jiaogulan is similar to the amount found in ginseng roots (6).\n\nOther components of jiaogulan include flavonoids, sterols, polysaccharides, polyphenols, phenolic acids, carotenoids, malonic acid, lutein, palmitic acid, linolenic acids, amino acids, and trace elements such as copper, iron, zinc, and others (94053, 94056, 106650).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an in vitro study, gypenoside XLIX extracted from jiaogulan inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-dependent (57055). Animal research shows that jiaogulan extract reduces inflammatory cytokines and improves recovery of motor function after lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation (106650). Additionally, in an animal model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, high dose jiaogulan extract reduces inflammatory cytokines via the inhibition of inflammatory pathways (115477).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, gypenosides extracted from jiaogulan decreased cancer cell viability, arrested the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in human colon cancer cells, and induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells (57051, 57052, 57057, 94056). Also in vitro, various saponins found in the aerial parts of jiaogulan have exhibited cytotoxic activities against human leukemia cells, prostate, stomach, and hepatocellular cancer cell lines. Antiproliferative effects have also been shown in vitro against human lung cancer, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells (57060, 94056).\n\nIn mice, gypenosides have reduced the size of oral solid tumors and suppressed advanced sarcoma tumor growth, as well as increased survival and enhanced immune responses. Gypenosides have enhanced the effects of 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer, and may inhibit tumorigenesis (94056).\n\nIn exploratory clinical studies, jiaogulan has been associated with reduced cancer relapse and metastasis rates, as well as reduced mortality over 5 years when compared to control. In breast cancer, jiaogulan may increase natural killer cell activity. It may also improve immune function in patients that recently received chemotherapy (94056).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that jiaogulan extract might lower blood glucose levels by increasing insulin release (94054, 94055). However, evidence from clinical research shows that jiaogulan does not increase insulin levels in humans (94054). Instead, jiaogulan is thought to reduce blood glucose levels by increasing insulin sensitivity through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity (94054, 95519) and by decreasing glucose absorption through inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity and down-regulation of glucose transporter 2 expression (100962).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests the gypenosides in jiaogulan have antilipid peroxidation activity and protect vascular endothelial cells and their membranes from oxidative damage (9349).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is some evidence that the gypenoside constituents have several cardiovascular effects and may prevent the development of atherosclerosis and slow the aging process (9349). In animal research, jiaogulan seems to lower blood pressure, heart rate, blood vessel resistance, increase coronary blood flow, and inhibit platelet aggregation (7071).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nIn vitro, an extract of jiaogulan activated liver X receptors, which play an important role in cholesterol homeostasis by serving as regulatory sensors of cholesterol levels in tissues (57053). There is also preliminary evidence a combination of jiaogulan with Nelumbo nucifera (Lotus flower or seed) and Crataegus cuneata (Hawthorn) might have both a cholesterol- and triglyceride-lowering effect. It is unclear whether these effects are due to an interaction among these agents or if one of the agents is primarily responsible (9348).\nCoagulation effects\nAn in vitro study of human blood samples found that a water extract of jiaogulan significantly inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate and compound agonists, accelerated disaggregation, and inhibited experimental thrombosis (7071). However, in another in vitro study, another extract from jiaogulan Makino contained a platelet aggregation factor (57059). Some research suggests that hot water extracts of jiaogulan contain a factor that induces platelet aggregation, but the effect occurs only with washed platelets and is not observed in platelet-rich plasma. This suggests the factor is unlikely to cause thrombosis in vivo (9350).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn mice with diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, jiaogulan extract altered the gut microbiota by reducing some opportunist pathogens at high doses and increasing some potential probiotics at low doses (115477).\nHepatic effects\nIn mice with diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, jiaogulan extract reduces levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and improves markers of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (115477).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal research, jiaogulan may protect against cerebral ischemic damage (7071).\nWeight loss effects\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that regulates energy balance. Its activation leads to increased fat oxidation and glucose uptake. In addition, activation of AMPK inhibits both fat and cholesterol synthesis. In vitro and in vivo research shows that two specific saponins found in jiaogulan, damulin A and B, increase phosphorylation of AMPK, which then stimulates beta-oxidation (94058).\n\nA study in mice given low, medium, and high dose oral jiaogulan polysaccharides suggests that jiaogulan may prevent weight gain and obesity. Researchers also found increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and greater gut microbiota quantity and diversity (110700)."

            "Overview": "Jimson weed grows throughout the world and has been recognized as an hallucinogenic plant for centuries (57098). It has reportedly been used by the native peoples of North America (57071), as a treatment for asthma in India (57071), and as a home remedy in colonial times in West Virginia (57151).",
            "Warnings": "Children and adolescents may use jimson weed recreationally, but it is unsafe. Parents should be cautioned about the online availability of jimson weed for purchase (57081). There are numerous reports of severe toxicity, including death, from use of jimson weed. Jimson weed has also led to death after accidental consumption when it was confused for other edible plants (18, 57083, 57081, 109503).",
            "Safety": "UNSAFE when the leaf or seed are used orally or via inhalation (13, 5622). Although all parts of the jimson weed plant contain toxic belladonna alkaloids, the seeds contain the highest quantity (5623). Ingestion of jimson weed can cause acute anticholinergic poisoning and death (17, 5621, 5622). The lethal dose for adults is 15-100 grams of jimson weed leaf or 15-25 grams of the seeds (equivalent to 100 mg atropine) (18).\nCHILDREN: UNSAFE when the seed or leaf are used orally or via inhalation. Although all parts of the jimson weed plant contain toxic belladonna alkaloids, the seeds contain the highest quantity (5623). Ingestion of jimson weed can cause acute anticholinergic poisoning and death (17, 5621, 5622). Children are more sensitive to the toxic effects of jimson weed than adults, and the lethal dose is lower (18). The lethal dose in children is less than 1.5-10 grams of jimson weed leaf or less than 1.5-2.5 grams of the seeds (equivalent to 10 mg or less of atropine) (57144).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: UNSAFE when used orally (2); avoid using.",

Topically, direct exposure of the eye to jimson weed alkaloids can also cause mydriasis (57061).\nless\nOther\nOrally, jimson weed can block muscarinic cholinergic neurons and cause anticholinergic side effects. Larger amounts of jimson weed intake can also lead to toxicity and anticholinergic syndrome. Central anticholinergic symptoms, which are dose-dependent, include muscle tremor and rigidity, leg cramps, hallucinations, slurred speech, psychosis, agitated delirium, seizures, coma, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms include dilated pupils, blurry vision, dry mouth, flushed skin, tachycardia, arrhythmias, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and difficulty urinating (636, 57067, 57075, 57077, 57078, 57084, 57085, 57098, 57103, 57108)(57116, 57120, 57140, 57148, 57151, 57152, 57156, 113142). There are also numerous reports of death after jimson weed ingestion (5622, 57067, 57086, 57088, 109503). The lethal dose of jimson weed for adults is 15-100 grams of leaf or 15-25 grams of the seeds (equivalent to 100 mg atropine) (18). Jimson weed toxicity seems to occur 1-12 hours after ingestion (57084, 57092, 109502).\n\nChildren and adolescents are more susceptible to jimson weed toxicity.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOverdose with jimson weed generally presents as anticholinergic toxicity from the alkaloid constituents, such as atropine and scopolamine. This may include dry mouth, dry eyes, dilated pupils, blurred vision, tachycardia, altered mental status, fever, and abdominal pain (109502, 109503, 113142). Onset of symptoms can occur rapidly, within 1-12 hours after consumption (57084, 57092, 109502, 113142). Overdoses are also common from accidental ingestions, where jimson weed is mistaken for edible plants or a contaminant within other harvested plants (109502, 109503, 113142). Sometimes anticholinergic jimson weed intoxication is confused with sympathomimetic bath salts or cathinone intoxication. A common differentiating symptom is the absence of sweating with jimson weed intoxication, as opposed to hyper-perspiration with sympathomimetic intoxication (95453).\n\nDeaths from accidental overdose with jimson weed have been reported (18, 109503). The lethal dose of jimson weed for adults is 15-100 grams of leaf or 15-25 grams of the seeds (equivalent to 100 mg atropine) (18). The lethal dose in children is less than 1.5-10 grams of jimson weed leaf or less than 1.5-2.5 grams of the seeds (equivalent to 10 mg or less of atropine) (57144).\nTreatment\nTreatment of jimson weed overdose should mirror treatment of anticholinergic toxicity and may include physostigmine, neostigmine, activated charcoal, and/or intravenous fluids. Gastric lavage has also been used (57153, 57065, 57066, 57073, 57077, 57065, 57098, 57099, 57111, 57151)(57154, 57156, 109502). Benzodiazepines have also been used (57082, 113142); however, in one observational study, there was no difference in hospital stay or condition severity when benzodiazepines were given with or without physostigmine (57082).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nAfter oral administration, atropine and scopolamine, constituents of jimson weed, distribute into the blood (57099). After chronic oral use, atropine and scopolamine can be detected in hair (95451).\nExcretion\nThe active constituents of jimson weed, including scopolamine and atropine, appear to be primarily renally eliminated (5622, 57129, 57146).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of jimson weed are the leaf and seed. Jimson weed contains 0.1-0.6% alkaloids including atropine, l-hyoscyamine and l-scopolamine which are responsible for anticholinergic activity and toxicity (2, 57079, 57092, 57123, 57146, 57147).\nAntibacterial effects\nJimson weed has been historically used for bacterial respiratory infections. In vitro research shows that methanol extracts of the aerial parts of Jimson weed have a dose-dependent antibacterial activity against gram positive bacteria (57090).\nAnticholinergic effects\nJimson weed has been historically used for asthma via inhalation. Its bronchodilatory effects when smoked can be explained by the anticholinergic effects of the alkaloids atropine, l-hyoscyamine and l-scopolamine (57079, 57092, 57123, 57132, 57146, 57147). The toxic effects of jimson weed can also be explained by the anticholinergic effects of these constituents (57067, 57075, 57077, 57078).\nSleep effects\nAnimal research suggests that jimson weed extract may improve sleep duration and sleep latency via elevations in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and/or activity at opioid receptors. Animal research in mice shows that administering jimson weed seed, calyx, or petal extract, 16% to 21%, 50-100 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection as a single dose improves sleep duration and sleep latency by 26% to 120% and 26% to 57%, respectively, when compared with control (109501)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Job's tears are the root and the seeds. The root contains benzoxazinoid compounds (15361).The seed consists of 8.5% water, 17.6% protein, 52% starch, and 2.3% ash (15362). The seed also contains about 3% to 7% oil, which consists of about 1.6% phytosterols such as sitosterol, sitosterone, campersterol, and camperstanol (15362, 15364, 15372). The seed oils include palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic fatty acids (15371). The seeds also contain 3 to 5 times the amount of B and E vitamins found in rice (111468).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn overweight or obese young adults, replacing refined grains with powdered Job's tears seeds, 60 grams daily at any meal for 6 weeks, decreases the percentage body fat, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline, but does not change body weight. Job's tears seed also lowers the inflammatory markers, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6 and 10, and the marker of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (111468).\nAntidiabetic effects\nJob's tears seeds have hypoglycemic activity in animal models, which is thought to be due to the coixan A, B, and C constituents 15363). In a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), extracts of Job's tears seeds improve hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance (106512). Preliminary research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a porridge prepared from dried Job's tears seeds mixed with yogurt once daily for 12 weeks reduces plasma glycated albumin levels when compared with baseline (111465).\nAntihypertensive effects\nResearch in hypertensive animals shows that adding 12% or 24% dehulled Job's tears seeds to the diet for 12 weeks limits further increases in blood pressure, when compared with a regular diet. In overweight or obese humans, eating 60 grams of dehulled Job's tears seeds daily for 6 weeks decreases systolic blood pressure, especially in those with high pressures at baseline. Possible mechanisms of an antihypertensive effect include reduction in levels of endothelin-1, a mediator of vasoconstriction and salt and water retention, and increased magnesium levels, stimulating prostacyclin and nitric oxide production to cause vasodilation (111220).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPowdered seed extract of Job's tears is thought to have activity against cutaneous warts. It's theorized that it stimulates cytotoxic activity against viral diseases (15362). Job's tears seed extract seems to have biostatic in vitro activity against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. Components of Job's tears seed appear to activate macrophages against Toxoplasma gondii (15362). Some evidence shows that taking Job's tears seed in tablet form can increase cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell activity in animal models (15363).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSome extracts of Job's tears seed have anticancer activity. In animal and vitro studies, a methanolic extract of Job's tears seed inhibited lung cancer cell growth through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; however, a water extract did not have this activity (15365). A methanolic extract of Job's tears seed also inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, but not COX-1 expression, in lung cancer cells in animal and in vitro studies (15367). In an animal model of colon cancer, hulled Job's tears seed extract also inhibited COX-2 expression, but did not prevent the formation of colon tumors (15369). A lipid extracted from Job's tears seed also inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (15371).\nAntioxidant effects\nSeveral constituents of Job's tears have antioxidant activity, including syringic acid, ferulic acid, syringaresinol, 4-ketopinoresinol, and the lignan mayuenolide (15368).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research shows that ingesting hulled Job's tears seed seems to alter the culture counts of enteric micro-organisms. Animals ingesting Job's tears appear to have higher cultures of lactic acid-producing bacteria and fewer enteric bacteria (15363). Human research in healthy adult males shows that consuming cooked Job's tears seeds, 106 grams daily for 7 days, increases intestinal Faecalibacterium abundance and alters the ratio of the different types of peripheral lymphocytes (natural killer, memory, helper and regulatory T-cells) (111467).\nHepatic effects\nResearch using fatty liver cell cultures or animal models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), shows that dehulled Job's tears seeds, and extracts from them, reduce NAFLD progression by attenuating hepatic fat deposition, improving liver function, insulin resistance and steatosis, and reducing inflammation. Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels, adipose leptin levels, and plasma fasting glucose levels are lowered. Downregulation of fatty acid synthesis and upregulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation occurs, along with decreased levels of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins 1-beta and 6. Increased plasma and adipose adiponectin levels contribute to the improved insulin sensitivity and reduced lipid accumulation in the liver (106512, 111469).\nImmunologic activity\nThere is interest in Job's tears for allergies due to suspected anti-inflammatory activity. Job's tears root contains benzoxazinoid compounds, some of which might inhibit the release of histamine from mast cells in vitro (15361). Additionally, in animal models, Job's tears hulled seed extract decreases antigen-stimulated production of IgE antibodies. A methanolic extract appears to have greater activity than a water extract (15366).\nLipid effects\nIn a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), extracts of Job's tears seeds attenuate increases in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (15368, 106512). Preliminary research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a porridge prepared from dried Job's tears seeds mixed with yogurt once daily for 12 weeks reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels, and increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with baseline (111465). Other research in healthy individuals shows that consuming 40-55 grams Job's tears seed powder as the sole carbohydrate source for breakfast, daily for 12 weeks, reduces total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides levels when compared with baseline (111466). Constituents of Job's tears that may contribute to lipid lowering effects include polyphenols, phytosterols, and fiber, which includes 32% slowly digestible or resistant starch (111466).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in Job's tears for weight loss. In animal models of obesity, a Job's tears seed extract reduces food intake, body weight, cholesterol levels, adipose tissue mass, and leptin in animals fed a high fat diet (15370). Job's tears oil also appears to reduce LDL cholesterol, insulin, and leptin in animal models (15372)."

            "Overview": "Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is a shrub native to deserts in Arizona, California and Mexico (57172, 57185) and is also found in some arid African countries (57177). The oil (or liquid wax) in jojoba seeds contains extremely long (C36-C46) straight chain fatty acids in the form of wax esters, as opposed to triglycerides (57171). It is this structure that allows it to be easily refined for use in cosmetics and as a carrier oil for fragrances. Jojoba meal, remaining after oil extraction, is rich in protein (57172). In Japan, jojoba oil (wax) is used as a food additive (57179). The use of jojoba oil in various applications is limited by its high price (57180). Jojoba meal can be used as an animal feedstuff (57188).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used topically (6).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally because it contains 14% erucic acid, which can cause myocardial fibrosis (6); avoid using.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used topically for hygienic uses (6).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally (6).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nSide effects of jojoba are mainly limited to contact dermatitis and gastrointestinal concerns in animals fed large amounts of jojoba meal.\nDermatologic\nContact dermatitis to jojoba oil has been described in case reports (57197, 57186).\nless\nEndocrine\nLevels of plasma growth hormone and thyroxine increased and levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor-I and triiodothyronine decreased in animals fed diets of 4% jojoba meal (57195).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIn animals fed jojoba oil for four weeks (2.2-9% of diet), necropsy and histopathological evaluation revealed an apparent distension of the small intestine and marked intestinal changes characterized by massive vacuolization and lipid deposition in the enterocytes, accompanied by distension of the villi and an increased cell turnover of small intestinal cells (57189).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIn broiler breeding females fed jojoba meal, the size of the eggs laid were smaller and the overall production rate was lower than birds not fed jojoba (57164). Ovary and oviduct weights were also reduced. In female rats fed defatted jojoba meal or pure simmondsin, the number of corpora lutea on gestation day 16 as reduced, and this was thought to be due to decreased food intake in this group (57199). Fetal and placental weights were also reduced in these groups.\nless\nHematologic\nIn animals fed jojoba oil for four weeks (2.2-9% of diet), there was a dose related increase in white blood cell count (57189).\nless",

One low quality clinical study shows that applying a clay facial mask containing jojoba oil, 15 minutes 2-3 times weekly for 6 weeks, might reduce the number of whiteheads, blackheads, papules, and pustules in patients with acne (95436). The results of this study are questionable due to the lack of a control group.\nAlzheimer disease. One small clinical trial shows that massaging the hand with jojoba oil does not improve emotions, aggression, or cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease (57178).\nMosquito repellent. One small clinical study shows that topical application of a repellant containing jojoba oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, and vitamin E provides complete protection against mosquito bites for at least 3 hours. Some protection remains for up to 6 hours, but to a lesser degree than is seen with a repellant containing deet 15% (13081).

            "Overdose": "Booth described the isolation of a 'toxic factor' from jojoba meal in 1974 (57190) and the removal of toxic compounds was later developed (57187). Treatment of jojoba meal and seed without seed coat with hexane and a 7:3 isopropanol-water mixture has been used to remove 86% of total phenolic compounds and 100% of simmondsins originally present; the resulting product caused no deaths in experimental animals. Removal of toxic compounds does allow jojoba meal to be an alternative feedstuff for animals in regions were jojoba is produced (57188). Lactobacilli have also been used to detoxify jojoba meal (57192, 57194).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "In an animal model, absorption of jojoba 14C-labelled liquid wax was investigated (57191). Intragastric administration resulted in the majority of the wax being excreted. A small amount was absorbed, and distributed in internal organs, epididymal fat, and body lipids.\n\n\nThe final step in liquid wax biosynthesis in the jojoba seed is catalyzed by fatty-acyl-coenzyme A (CoA): fatty alcohol acyltransferase (57171). Beta-Ketoacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase activity, involved in the formation of very long chain fatty acids, such as found in jojoba waxes, is present in developing jojoba embryos (57196).\n\n\nThe appetite suppressing effects of jojoba seed meal is reduced when the meal is treated with 1N NaOH at 20oC resulting in the destruction of simmondsin (57175). End products include d-glucose and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetonitrile and intermediates included isosimmondsin and a simmondsin lactone derivative.\n\n\nBoiling of jojoba meal has been suggested to inactivate protease inhibitors and the denaturation of proteins, resulting in increased digestibility (57172).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "Anti-inflammatory effects\nHabashy examined the anti-inflammatory effects of jojoba liquid wax in several animal and in vitro models (57177). Jojoba liquid wax reduced carrageenin-induced rat paw edema and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in inflammatory exudates. In a chick embryo chroioallantoic membrane model, jojoba liquid wax caused a reduction in granulation tissue formation. In rats, croton oil induced ear edema was reduced. In this model, there was also a reduction in neutrophil infiltration (decreased myeloperoxidase activity) and histopathological changes. Jojoba liquid wax reduced nitric oxide levels and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release in a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation rat air pouch model.\n\n\nAnti-insect effects\nTopical application of the prepupae of Rhynchophorus ferrugineous with one of three dose-levels (0.1, 0.005 or 0.001mcg per insect) of jojoba oil decreased daily O2 consumption and CO2 release of early and late pupae (57173). This suggests jojoba oil may have use a general insecticide.\n\n\nAppetite suppressant effects\nThe appetite suppressing effects of jojoba seed meal is reduced when the meal is treated with 1N NaOH at 20oC, resulting in the destruction of simmondsin (57175).\n\n\nCholesterol reducing effects\nThe effects of jojoba oil on blood cholesterol levels have been investigated in an animal model (57193).\n\n\nConstituents\nIn jojoba meal, the major proteins are albumins (79%) and globulins (21%) (57172). Residual meal analysis resulted in crude protein 25.24%; ether extract 14.73%; crude fiber 10.07%; ash 4.72, nitrogen-free extract 45.25, and trypsin inhibitor factors 11,197TIU/g (57188). A trypsin-inhibitory substance, able to inhibit the enzymic activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, but not the protease from Aspergillus saotoi, has been identified in commercially processed jojoba seed meal and the albumin fraction of seed proteins (57183). It is unclear whether consumption of jojoba seed meal by humans would inhibit trypsin activity in the intestine.\n\nIn jojoba meal, 1-oleoyl-3-lysophosphatidylcholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidylcholine (57176), the pinnitol alpha-D-galactosides 5-O-(alpha-D-galactopyranosyl)-3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol or 5-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-D-pinitol and 2-O-(alpha-D-galactopyranosyl)-3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol or 2-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-D-pinitol (57170, 57200), and simmondsin [2-(cyanomethylene)-3 hydroxy 4,5 dimethoxy cyclohexyl beta-D-glucoside] and simmondsin ferulates (57167, 57168) were identified. Simmondsin, 4-demethylsimmondsin, 5-demethylsimmondsin and 4,5-didemethylsimmondsin were isolated from jojoba seed meal (57174).\n\n\nWith fermentation, five strains of simmondsin-degrading, lactic-acid-producing bacteria were isolated from jojoba meal (57169).\n\n\nSeed analysis resulted in crude protein 14.03%; ether extract 48.89%; crude fiber 10.03%; ash 1.59, nitrogen-free extract 25.46, and trypsin inhibitor factors 13.747TIU/g (57188).\n\n\nThe jojoba plant synthesizes liquid wax (57171). Wax levels may represent up to 70% (by weight) of the oil present in jojoba seeds (57166, 57181, 57165). The main constituents in jojoba wax are the wax esters, eicosenyl octadecenoate (C20:1-C18:1), eicosenyl eicosenoate (C20:1-C20:1), docosenyl eicosenoate (C22:1-C20:1), eicosenyl docosenoate (C20:1-C22:1) and tetracosenyl eiosenoate (C24:1-C20:1) (57179). A wax ester hydrolase is active in developing jojoba cotyledons (57182).\n\n\nJojoba seed is a source of xyloglucan oligosaccharides, which may be a convenient source of individual oligosaccharides (57198).\n\n\nAminopeptidase activity has been determined in germinated jojoba cotyledon extracts (57184). This protein is thought to be involved in the degradation of globulin reserve proteins during cotyledon senescence."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of juniper.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nJuniper berries and leaves contain flavonoids including apigenin, rutin, and luteolin (12230, 57203, 57215, 94060). Juniper berry oil is mostly composed of monoterpenes including alpha-pinene (51.4%), myrcene (8.3%), sabinene (5.8%), limonene (5.1%), and beta-pinene (5.0%) (94060). The seeds and fruit also contain glycolic acid, formic acid, malic acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid, and camphor (94060). Various extracts of juniper made from dried stems showed differing amounts of constituents including flavonoids, volatile oil, and coumarins (94060). Juniper extracts also contain flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and neolignan glycosides (12230, 57208, 94060).\nAbortifacient effects\nAbortions have been induced in cattle fed juniper (57211). Isocrupressic acid has been identified as an active abortifacient compound in juniper.\nAnalgesic effects\nJuniper seems to have some antinociceptive activity and likely acts both peripherally and centrally. In animal research, a methanolic extract of juniper exhibited a dose dependent effect on the writhing response (94060). Additionally, in mice, intravenous administration of a lyophilized aqueous extract of juniper produced an analgesic response of 178% as measured by thermal stimuli (57219).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nJuniper fruit has demonstrated inhibition of prostaglandin and platelet activating factor exocytosis in vitro (94060). Oral administration of an ethanolic extract of juniper reduced carrageenan-induced rat paw edema by 60% compared to 45% for indomethacin (13466).\nAntibacterial effects\nJuniper berry has demonstrated antibacterial effects in vitro (4, 10939, 103755). Juniper berries showed activity against Escerichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hafnia alvei. A hexane extract of juniper leaf appears to have more antibacterial activity compared to ethanol, methanol, and chloroform extracts (94060). Volatile oils of Juniperus communis have higher activity against S. aureus when compared with other juniper species (103755).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animals, juniper berry seems to reduce blood glucose levels and decrease polydipsia. It appears to work primarily by increasing peripheral glucose uptake (10580, 14907, 94060).\nAntifungal effects\nJuniper berry oil has demonstrated antifungal effects in vitro (4, 10939).Oil from the aerial parts of juniper has shown some activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Rhizopus stolonifer. This activity is thought to be due to the monoterpenes found in juniper (94060).\nAntimalarial effects\nEssential oil from juniper has shown some activity against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro (94060).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that juniper can block the oxidation process and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (94060).\nCardiac effects\nIntravenous administration of a lyophilized aqueous extract of juniper, 25 mg/kg body weight, to normotensive rats produced an initial transient rise in arterial pressure followed by a reduction of 27% (57219). The mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nDiuretic effects\nThe diuretic action of juniper has been attributed to terpinen-4-ol (57207). However, some animal research suggests that the diuretic effect is partly due to the essential oil and partly to hydrophilic constituents (57218). The magnitude of juniper's diuretic effects is unclear, as some animal research shows that aqueous juniper extract is no more effective than water at increasing urine volume while other animal research shows significant effects only at higher concentrations (57218, 57219).\nHepatoprotective effects\nJuniper has demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in animal research. Compared with rats receiving placebo, rats receiving juniper and then exposed to CCl4 had less pronounced increases in serum SGPT, SGOT, ALP, and bilirubin. Ethanol and aqueous extracts of juniper may be more effective (94060). The mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that juniper methanolic extract and oil can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, respectively, in diabetic rats (94060). The mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nNeurologic effects\nA methanolic extract of juniper has been shown to reduce reserpine induced catalepsy compared with reserpine alone in rats. (94060). Juniper has also shown some neuroprotective activity in a chlorpromazine induced Parkinson's model in rats (94060). The mechanism of these effects is unclear."
