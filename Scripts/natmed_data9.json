The seeds of Hawaiian baby woodrose contain a compound called lysergic acid amide. Plants containing this compound have been traditionally used in shamanistic rituals in South America (103857, 103861). Traditionally, the seeds have been used for purported analgesic, diaphoretic, and hallucinogenic effects.",

The number of seeds needed to produce adverse effects differs for each individual.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dizziness, fatigue, hallucinations, hypertension, mydriasis, paranoia, sweating, tachycardia.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, approximately four homogenized Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds have been reported to cause temporary blood pressure elevation (103857). In one 18-year-old male, consuming 15 Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds resulted in tachycardia and hypertension. The patient also used cannabis, but symptoms were thought to be related to Hawaiian baby woodrose (103858). The number of seeds needed to produce adverse effects differs for each individual. Additionally, the alkaloid and lysergic acid amide contents vary from batch to batch (103857).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds can cause sweating (5301).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, four homogenized Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds have been reported to cause nausea and vomiting (103857). The number of seeds needed to produce adverse effects differs for each individual. Additionally, the alkaloid and lysergic acid amide contents vary from batch to batch (103857).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, four homogenized Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds have been reported to cause fatigue lasting for 2 hours and tremor of the hands lasting for about 9 hours in one person (103857). Weakness, vertigo, and heaviness in the legs have also been reported (103857). The seeds have also been reported to cause auditory hallucinations and altered visual perception (5301, 103857, 103860). The number of seeds needed to produce adverse effects differs for each individual. Additionally, the alkaloid and lysergic acid amide contents vary from batch to batch (103857). Lysergic acid amide 2-5 mg is enough to cause hallucinations, with effects lasting 4-8 hours (5301, 5304, 97867).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds can cause blurred vision, dilated pupils, and involuntary, rapid, rhythmic movement of eyeballs (5301, 103857).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, four homogenized Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds has been reported to cause difficulty expressing thoughts, fits of laughter, and paranoia in one person (103857). The seed has also been reported to cause mood elevation and anxiety (103857, 103860). In an 18-year-old male, ingestion of 15 seeds resulted in erratic and bizarre behavior accompanying suicidal and homicidal ideation and depression. The patient also used cannabis, but symptoms were thought to be related to Hawaiian baby woodrose (103858). In one case report of a 29-year-old male, consuming an unknown quantity of soaked Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds and smoking cannabis resulted in severe agitation leading to a jump from a fourth-floor window and death (97867). In a 17-year-old female, ingestion of 6 seeds initially resulted in a euphoric and energetic mood, with increased socializing and school performance. The patient then developed problems with concentration, thinking, and sleep, with nightmares, anxiety, suspiciousness, and crying, resulting in hospital admission and treatment for psychosis with aripiprazole 10 mg daily and lorazepam as needed.

Lysergic acid amide was found in the serum 30-40 minutes after ingestion of the seeds. In at least one person, lysergic acid amide levels continued to increase approximately 90 minutes after intake (103861).\nMetabolism\nFollowing ingestion of Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, 2-oxo 3-hydroxy metabolites of lysergamide and ergonovine were found in the blood and urine (97867).\nExcretion\nFollowing ingestion of Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, lysergic acid amide, ergonovine, and D-lysergic acid alpha-hydroxyethylamide were found in urine (97867, 103861). The time to detection of these compounds in the urine is variable. Lysergic acid amide was detectable within one hour in one person and after 7.25 hours in another (103861). Levels are no longer detectable by 48 hours (103861).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Hawaiian baby woodrose is the seed. The seeds of Hawaiian baby woodrose contain lysergic acid amide (ergine), ergonovine, and isoergine (isolysergic acid amide) (5301, 5304, 103860). Other constituents include lysergol, elymoclavine, setoclavine, and chanoclavine (103860). Lysergic acid amide and its isomers are the dominant constituents at approximately 83%, followed by ergonovine at 10% to 17% (103860). Lysergic acid amide is considered to be the most active constituent (103860). However, isolysergic acid and lysergol are also active (103857). The total ergot alkaloids in seeds can vary by at least 8.6-fold and the content of lysergic acid amide can range from trace amounts up to16 mcg per mg of seeds (103857, 103860, 109536).\nPsychiatric effects\nThe lysergic acid amide constituent of Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds affects the dopamine D2 receptor. It also seems to be a partial agonist or antagonist of adrenergic and serotonergic receptors (103737, 103860). The lysergic acid amide in Hawaiian baby woodrose is thought to have similar hallucinogenic effects to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) due to its activity at the 5-HT2 receptor. Drugs that are 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, such as cyproheptadine and atypical antipsychotics, might block the effects of Hawaiian baby woodrose (17, 103737, 103860)."

It is unclear if oral hawthorn is beneficial in patients with angina.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with angina taking chronic beta-adrenergic receptor blockers or ACE inhibitor therapy shows that taking a hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifada) extract 100 mg orally three times daily for four weeks improves angina and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and reduces nitroglycerin intake when compared with placebo (19242). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with unstable angina shows that taking hawthorn 10 grams and hu zang 15 grams orally daily for 4 weeks does not reduce the frequency of angina pectoris attacks when compared with control. However, taking hawthorn and hu zang improved some subjective symptom scores and quality of life scores (109610).\nless\nAnxiety. Oral hawthorn has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with mild to moderate generalized anxiety shows that taking a specific product (Sympathyl, not available in the US) containing hawthorn, magnesium, and California poppy for 90 days modestly improves anxiety scores when compared with placebo (12583). Also, a clinical study in adults with adjustment disorder and anxious mood shows that hawthorn, in combination with black horehound, passion flower, valerian, kola nut, and guarana, modestly improves anxiety scores when compared with placebo (6250). It is unclear if these effects are due to hawthorn, other ingredients, or the combination. Another small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination of herbal extracts containing hawthorn, passionflower, ballota, and valerian root daily for 14 days reduces subjective anxiety and objective sympathetic and autonomic nervous system activation in response to a psychosocial stressor when compared with placebo (111222). It is unclear if these effects are due to hawthorn, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nArrhythmia.

Although there has been interest in using oral hawthorn for atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of arrhythmia for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there has been interest in using oral hawthorn for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of arrhythmia for this condition.\nCognitive function. Oral hawthorn has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn a preliminary clinical trial, a single dose of 25 drops of a combination product of D-camphor and hawthorn berry extract (Korodin) was superior to placebo for increasing cognitive performance in elderly female patients as measured by visuomotor speed and information processing capacity. The active treatment group showed an improvement in attentional and mental performance (19240, 91504).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). The evidence on the effects of oral hawthorn in patients with CHF is conflicting. Although some older research suggests it may be beneficial, more recent, larger studies suggest it may actually increase the risk for complications.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of hawthorn extract in heart failure patients. Several clinical studies show that taking specific hawthorn leaf and flower extracts (LI 132, Faros 300, Lichtwer Pharma; WS 1442, Crataegutt forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals; or HeartCare, Nature's Way) 240-600 mg daily improves ejection fraction and exercise tolerance, reduces subjective symptoms, and decreases the risk of death in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage II heart failure. In these studies, the maximum effect was usually seen after 6-12 weeks of treatment (8279, 8280, 11449, 19221, 19223, 19225, 19226, 19227, 19228). Another clinical trial shows that hawthorn extract (WS 1442, Crataegutt forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals or HeartCare, Nature's Way) 1800 mg daily, combined with diuretic therapy, improves exercise tolerance and reduces subjective symptoms in NYHA stage III heart failure. In this study, maximum effect was usually seen after 16 weeks of treatment (8281). In another trial, patients with NYHA II heart failure taking either hawthorn (LI 132, Faros) 300 mg three times daily or captopril 12.5 mg three times daily experienced similar improvements in cardiac performance and symptoms (19230).\n\nHowever, other clinical research suggests no benefit and possible harm with hawthorn. A large-scale clinical trial (SPICE) in patients with NYHA stage II or III heart failure shows that taking specific hawthorn extracts (WS 1442, Crataegutt forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals; HeartCare, Nature's Way) 900 mg daily for 24 months, in combination with conventional treatment, does not decrease hospitalization due to progressive heart failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac death (17203). Another clinical trial in patients with NYHA stage II or III heart failure shows that taking these same specific hawthorn extracts at the same dose for up to 6 months does not slow the progression of heart failure when compared with placebo (19222). In a retrospective analysis of this study, it was shown that heart failure progression was significantly increased in patients taking hawthorn when compared with placebo.

Signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension such as dizziness, blurry vision, and falls also seem to be reduced when compared with baseline (39614, 39617). A meta-analysis of 4 studies shows that giving single doses of 20-25 drops of the same combination product increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (103620). However, the studies have methodologic problems and, while 2 were conducted in females with orthostatic hypotension, the others involved health young adults or normotensive elderly subjects.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of hawthorn.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of hawthorn are the leaves, berries, flowers, and roots. Major pharmacologically active components are believed to be flavonoids, particularly the oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) such as procyanidin B2, procyanidin clusters (DP 4, 5, 6), catechin, and epicatechin (54659, 54662, 54665). Other known constituents include caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, hyperoside, myricitrin, oleanolic acid, O-methyoxyphenethylamine, phenylethylamine, quercitrin, rutin, tocopherols, tyramine, ursolic avid, vitamin C, isovitexin, vitexin, vitexin-2-O-rhamnoside, and vitexin rhamnoside (19241, 54657, 54662).\nAntineoplastic effects\nHawthorn may exhibit antineoplastic activity and collagen stabilizing actions. Two triterpenes, uvaol and ursolic acid, were isolated from hawthorn and suggested to be responsible for cytotoxicity against human and murine cancer cell lines (54641). Triterpene-enriched fractions of hawthorn extract have demonstrated almost complete inhibition of cultured larynx cancer cell growth and stronger in vitro activity than 6-mercaptopurine solution(54695). The exact mechanism of action is not well understood.\nAntioxidant effects\nFree radical properties have been demonstrated in vivo (54682, 54699), and may depend on the phenol (54681) or flavonoid content of the extract.\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that hawthorn extract can inhibit ADP- and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time (95528, 95529, 95530, 95531). The extracts inhibit synthesis of thromboxane A2, a stimulator of platelet aggregation. The active constituents are thought to include flavonoids and sesquiterpenes (95529, 95531). However, the effect of hawthorn on platelet aggregation in humans is conflicting. One observational study shows that taking hawthorn shortly before undergoing cardiovascular surgery is associated with a 9% higher incidence of postoperative bleeding compared with never consuming hawthorn (95527). However, clinical research shows that taking a specific preparation of dried hawthorn leaves and flowers (Crataesor, Soria Natural Lab) 800 mg three times daily for 15 days does not affect platelet aggregation or levels of thromboxane B2, the metabolite of thromboxane A2, in healthy humans (54664). These conflicting results may be due to the use of different hawthorn species, extracts, and doses.\nCardiovascular effects\nHawthorn preparations have been traditionally used for cardiovascular conditions (98380). Hawthorn acts on the myocardium by increasing force of contraction and lengthening the refractory period, increasing coronary blood flow and cardiac output, and reducing oxygen consumption (10144, 11450, 12595). Hawthorn's cardiotrophic properties are attributed to increased membrane permeability for calcium (11450), and phosphodiesterase inhibition, which increases intracellular cAMP. Increased cAMP leads to increased coronary blood flow, vasodilation, and positive inotropic effects (11450, 12595). Hawthorn seems to have hypotensive and vasodilatory activity. In a human study, hawthorn extract had beneficial effects on endothelial function (104689). In animals, it seems to cause peripheral vasodilation and to induce endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation. The proantocyanidin constituents seem to be responsible for this effect (12595).\n\nThere is also interest in using hawthorn for reducing arrhythmic events (12595). One theory is that hawthorn might reduce arrhythmias by reducing adrenergic stimulation. In vitro, hawthorn leaf extract had a dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect on cardiac muscle cells. This effect is thought to be due to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade similar to propranolol (98380). However, this effect has not been confirmed in humans. Another theory is that hawthorn might block potassium channels, prolong action potential repolarization, and prolong the QT interval similarly to class III antiarrhythmic agents. Preliminary studies in animal models support this theory. However, a small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that a single dose of hawthorn 160 mg orally has no effect on electrocardiographic measures such as QT, PR and QRS intervals (98381).\n\nFinally, some preliminary research in humans and animals suggests hawthorn might lower serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and/or triglycerides (12595, 104689). In an animal model, hawthorn seems to lower accumulation of lipids in the liver and aorta. The fruit extract may lower cholesterol by increasing bile acid excretion, reducing cholesterol synthesis by the liver, and enhancing LDL-receptor activity. Hawthorn also seems to have antioxidant activity (12595).\nDermatologic effects\nSkin aging is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) A and B rays from sunlight. There is interest in using polyphenols from hawthorn to protect from UVB radiation damage to slow skin aging. Preliminary research in human skin cell lines and in animal models shows that hawthorn polyphenol extract increases activity of antioxidant enzymes and reverses oxidative stress caused by UVB irradiation. Hawthorn extract also seems to reduce epidermal thickening and increase collagen production, which might help to reduce wrinkles and skin damage from UVB radiation (98379)."

However, there is no available evidence showing that eating hazelnut, specifically, reduces the risk of CHD (8478, 13299). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 ounces of nuts, such as hazelnuts, per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD.

Other toxic alkaloids include N-methyl coniine, conhydrine, and pseudoconhydrine (96877). The quantity of poisonous alkaloids in hemlock decreases as the plant and fruit ripens and reaches maturity (6338). Hemlock is most toxic during early stages of growth in the spring (6338, 6339). Green fruit contains larger amounts of toxic alkaloids than mature fruit and seeds (6338). The constituent coniine predominates in the plant during sunny, dry weather, while coniceine predominates during early growth periods. During cloudy and rainy weather, the constituents coniine and coniceine are produced in equal amounts (6339).\nToxic effects\nThe toxic alkaloid constituents of hemlock act at the neuromuscular junction of the autonomic ganglia (6341), stimulating and then paralyzing nicotinic receptors (6340). Larger doses of the alkaloids produce narcotic-like depressant activity (6340). The early symptoms of toxicity, due to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation, include vomiting, diaphoresis, tachypnea, salivation, and urination. Later effects, caused by blocking of nicotinic receptors, include bradycardia, tremor, visual disturbance, neuromuscular blockade, paralysis, apnea, convulsions, and coma (110410)."

It is the same species (Cannabis sativa) as the cannabis plant, but the two plants are differentiated by their delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, defines hemp as containing less than 0.3% THC dry weight, whereas cannabis contains more than 0.3% THC (99608, 101124, 101141, 101142).",

Since CBD is an ingredient in the drug Epidiolex, it cannot be legally included in foods or dietary supplements (99608, 101141). However, this has been disputed and enforcement has been lacking; dietary supplements and foods containing CBD are prevalent in the marketplace (89911, 99608, 106638).\n\nThe 2018 Farm Bill also permitted domestic hemp production, resulting in the establishment of the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program in March 2021.

The validity of this study is limited due to its exploratory nature and lack of control for voluntary dietary changes.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral hemp seed is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nA clinical study in 18 older adults with osteoarthritis undergoing in-hospital rehabilitation following knee or hip arthroplasty shows that consuming pasta enriched with hemp seed flour for 6 weeks improves pain scores by about 3 points, compared with only 1 point in those consuming a regular pasta control (107320). A small clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a hemp seed oil supplement 826 mg daily in combination with ginger extract and terpenes such as beta-caryophyllene and myrcene for 45 days reduces patient-reported pain and severity and improves functionality when compared to hemp seed oil alone (115742). However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear; additionally, it is unclear if these results are due to hemp seed oil, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPain (chronic).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals and humans, most studies suggest that consuming hemp seed oil increases levels of fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid in the blood (101125, 101126, 101130, 101131, 101147).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of hemp are the flowers, leaves and the seed, including the whole seed, the oil, and the protein (99608, 101124, 101141, 101142). Depending on the variety, hemp seed oil contains 16.0% to 23.0% alpha-linolenic acid, 47.0% to 57.3% linoleic acid, 9.0% to 19.9% oleic acid, 2.6% to 4.4% gamma-linolenic, and 2% stearidonic acid (16791, 101123, 101125, 101126, 101132, 101142, 101144, 101149, 101152). Unsaponifiable matter contains beta-sitosterol, campesterol, phytol, cycloartenol, and gamma-tocopherol (101142). The oil also contains very low levels (<5ppm) of as many as 30 cannabinoids, including cannabiripsol, cannabitriols, cannabigerols, cannabidiols, cannabielsoin, cannabinols, tetrahydrocannabinols, cannabichromenes, and cannabicitran (101122). The seeds also contain flavonoids, flavonols, and other polyphenols including lignanamides, caffeoyltyramine, and cannabisins (101121, 101149).\n\nHemp seed is a good quality source of protein with lysine as the rate-limiting amino acid (101143, 101148). Hemp seed protein is primarily edestin and albumin (101129). Selective breeding of hemp has nearly removed delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the seed (101137).\n\nHemp flower and leaves, and hemp oil, contain phytocannabinoids, especially cannabidiol, as well as terpenoids (101124).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nHemp is traditionally used for arthritis and joint pain. In vitro, hemp seed oil induces the production of an anti-rheumatoid factor, as well as the apoptosis of a rheumatoid arthritis synovial cell line (101133).\nAnti-cancer effects\nHemp is traditionally used for cancer. In vitro, hemp seed oil extract induced apoptosis of cancer cell lines; however, hemp seed and hemp flour extracts did not (101149).\nAnti-hypertensive effects\nIn a hypertensive animal model, hemp seed protein hydrolysate reduced systolic blood pressure. The mechanism of action is possibly related to a suppression of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities as shown. Hemp seed protein isolate itself also had antihypertensive effects but was not as effective as the hydrolysate. There was no effect of either protein isolate on blood pressure in normotensive animals (101136). These protein products also had antioxidant effects in the hypertensive model (101135).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHemp seed is traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory effects. In various cell lines in vitro, hemp seed extract or seed protein hydrolysate fractions decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, and/or other mediators, possibly by inhibiting specific cellular pathways (101128, 101148).\nGastrointestinal effects\nHemp seed is traditionally used for constipation. In an animal model, hemp seed increases water content of feces and increases the number of bowel movements. Hemp seed was found to increase mucosal secretion from colonic tissue in vitro in a manner involving one or more electrolyte channels or exchangers (101134).\nHepatic effects\nThere is interest in using hemp seed products for preventing fatty liver disease. Animal research shows that consumption of defatted hemp seed protein attenuates liver enzyme elevations and markers of steatosis when used instead of, or in addition to, a high-fat diet (104477).\nHypolipidemic effects\nBased on the presence of polyunsaturated omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in hemp seed oil, it is of interest for reducing levels of plasma cholesterol. However, human research in children with hypercholesterolemia and in healthy adults, as well as most animal research, does not support the cholesterol-lowering effects of hemp seed oil (16791, 101126, 101144, 101147, 103805, 110285). However, a small clinical trial in obese adults suggests that taking hemp oil extract 60 mg daily may produce small improvements in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. After 6 weeks of treatment, HDL increased by approximately 3 mg/dL, compared with a decrease of approximately 2 mg/dL in the placebo group (103805). Also, there may be peptide sections of the edestin and albumin proteins that have hypolipidemic effects. In vitro, some hemp seed peptides inhibited the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and increased the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol into cells by increasing expression of the LDL receptors (101129).\nMetabolic effects\nAn acute feeding study in healthy patients suggests that consuming hemp protein 20-40 grams is similar to soy protein 20-40 grams for reducing postprandial glucose and insulin response when compared with a carbohydrate control (104478)."

PAs are most concentrated in the plant roots, but may be found in all plant parts. PAs, particularly unsaturated PAs, can cause hepatotoxicity. Cyclic diesters such as retrorsine and senecionine are the most hepatotoxic. Liver toxicity may result from PA-enhanced oxidative stress, but the exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown. Single doses of 10-20 mg PAs or chronic ingestion of amounts less than 10 mcg can cause veno-occlusive disease. PAs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to toxic dehydroalkaloids and pyrroles. Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital seem to enhance toxicity (12841, 12860). Pyrroles are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates. Some researchers speculate that early administration of N-acetylcysteine might reduce toxicity (11988).\n\nMetabolism is also affected by pregnane X receptor induction of CYP3A4. Genetic or drug induced variation in CYP3A4 or pregnane X receptor activity can affect the degree of PA toxicity by increasing or decreasing its metabolism (12841, 12842). Hepatotoxic PAs are also toxic to the lungs. In animals, pneumotoxicity occurs as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Hepatotoxic PAs are carcinogenic and mutagenic. There are sufficient amounts of hepatotoxic PAs in herbal products to cause toxicity (12841, 12842)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of henbane are the dried leaves, flowering tops, and dried seeds (18, 100916). The primary constituents of the leaves, fruits, and roots responsible for the activity of henbane are the tropane alkaloids, including hyoscyamine, hyoscine, and scopolamine (100916, 100917). With storage, hyoscyamine, which is the levorotatory isomer of atropine, converts to racemic atropine (18, 100917). There are also flavonol glycosides present in henbane, including quercetin, rutin, and kaempferol. An extract of the seeds contains cleomiscosin B, venkatasin, daturalactone-4, and balanophonin (100916).\nAnticholinergic effects\nThe tropane alkaloids, including hyoscyamine, hyoscine, and scopolamine, competitively inhibit acetylcholine, causing anticholinergic and parasympatholytic effects. The inhibition of acetylcholine occurs at muscarinic receptors but not at the nicotinic receptors on ganglia and motor endplates (2, 18). The peripheral anticholinergic effects on the autonomic nervous system result in smooth muscle relaxation, particularly in the GI tract. Henbane also has central nervous system (CNS) effects including sedation (2, 18).\nAntiparkinsonian effects\nHenbane is traditionally used for the treatment of Parkinson disease. In a mouse model of Parkinson disease, an aqueous methanol extract of henbane seeds reduces striatal dopamine loss and motor disabilities. These improvements are likely due to the anticholinergic effects of henbane. The extract also inhibits monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity, reducing the breakdown of dopamine. Inhibition of the generation of hydroxyl radicals in mitochondria may also contribute to the antiparkinsonian effects of henbane (100916)."

PPD is not a compound naturally found in henna and is added to enhance the effects of henna as a dye, especially \"black\" henna. However, allergic reactions to pure henna have been confirmed with skin patch testing in a small number of patients (100830, 100836, 100842).\nUNSAFE when used orally.

Ingestion of henna might also exacerbate diseases such as ulcerative colitis, although evidence is limited. A 45-year-old female with ulcerative colitis in remission reportedly experienced 10 days of chemical colitis with symptoms of severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, starting one week after ingesting one liter of diluted henna powder (100854).

In one case report, a 69-year-old man accidentally ingested 2 teaspoons of henna leaves and developed severe symptoms of lawsone poisoning, including hemolysis, renal failure, and cardiac ischemia. It is likely that this man had G6PD deficiency, but this was not confirmed by testing (100852). At least one case of hemolytic anemia following oral use of an unknown quantity of henna has been reported in an adult without G6PD deficiency. After taking henna for 2 days, an 85-year-old man developed abdominal pain and severe sequelae of hemolytic anemia including jaundice, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, and cardiac arrest.

In a case report, a 34-year-old male with a history of chronic drinking presented with acute kidney injury after ingesting 700 mL of boiled henna leaves daily for 3 days. The damage resolved after 7 days of supportive care (100841). It was unclear if the acute kidney injury was due to the henna itself or to a contaminant.

It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy male cyclists show that taking a specific form of hesperidin (Cardiose, HealthTech BioActives) has some benefit on athletic performance. One study shows that taking this form of hesperidin 500 mg once, five hours prior to exercise, improves average power, maximum speed, and total energy when compared with placebo. However, it does not improve peak power, time to peak power, or total oxygen consumption (102312). Taking this form of hesperidin 500 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves the highest average power output that can be maintained for one hour and the maximal power during an incremental test when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the aerobic or anaerobic ventilatory thresholds, oxygen use, or the times to peak power or maximum speed when compared with placebo (105277).\nless\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for CP/CPPS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this condition. There is research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin. See Diosmin for more information.\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Oral hesperidin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific combination product containing hesperidin methyl chalcone 150 mg, butcher's broom root extract 150 mg, and ascorbic acid 100 mg (Cyclo 3 Fort) usually for 1-3 months may decrease pain, heaviness, cramps, and paresthesia in patients with CVI (37483).\n\nThere is also research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for CVI. See Diosmin for more information.\nless\nCognitive function. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for improving cognitive function, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this condition.\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for patients undergoing CABG surgery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this purpose. There is research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin. See Diosmin for more information.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for diabetes.\nClinical research in adults with diabetes shows that taking hesperidin (Swanson Health Products) 500 mg once daily for 6 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure and the mean arterial blood pressure by about 3% and 2.5%, respectively, when compared with placebo. Although this improvement is statistically significant, it is unlikely to be considered clinically significant. Also, hesperidin does not modify levels of fasting blood glucose or measures of insulin resistance (98697, 105292). A prospective observational study in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes has found that taking a specific product (Flebotrofine, AMNOL Chimica Biologica) containing hesperidin for 3 months is not associated with improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline. Other ingredients in this product included L-arginine, troxerutin, diosmin, black currant extract, and gotu kola extract (108151).\n\nThere is also research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for diabetes. See Diosmin for more information.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and metabolic syndrome on oral antidiabetic therapy shows that taking hesperidin 1 gram daily improves diabetic neuropathy as measured by the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) and a physical exam performed by a neurologist when compared with antidiabetic therapy alone. The improvements in measures of diabetic neuropathy were greater when hesperidin was taken with diosmin 1 gram daily compared with either supplement alone or antidiabetic therapy alone, suggesting a synergistic effect (112797).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for diabetic retinopathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this condition.\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for preventing muscle soreness due to exercise.\nA very small clinical study in sedentary young adults shows that taking hesperidin methyl chalcone 500 mg daily for 3 days prior to intense exercise improves physical performance and postural balance and relieves impaired strength and muscle soreness upon palpation but does not relieve muscle soreness during active movement when compared with placebo (112801).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Oral hesperidin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with acute hemorrhoidal crisis shows that taking a specific supplement (Triade H, Omikron Italia Srl) containing hesperidin, diosmin, and troxerutin daily for 43 days results in significantly less pain, bleeding, anal itching, and medication use when compared with placebo (93885). This product was given as one sachet of powdered diosmin 300 mg, troxerutin 300 mg, hesperidin 300 mg, and vitamin C 12 mg mixed in water orally three times daily for 3 days, then two sachets daily for 2 days, then one sachet daily for seven days, followed by one tablet containing hesperidin 100 mg, diosmin 300 mg, and troxerutin 300 mg daily for one month (93885).\n\nThere is also research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for hemorrhoids. See Diosmin for more information.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight males with or without hypertension shows that taking hesperidin 136 mg or drinking 250 mL of orange juice containing hesperidin 136 mg twice daily for 4 weeks lowers diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure by around 5 mmHg when compared with placebo (94543). However, a meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that taking hesperidin supplements 400-800 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo in healthy and obese individuals with or without hypertension (102315). Due to the mixed populations evaluated in this research, the effect of hesperidin in patients with diagnosed hypertension is unclear.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for hypertriglyceridemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking glucosyl hesperidin, a soluble hesperidin derivative, 500 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly lowers triglyceride levels when compared with baseline in patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia, but not in those without hypertriglyceridemia. However, glucosyl hesperidin did not lower cholesterol levels; a lower dose of 100 mg daily had no effect on either outcome (105290). Clinical research in a similar population shows that taking glucosyl hesperidin 500 mg daily for 24 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by up to 34% from baseline and modestly reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54800). The validity of the findings in these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nLymphedema. Oral hesperidin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in females with lymphedema due to breast cancer surgery shows that taking three capsules of a specific combination product (Cyclo 3 Fort), which contains hesperidin methyl chalcone 150 mg, butcher's broom root extract 150 mg, and ascorbic acid 100 mg per capsule, three times daily orally for 90 days reduces swelling in the upper arm and forearm and improves mobility and heaviness when compared with placebo (37494).\n\nThere is also research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for lymphedema. See Diosmin for more information.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking hesperidin (Shaanxi Yuantai Biological Technology Co., Ltd) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks increases the number of patients who no longer have defined metabolic syndrome by almost two-fold when compared with placebo. There were also modest reductions in fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure, as well as the total number of patients with abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting blood sugar. However, there were no differences in levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, or waist circumference (105288). In another preliminary clinical study using the same product, there were modest reductions in systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels when compared with no treatment. However, there were no effects on other measures of metabolic syndrome or the overall number of patients with defined metabolic syndrome. This study also shows that when hesperidin is taken in combination with flaxseed 15 grams twice daily, serum concentrations of triglycerides and glucose, as well as systolic blood pressure, were modestly improved when compared with control. The prevalence of individuals with defined metabolic syndrome at the end of treatment was reduced by approximately 77%, which was significant when compared with the control group (105276). Another small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy on oral antidiabetic therapy shows that taking hesperidin 1 gram daily reduces body mass index, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but not systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or HDL cholesterol when compared with control. These effects are enhanced when hesperidin is combined with diosmin 1 gram daily (112797).\nless\nMinor bleeding. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for minor bleeding, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this purpose. There is research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin. See Diosmin for more information.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for NAFLD; the available evidence is conflicting.\nA small clinical trial in adults with NAFLD shows that taking hesperidin 1 gram daily for 12 weeks along with lifestyle modification improves hepatic steatosis as measured by transient elastography when compared with placebo and lifestyle modification. Taking hesperidin also modestly improves total cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. However, there were no effects on liver fibrosis or levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting blood glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (102313). Other preliminary clinical research using the same treatment protocol shows that although there were modest reductions in ALT, there was no effect on liver steatosis, liver fibrosis, or other metabolic measures. When used in combination with flaxseed 30 grams daily, levels of fasting blood glucose and a measure of insulin resistance were modestly improved (105275). These studies may have been too small to detect differences in most endpoints.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for RA.\nA small clinical study shows that drinking a 100 mL beverage containing alpha-glucosyl hesperidin 3 grams daily orally for 12 weeks might improve symptoms of RA when compared with placebo (54850).\nless\nVaricose veins. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for varicose veins, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this condition. There is research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for this purpose. See Diosmin for more information.\nVenous leg ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral hesperidin for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hesperidin for this condition. There is research evaluating the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction, which contains small amounts of hesperidin, for this purpose. See Diosmin for more information.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). It is unclear if oral hesperidin is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA large clinical study in unvaccinated outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 shows that taking hesperidin 1000 mg at bedtime for 14 days after symptom onset does not reduce the proportion of subjects with the most common symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, and anosmia), number of symptoms after 14 days, or duration of individual symptoms when compared with placebo (112800). However, the study was limited by significant attrition.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate hesperidin for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with hesperidin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSome research suggests that pure hesperidin has a bioavailability of less than 25% (53374). Micronization can increase bioavailability of hesperidin, increasing absorption by 40% compared with non-micronized hesperidin formulations. Additionally, the bioavailability of the 2S-hesperidin enantiomer is greater than a mixture of both hesperidin stereoisomers due to the greater formation of hesperidin catabolites in the 2S-enantiomer formulation (112799). In one pharmacokinetic study, the Cmax for orally administered hesperidin was 825.78 ng/mL (2731.8 nmol/L) and the mean AUC was 4846.20 ng*h/mL (54819). Following the ingestion of blood orange juice in human subjects, the Cmax for hesperidin was 43.4 ng/mL and 79.8 ng/mL after 150 mL and 300 mL intake, respectively (54825). Human and animal research suggest that the absorption of hesperidin takes place in the large intestine, with concentrations evident in the plasma within 20 minutes and with a Tmax ranging from 4-6 hours (54819, 54825, 54863, 54867).\nMetabolism\nAnimal research shows that hesperidin undergoes rapid and extensive phase II metabolism (54842). Hesperidin is hydrolyzed by gut microflora in the colon into its aglycone (hesperetin) (54976, 54867, 54888) and then conjugated mainly into glucuronides (54763, 54867, 105278). The major urinary metabolite is 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl hydracrylic acid (54772). Other hesperidin metabolites found in human plasma and urine include hesperetin-3'-sulfate, hesperetin-3'-glucuronide, hesperetin-7-sulfate, and hesperetin-7-glucuronide (54867, 105277, 105278).\nExcretion\nHesperidin is minimally excreted in urine, and research shows that people can be low, intermediate, or high urinary hesperidin excreters with the relative cumulative urinary excretion ranging from 0.6% to 8% (54819, 54867, 112799).One study shows that a micronized formulation of 2S-hesperidin has greater bioavailability, overall hesperidin metabolite and catabolite excretion in urine, and relative urinary hesperidin excretion compared with non-micronized and stereoisomeric formulations of hesperidin (112799). Some animal research shows that the urinary excretion of hesperidin metabolites was higher in rats administered glucosyl hesperidin than those receiving pure hesperidin (54806). Animal research shows that hesperidin is also excreted by non-renal routes (54842). Some clinical research suggests that elderly patients may have reduced excretion of hesperidin, whereas sex, weight and contraceptive pill use do not affect hesperidin excretion (54867). In one human study, the elimination half-life of orally administered hesperidin was around 3 hours (54819).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHesperidin is one of over 4000 flavonoids found in plants (4919, 4959, 5006). It is in a class of flavonoids primarily derived from citrus fruits and is known as a citrus bioflavonoid. It is closely related to other citrus bioflavonoids such as quercetin, rutin, and diosmin (4861, 4900, 4919, 4956).\nAnalgesic effects\nThe analgesic effect of hesperidin may be explained by peripheral rather than central mechanisms (4861, 4900, 4919, 4956) and may involve opioid receptors (54841).\nAnti-aging effects\nAnimal research suggests that hesperidin may have anti-aging effects. Hesperidin was found to suppress NF-kappaB activation through signal transduction pathways, NIK/IKK, ERK, p38, and JNK as well as suppress the translocation of Trx/Ref-1 indicating beneficial redox activity (54814).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal and human research show that hesperidin has anti-inflammatory effects in the body, reducing levels of some inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory proteins, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (98697, 105275, 112798). One meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults shows that taking hesperidin 88-500 mg daily as supplements or orange juice reduces CRP, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-4 but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha when compared with control (112798). However, another meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies shows that hesperidin does not seem to affect CRP, interleukin (IL)-6, or E-selectin levels (102314).\n\nOther research suggests that hesperidin's modest anti-inflammatory activity seems to help restore normal capillary permeability and have beneficial vascular effects. Hesperidin inhibits phosphodiesterase and increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which causes decreased production of inflammatory prostaglandins E2 and F2 and thromboxane B2. Hesperidin has also reduced the generation of free radicals and inhibited tumor growth in laboratory research (4861, 4900, 4919, 4956).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that hesperidin may have anticancer effects via its ability to reduce the generation of free radicals and inhibit tumor growth (4861, 4900, 4919, 4956, 54771, 54779).\nAntidiabetic effects\nHesperidin might be helpful in diabetes. In animal research, hesperidin reduced blood glucose, in part, by increasing hepatic glycolysis and glycogen concentration or by lowering hepatic gluconeogenesis (54784, 54913).\nAntihypertensive effects\nHuman research shows that there is a linear trend between hesperidin intake and decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Decreases in SBP were directly related to decreases in the expression of pentraxin-3 (PTX3) (105278). Animal research shows that glucosyl hesperidin enhances endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to acetylcholine and reduces oxidative stress by inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase expression in the vasculature, thereby improving hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (54851).\nAntioxidant effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults shows that taking hesperidin 88-500 mg daily as a supplement or in orange juice reduces malondialdehyde but does not change total antioxidant content, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, or catalase levels when compared with control (112798).\nAntiplatelet effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that hesperidin inhibits platelet aggregation by interfering with cyclooxygenase-1 activity and PLC-gamma2 phosphorylation (54822).\nAntiviral effects\nSome in vitro research shows that glucosyl hesperidin prevents influenza a virus replication via inhibition of viral sialidase (54892).\nBone effects\nClinical research shows that taking calcium 500 mg orally with hesperidin 500 mg daily for 50 days appears to improve retention of calcium in the bones by 5.5% from baseline. However, since taking calcium alone was not a comparator for this study, the effect of hesperidin is on calcium retention is unclear (94541). Some animal research suggests that hesperidin inhibits bone loss (54818, 54843) by a mechanism similar to that of statin drugs (54818). In an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, hesperidin seemed to maintain the bone mineral density and concentration of calcium in the femur (54766).\nCardiovascular effects\nHesperidin is most often used for vascular conditions such as hemorrhoids and varicose veins in combination with other citrus bioflavonoids,. These bioflavonoids seems to work by improving venous tone, reducing stasis, restoring normal capillary permeability, and improving lymphatic drainage. Hesperidin might improve venous tone and reduce stasis by improving vasculature response to adrenergic stimulation. Hesperidin's anti-inflammatory effects seem to help restore normal capillary permeability. Hesperidin inhibits phosphodiesterase and increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which causes decreased production of inflammatory prostaglandins E2 and F2 and thromboxane B2 (4861, 4900, 4919, 4956).\n\nAdditionally, hesperidin seems to improve endothelial function (37478, 94545). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking hesperidin 500 mg orally daily for 3 weeks increases flow-mediated dilation which is related to improvement in endothelial function in patients with metabolic syndrome. Additionally, serum inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein were reduced (94545). In vitro research also shows that hesperidin decreases inflammation and lipid accumulation in the endothelium via modulation of gene expression on leukocytes, suggesting that it may have anti-atherogenic and cardioprotective effects (94542).\n\nSome in vitro research suggests that hesperidin inhibits platelet aggregation by interfering with cyclooxygenase-1 activity and PLC-gamma2 phosphorylation (54822).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nHesperidin is of interest for improving athletic performance. Taking hesperidin 500 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces body fat and increases muscle mass in male cyclists (105279). A clinical study in amateur cyclists shows that taking 2S-hesperidin (Cardiose, HealthTech BioActives) 500 mg daily for 8 weeks might improve athletic performance by improving acid-base status as shown by increased bicarbonate anion, actual base excess, standard bicarbonate, and decreased lactate during aerobic exercise and recovery. Additionally, 2S-hespiridin intake decreases lactate during aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise, and recovery. This suggests that 2S-hesperidin could lead to a greater contribution of fatty acid oxidation at lower exercise intensities and improved recovery after intense exercise (112803). Furthermore, 2S-hesperidin intake by amateur cyclists during the off season prevents decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen, which could help prevent a loss of performance during subsequent high-intensity exercise following lower levels of training (112802).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn vitro research shows that hesperidin and neohesperidin protect against hydrogen peroxide-induced neurotoxicity (54844). In an animal model, hesperidin offered a protective effect against 3-nitropropionic acid (a model to study Huntington disease) attenuating behavioral alterations, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial enzymes complex dysfunction; hesperidin may act through a nitric oxide mechanism (54903).\nRadioprotective effects\nSome animal research shows that hesperidin exerts radioprotective effects against gamma irradiation via free radical scavenging (54804, 54859)."

Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts, including a specific Hibiscus sabdariffa leaf extract (Green Chem), have also been safely used in doses of up to 1000 mg daily for up to 90 days (17415, 54989, 93805, 93809, 105307).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx powder has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 2 grams three times daily for 4 weeks by adolescents aged 12-18 years (93816).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Hibiscus sabdariffa is thought to be a menstrual stimulant, and might have abortifacient effects (19).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Animal research found that administering large doses of Hibiscus sabdariffa during lactation decreases food and water intake during pregnancy and delays puberty in offspring (93810); however, this has not been assessed in humans.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Hibiscus sabdariffa is generally well tolerated.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking a specific Hibiscus sabdariffa leaf extract (Green Chem) 1 gram daily has been associated with reports of transient gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal distention, flatulence, and epigastric pain in one clinical trial. However, the overall rate of these adverse effects was similar to placebo (17415). Taking Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract 6 grams daily has been associated with single cases of nausea in one clinical trial (55000). Taking Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx powder 6 grams daily has been associated with reports of mild and transient constipation in one clinical trial (93816). Taking 0.5-1 liters of tea daily, made by steeping 10-15 grams of dried Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces, has been associated with one report of stomach pain in one clinical trial (101733).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, taking Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract 6 grams daily has been associated with one report of dysuria in one clinical trial (55000).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, taking Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract 3 grams daily has been associated with one report of tremor and headache in one clinical trial (55000).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, taking Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx extract 3 grams daily has been associated with one report of tinnitus in one clinical trial (55000).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nTaking 0.5-1 liters of tea daily, made by steeping 10, 15, or 20 grams of dried Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces, has been associated with two reports of dyspnea in one clinical trial.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Oral Hibiscus sabdariffa seems to lower blood pressure by a small amount in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.\nMost research shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea daily can modestly lower blood pressure in patients with pre-hypertension or mild hypertension after 2-6 weeks of treatment (16894, 54985, 54995, 90159, 93817, 101730, 108867). In addition, some research shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea daily can modestly lower blood pressure in patients with either untreated or insufficiently treated mild to moderate hypertension (54989, 93815, 101733, 108867). These studies have used tea made from 1.25-10 grams or 150 mg/kg, brewed in 150 mL to 500 mL of water and taken one to three times daily for 2-6 weeks (16894, 54985, 54989, 54995, 90159, 93815, 93817, 101730, 101733, 108867). The dose has been increased to 15 or 20 grams, brewed in 1000 mL for daily consumption for 2-3 weeks if needed (101733, 108867). In this population, research shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea or infusions is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and as effective as captopril 25 mg twice daily for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure (54989, 93815). Pooled analyses of results from clinical research shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea or taking Hibiscus sabdariffa extract lowers systolic blood pressure by 5-8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 4 mmHg in patients with or without mild hypertension (93817, 105304). The clinical relevance of these results is uncertain due to the small size and low quality of the included studies. Some researchers suggest that there is insufficient reliable evidence to determine if the effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa are clinically relevant (17114).\n\nTaking Hibiscus sabdariffa in combination with other ingredients has also showed beneficial effects on blood pressure in clinical research. In one study, a specific product containing Hibiscus sabdariffa extract in combination with olive leaf extract (NW Roselle) for 8 weeks was found to be as effective as captopril 25 mg twice daily for reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (105302). In another study, a specific product (MetabolAid, Monteloeder S.L.) providing Hibiscus sabdariffa and lemon verbena extracts for 12 weeks reduced systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure. However, these effects were limited to daytime ambulatory readings (105303).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Hibiscus sabdariffa for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa for this condition.\nConstipation. Although there has been interest in using oral Hibiscus sabdariffa for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Hibiscus sabdariffa is beneficial for diabetes.\nPooled analyses of results from clinical research show that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa lowers fasting blood glucose levels by approximately 4 mg/dL (105304, 105305). However, only one low-quality study included in one of these analyses examined the effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa on fasting blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (105305). Therefore, any benefit specific to this population is unclear.\nless\nDry mouth. Topical Hibiscus sabdariffa has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with dry mouth shows that taking a specific mucoadhesive tablet (Aqualief, Helsinn Healthcare SA), containing a combination of Hibiscus sabdariffa and carnosine, 400 mg three times daily after meals for 6 days increases saliva production and improves symptoms of dry mouth when compared to baseline. While saliva production was also increased in patients taking placebo, the increase was 3-fold greater with the combination product, and significant improvements in dry mouth symptoms were lacking in the placebo group (103288). It is unclear if these findings are due to Hibiscus sabdariffa, carnosine, or the combination.\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if oral Hibiscus sabdariffa is beneficial for dry skin.\nA crossover clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa 100 mL twice daily for 6 months improves skin moisture but does not improve skin surface water loss or sebum secretion when compared to baseline (112426). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant or apply to patients with dry skin.\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral Hibiscus sabdariffa is beneficial for dyslipidemia.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea or taking Hibiscus sabdariffa extract can decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, in patients with metabolic disorders (54997, 54999). These studies used Hibiscus sabdariffa 2 grams in 240 mL boiling water, steeping for 20-30 minutes, twice daily and Hibiscus sabdariffa extract 100 mg daily, each for 4 weeks (54997, 54999). Clinical research also shows that taking powdered dried Hibiscus sabdariffa 6 grams daily reduces LDL cholesterol by approximately 8% in obese adolescents with dyslipidemia (93816). Additionally, two meta-analyses shows that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa extract modestly reduces LDL cholesterol levels (105305, 105306).\n\nHowever, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa extract does not improve cholesterol or triglyceride levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia (17415, 55000). Two pooled analyses of clinical data show that Hibiscus sabdariffa does not improve total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo, a change in diet, or black tea in patients with hyperlipidemia, metabolic disorders, or obesity (93805, 105304). The differing conclusions of these trials and meta-analyses are related to their inclusion and exclusion criteria with respect to age and populations of focus.\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there has been interest in using oral Hibiscus sabdariffa for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral Hibiscus sabdariffa may be beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nIn adults with metabolic syndrome, a small clinical trial shows that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa powder 500 mg daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels by 5% and 15%, respectively, when compared with baseline. These changes were significant when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose or insulin levels, cholesterol levels, or body mass index (105307). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa extract 100 mg daily for one month modestly reduces fasting glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with baseline. When taken in combination with recommendations to follow the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) diet, triglyceride levels and blood pressure were also modestly reduced (54999).\nless\nObesity. Oral Hibiscus sabdariffa has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTwo small clinical trials in overweight and obese females show that taking a combination product (MetabolAid, Monteloeder SL) containing Hibiscus sabdariffa and lemon verbena extracts as 500 mg per capsule daily for 2 months modestly increases weight loss when compared with placebo (97290, 101731). This combination also reduces hunger and increases satiety, and has small to moderate beneficial effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, heart rate, and blood pressure (97290). The effects in obese individuals seem to be less than those seen in overweight individuals, with no overall change in abdominal circumference or percent body fat in obese individuals (101731). A meta-analysis of these two studies and several others in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking Hibiscus sabdariffa in combination with other ingredients daily for 6-12 weeks modestly improves body mass index, weight, and body fat percentage when compared with control (112427). However, the validity of these results is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Additionally, it is unknown if these effects are due to Hibiscus sabdariffa, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral Hibiscus sabdariffa is beneficial for UTIs.\nPopulation research in patients with urinary catheters living in long-term care facilities has found that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa tea is associated with a 36% lower risk of UTIs when compared with not drinking tea (93807).\n\nSome small clinical studies that have evaluated the use of Hibiscus sabdariffa in combination with other ingredients suggest that they might reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTIs in females with recurrent UTIs. One study used a product containing Hibiscus sabdariffa 200 mg, D-mannose 1000 mg, and Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115 (1 billion colony forming units) daily for 15 days each month for 6 months (101734); the other study used a specific product (Monurelle Plus, Zambon Italia) containing Hibiscus sabdariffa 100 mg, xyloglucan 100 mg, gelatin 50 mg, and propolis 100 mg twice daily for 14 days (101735). Also, a small observational study in patients with an uncomplicated UTI has found that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Acidif plus) containing Hibiscus sabdariffa extract 100 mg, boswellia gummy dry extract 100 mg, and L-methionine 400 mg daily for 7 days is associated with reduced UTI symptoms and reduced bacteriuria when compared with taking an unreported dose of fosfomycin for two days (103783). However, due to the poor quality of these studies, the magnitude of benefit is unclear. Also, it is unknown whether these effects are due to Hibiscus sabdariffa, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using topical Hibiscus sabdariffa for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate Hibiscus sabdariffa for these uses.",

A specific combination product (NW Roselle) containing Hibiscus sabdariffa and olive leaf extracts was standardized to delphinidin-3-sambubioside found in Hibiscus sabdariffa and oleuropein found in the olive leaf (105302). A specific combination product (Metabolaid, Monteloeder SL) containing lemon verbena and Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts 500 mg per capsule was standardized to contain 3.5% anthocyanins and 15% verbascoside (97290, 101731, 105303).",

Maximum levels were obtained about 1.5 hours after ingestion (54990, 101732).\nExcretion\nIn healthy individuals, Hibiscus sabdariffa resulted in urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-sambubioside, delphinidin-3-sambubioside, and total anthocyanins with maximum excretion occurring 1.5-2 hours after ingestion (54990).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Hibiscus sabdariffa is the flower, calyx or sepal, leaves, stems, and seeds (93805, 93806, 93808, 101732). Sepal extracts contain significant amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. The sepal also contains the highest concentration of water-soluble antioxidants (15375). The seed and leaf of Hibiscus sabdariffa contain significant amounts of vitamin E; the stem and sepal contain smaller amounts (15375). The Hibiscus sabdariffa seeds contain the highest concentration of lipid soluble antioxidants (15375). The Hibiscus sabdariffa flower is rich in anthocyanins, organic acids, and flavonoids (54999, 55001, 93807, 93808, 93809, 93816). Examples of anthocyanins include delphinidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (93804). Hibiscus sabdariffa acid and citric acid are examples of organic acids (93809). Hibiscus sabdariffa also contains nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin C and B vitamins, and other nutrients. The levels of specific nutrients depend on the part of the plant (93806, 93808).\n\nHibiscus sabdariffa seed contains about 19% oil. The main fatty acids contained in the oil include about 40% linoleic acid, 29% oleic acid, and 20% palmitic acid. The seed oil also contains several sterols including beta-sitosterol, 5-avenasterol, campesterol, and others (15375).\nAnthelmintic effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa extracts seem to have anthelmintic properties (11).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa is commonly used to reduce levels of blood glucose. In animal models of diabetes, Hibiscus sabdariffa reduced insulin resistance, the production of glycated end-products, and blood fats. Hibiscus sabdariffa also appears to inhibit the enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown (93808). In human research, drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa does not affect post-prandial glucose levels of insulin response (101732).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa might play a role in reduction of fever and pain. Hibiscus sabdariffa extract reduces levels of cytokines in animal models. It may also inhibit cyclooxygenase (93807, 93808). In animal and laboratory research, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract inhibited the cellular signaling that promotes inflammation in renal cells (93807). The inhibition of inflammatory processes, including gene expression, and infiltration of cells, has resulted in decreased kidney inflammation in an animal inflammatory model (93807). However, in human research, Hibiscus sabdariffa had no effect on levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (105307).\nAntimicrobial effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa is commonly used for urinary tract infections. Most research shows that Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts have antibacterial and antifungal activity in vitro (11, 93807, 93808). However, in other research, Hibiscus sabdariffa did not have antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (93806).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa extract might play a role in its clinical effects. Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts and major constituents have shown antioxidant effects in human, animal, and in vitro research. The main antioxidants appear to be the anthocyanins and protocatechuic acid (55001, 93808, 93809). The antioxidant effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa appear to play a role in the protection of blood vessels, as well as the kidney and liver (93808, 93812). Also, the antioxidant effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa might play a role in cellular signaling to induce apoptosis and death of cancer cells (93808). Additionally, a crossover clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa 100 mL twice daily for 6 months improves some oxidative indices (i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) and levels of antioxidant enzymes (i.e., glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductases, superoxide dismutase) when compared to baseline (112426).\nAntispasmodic effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa extracts seem to have intestinal and uterine muscle antispasmodic activity. Extracts can also relax smooth muscles of blood vessels and the bladder (11, 18, 93808).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn vitro, Hibiscus sabdariffa increases the intestinal permeability of the hydroxocobalamin form of vitamin B12. Theoretically, Hibiscus sabdariffa might increase the oral bioavailability of vitamin B12 (96271).\nHypotensive effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa extracts has demonstrated hypotensive effects in humans, including those with and without hypertension (16894, 54985, 54995, 102459, 105304, 108869, 112428, 112429). Various mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the potential hypotensive effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa. In animal research, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract had diuretic effects, increasing both urine production and sodium and chloride excretion, but not potassium excretion (93804). However, studies in animals and humans are mixed with respect to increased diuresis or increased excretion of electrolytes following Hibiscus sabdariffa consumption (93808, 93815). Other potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) or calcium influx, vasodilation, or histamine or acetylcholine-like mechanisms (93808, 93813, 93815, 101732). Increased flow mediated dilation has occurred in humans within 2 hours of drinking Hibiscus sabdariffa (101732). In humans, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract decreases blood levels of sodium, as well as potassium and chloride. This may also play a role (93815). Various constituents, including some anthocyanins, appear to have ACE inhibitory activity (93808).\nLactation effects\nHibiscus sabdariffa is commonly used to promote lactation. In animal research, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract increased levels of prolactin (93808).\nWeight loss effects\nIn animal research, Hibiscus sabdariffa appears to reduce adipogenesis and fat accumulation, as well as inhibit the breakdown and absorption of starch (93808). A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking a Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces tea 200 mL twice daily for 30 days modestly reduces abdominal circumference, but does not impact most lipid parameters, when compared with baseline (108869). Another small clinical study shows that taking a combination product containing lemon verbena and Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts was associated with an increase in satiety and a reduction in hunger. Additionally, the combination product was associated with preventing an increase in plasma levels of ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, and increasing plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases satiety. No changes were seen in levels of insulin, C-peptide, or fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (97290).\nWound healing effects\nIn animal research, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract in a cream had wound healing effects. The mechanism of action is not clear although it was considered to be possibly related to antioxidant effects and unlikely related to antibacterial mechanisms (93806)."

After administering 22.5 mcg/kg IV, peak concentrations ranged from 15-44 ng/mL. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was 5.39 ng h/mL (18030, 95552).\nMetabolism\nHigenamine is partially metabolized into a sulfate conjugate prior to excretion (95550).\nExcretion\nThe estimated clearance of higenamine is 3.8 L/minute (95550, 95552).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHigenamine is a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid. It is a constituent in several plant species including aconite, Annona squamosa, asarum, lotus, and Nandina domestica (sacred bamboo) (95550, 102052). Higenamine hydrochloride, the form of higenamine most often used in supplements, is generally synthetically manufactured rather than extracted from plants (95552).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHigenamine is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. Higenamine appears to affect multiple inflammatory processes. It appears to scavenge free radicals, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and decrease glycosaminoglycan polymerization (18022). Higenamine might also reduce inflammation by inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (18025).\nAnticoagulation effects\nHigenamine appears to have antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects. In an animal model of thrombosis, higenamine inhibited platelet aggregation and reduced the size of thrombus formation (18026).\nAntihistamine effects\nHigenamine is thought to have antihistamine effects. In an animal model, higenamine decreases swelling induced by histamine (18022). Additionally, in animal models, higenamine relaxes histamine-contracted tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle (18017, 18022, 18028).\nCardiovascular effects\nHigenamine appears to have cardiostimulant effects through agonistic activity at the beta2-adrenoreceptor (18017, 18022, 18028, 95552). It has been identified as the cardioactive constituent of aconite roots and Annona squamosa (18018, 18019, 18024). In the cardiac muscle, aconite appears to activate sodium channels leading to tachyarrhythmias (2634, 15499).\n\nIn humans and in animal tissue models, intravenous higenamine appears to have positive chronotropic and inotropic effects (18019, 18021, 18024, 18027, 95552). In animal and human models of bradycardia, higenamine increases heart rate (18020, 95552). One animal tissue study shows that higenamine increases heart rate through action on the sinoatrial node (102051). In animal models of heart failure, higenamine was also found to increase force of cardiac contraction (18024). Higenamine does not appear to significantly increase blood pressure in animal models, and in some cases, it has induced premature ventricular beats (18027).\nSexual enhancement effects\nThere is interest in using higenamine for erectile dysfunction. Due to its beta-adrenergic effects, higenamine appears to cause relaxation of animal model corpus cavernosum (18029)."

However, treatment did not affect levels of C-reactive protein (96311).\nAntibiotic effects\nIn cholera infection, mucosal secretion of water and electrolytes occur. This is due to cholera toxin stimulating levels of adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and prostaglandins. In animals, histidine decreases secretory responses through inhibition of intestinal adenylate cyclase. By reacting with prostaglandins, adenylate cyclase can be inhibited, leading to a block of cAMP formation, theoretically decreasing secretion of fluids (96312).\nAntioxidant effects\nHistidine can scavenge free radicals and chelate metal ions. In obese females with metabolic syndrome, supplementation with histidine for 12 weeks increased levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase when compared with placebo.

            "Overview": "Holy basil is an aromatic, perennial shrub (6). It is native to India, and is also found in Australia, West Africa, and some Middle Eastern countries. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine (55036, 91562, 91563) and is considered a sacred plant in Hinduism (91562). The Hindu name for holy basil, Tulsi, means \"the incomparable one\" (91564). Holy basil is sometimes called \"hot basil\" because of its peppery taste. It's often added to Southeast Asian dishes (91565).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, short-term. Holy basil leaf extract has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 500 mg daily for 60-90 days (12242, 18107, 19575, 91571, 96944). ...when used topically in the mouth, short-term. Holy basil has been used with apparent safety as a 4% mouthwash solution for up to 30 days (91570, 103621).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses during pregnancy or when trying to conceive. Animal research suggests that relatively high doses of holy basil extract (200 mg/kg) may reduce implantation rate when used for one week, while long-term use of higher doses (2-4 grams/kg) may decrease the number of full-term pregnancies (55040, 91569). There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the safety of holy basil during lactation; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally and topically, holy basil extract seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Loose stools and nausea.\n\nTopically: Bitter taste with oral application.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, two out of 24 participants taking capsules containing holy basil extract in one clinical study experienced nausea or loose stools (55037).\n\nTopically, holy basil mouthwash has been reported to cause a bitter taste in clinical trials (55038).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this condition.\nDental plaque. Small clinical studies suggest that topical use of holy basil mouthwash, gel, or toothpaste may modestly reduce the severity of dental plaque.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate dental plaque or gingivitis shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash containing holy basil leaf extract 4% twice daily for 30 days reduces plaque severity by about 17% to 28% when compared with baseline (91570, 103621). In one study, this effect was significant when compared with a placebo mouthwash and similar to a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine 0.12% (91570), whereas the other study did not conduct comparisons between study groups (103621). A small clinical study in patients with chronic gingivitis shows that applying holy basil extract 2% gel as a gingival massage twice daily for 30 days reduces plaque severity when compared with baseline (110030). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the other study groups. Also, a small clinical trial in children 14-15 years of age shows that brushing with toothpaste containing holy basil leaf extract 4% twice daily for 3 weeks reduces plaque severity when compared with placebo, with similar improvements when compared with a fluorinated toothpaste (104183).\n\nHoly basil has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small study shows that rinsing with 10 mL of a solution containing tea tree oil, clove, and holy basil (0.2% to 0.3% of each), for 30 seconds twice daily for 21 days, reduces plaque formation by 64%. This reduction is similar to a 72% reduction seen in the active control group using a mouth rinse containing thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, and methyl salicylate (91446).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that oral holy basil may modestly improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking holy basil dried leaf powder 2.5 grams daily for 4 weeks decreases fasting and postprandial blood glucose by 18%, compared with a 7% reduction in those taking placebo (12242). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking holy basil 250 mg twice daily in combination with glyburide 5 mg daily for 3 months reduces fasting blood glucose by 16%, postprandial blood glucose by 13%, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by 18% when compared with glyburide alone (91571).\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if oral holy basil is beneficial in patients with GAD.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with GAD shows that taking holy basil leaf extract 500 mg twice daily following meals for 60 days reduces anxiety and associated symptoms of stress and depression when compared to baseline (19575). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nGingivitis. Small clinical studies suggest that topical use of holy basil mouthwash or toothpaste may modestly improve gingivitis.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate dental plaque or gingivitis shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash containing holy basil leaf extract 4% twice daily for 30 days reduces gingivitis by about 23% to 40% when compared with baseline (91570, 103621). In one study, these effects were significant when compared with placebo mouthwash and similar to those of a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine 0.12% (91570), whereas the other study did not conduct statistical comparisons between study groups (103621). A small clinical trial in children 14-15 years of age shows that brushing with toothpaste containing holy basil leaf extract 4% twice daily for 3 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis when compared with placebo, with similar improvements when compared with a fluorinated toothpaste (104183). However, a small clinical study in patients with chronic gingivitis shows that applying holy basil leaf extract 2% gel as a gingival massage twice daily for 30 days does not reduce gingivitis severity when compared with baseline (110030).\n\nHoly basil has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study shows that rinsing with 10 mL of a solution containing tea tree oil, clove, and holy basil (0.2% to 0.3% of each), for 30 seconds twice daily for 21 days, reduces gum inflammation by 76%. This reduction is similar to a 70% reduction seen in the active control group using a mouth rinse containing thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, and methyl salicylate (91446).\nless\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nHepatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for hypercholesterolemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nInsect repellent. Although there has been interest in using topical holy basil as an insect repellent, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral holy basil is beneficial for sleep problems.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with stress and sleep problems (i.e., unrefreshing sleep or difficulty falling or staying asleep) shows that taking holy basil 125 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve patient-reported or wearable tracker scores related to sleep when compared with placebo (112416). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by self-reported outcomes and use of a non-validated measurement tool for sleep (i.e., Fitbit device).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral holy basil is beneficial in overweight or obese patients.\nOne small clinical study in individuals with overweight or obesity shows that taking holy basil extract 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks slightly reduces body weight and improves levels of triglycerides or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and certain glycemic indices when compared to baseline, but not when compared with no treatment. Holy basil extract also did not improve liver enzymes when compared to baseline or with no treatment (96944).\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. It is unclear if topical holy basil paste is beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with oral submucous fibrosis conducted in India shows that applying a paste containing holy basil extract 250 mg intraorally twice daily for 1 month modestly improves mouth opening scores and patient-reported burning sensation at the 3 month follow up when compared to baseline (112424). However, the validity of these findings is limited by poor methodology and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there has been interest in using oral holy basil for respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis, common cold, influenza, and tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for these conditions.\nStress. It is unclear if oral holy basil is beneficial in patients with stress.\nOne small clinical trial in patients experiencing various symptoms of stress shows that taking a specific holy basil extract (OciBest, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.) 400 mg in the morning and 800 mg at night for 6 weeks decreases self-reported symptoms of stress, including forgetfulness, sexual problems and sleep problems of recent origin, and frequency of exhaustion, when compared with placebo (18107). A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with stress and sleep problems shows that taking holy basil 125 mg twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves stress scores but does not improve individual symptoms related to stress including anxiety, mood disturbance, physical function, depression, fatigue, or sleep disturbance when compared with placebo (112416). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by self-reported outcome measures and unclear clinical significance.\nless\nTinea corporis. Although there has been interest in using topical holy basil for tinea corporis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of holy basil for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate holy basil for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of holy basil.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of holy basil are the leaf, stem, seed, and oil. Active constituents of the leaves and stems include saponins, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and tannins (12236). Some of these specific constituents include the flavonoids cirsilineol, cirsimaritin, isothymusin, apigenin, orientin, and vicenin; the polyphenols rosmarinic acid and isothymonin; and the triterpenoid ursoloic acid (15004, 55011, 55035, 55048). The leaves also contain an essential oil which contains eugenol, methyl eugenol, and caryophyllene (12239, 12242, 15004). Polysaccharides have also been found (55031). The seed oil of holy basil contains linoleic acid (52%), linolenic acid (17%), oleic acid (14%), palmitic acid (12%), and stearic acid (3%) (55030, 55054).\nAnalgesic effects\nHoly basil leaf extract seems to have analgesic activity in animal models (12246, 12248). It is thought to have both central and peripheral analgesic activity. The eugenol constituent is thought to be partially responsible for the analgesic activity (12248).\nAnthelmintic effects\nHoly basil leaf essential oil seems to have anthelmintic activity in vitro. This effect is thought to be due to the eugenol constituent (13252).\nAnti-inflammatory properties\nThere is preliminary evidence that the leaf extract and the seed oil of holy basil might reduce the inflammatory response in animals (12239, 12246, 55049, 55054). The linolenic acid component of the oil is thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect. It is thought to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism (12240, 12241, 55049). Constituents of the leaves and stems of holy basil including eugenol, cirsilineol, cirsimaritin, isothymusin, apigenin, rosmarinic acid, and isothymonin also appear to inhibit COX. Of these, eugenol appears to produce the strongest inhibition (15004). This is thought to contribute to the antipyretic effects of holy basil leaf and root extract demonstrated in animal models (12246, 12248, 91568).\nAnti-stress effects\nHoly basil is considered an anti-stress or adaptogenic remedy in Ayurvedic medicine. In clinical research, taking holy basil whole plant extract or leaf extract improves symptoms of stress and/or generalized anxiety disorder (18107, 19575, 112416).\n\nResearch in stress-induced rats suggests that holy basil fresh leaf juice may reduce anxiety-like behaviors and negative neuronal changes in the substantia nigra (112419). Another rat study attributes the anti-stress activity of holy basil to its ability to lower stress-induced increases in cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase (55016). Also, various animal models suggest that holy basil leaf extract can attenuate several measures of noise-induced stress response, including changes in plasma corticosterone levels and neurotransmitter levels in the brain (55009, 55015, 55024, 55028, 55032, 55051).\nAnti-toxin effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that an aqueous extract of holy basil leaves decreases some measures of mercury toxicity in animal models (12238).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using holy basil seed oil for cancer. Topically, holy basil fresh leaf paste or extract, applied to the buccal pouch mucosa of animals, has been shown to decrease the incidence of papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas, and increase survival rate in animal tumor models (55005). Orally, holy basil leaves have been shown to decrease the incidence of chemically-induced neoplasia, papillomas, and hepatomas in animal models (46863, 55043). Increased activity of enzymes known to detoxify carcinogens, including cytochrome P450, cytochrome b5, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, and glutathione S-transferase, has been observed in animal models following oral treatment with holy basil leaf extract (55047). Also, preliminary evidence suggests that the oil can delay progression and improve survival rate in animals with experimentally induced fibrosarcoma. This effect has been attributed to antioxidant effects of the oil (13253).\nAntilipidemic properties\nHoly basil leaf appears to lower levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, liver, heart, and kidneys in animal models (55044, 55052). Also, taking 2.5 grams of holy basil leaf powder daily for 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (12242). The exact mechanism of action is unclear.\nAntimicrobial effects\nHoly basil extracts inhibit various bacterial pathogens in vitro, including Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella typhi (40970, 55013, 55025). Holy basil oil inhibits Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro (55030). The antibacterial activity of holy basil oil has been attributed to its constituent linolenic acid (55030). In vitro, holy basil extract inhibits Candida albicans (55013).\nAntioxidant effects\nConstituents of holy basil, including eugenol, have shown antioxidant activity in vitro (15004, 44398). Also, evidence from animal research shows that holy basil leaf extracts and holy basil polysaccharides can reduce lipid peroxidation induced by hypercholesterolemia, myocardial infarction, or cerebral reperfusion injury (55012, 55020, 55021, 55031).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn an animal model, holy basil seed oil prolongs bleeding time, possibly due to inhibition of platelet aggregation. Linolenic acid contained in the seed oil can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA can inhibit thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which results in decreased platelet aggregation (13251). The seed oil of holy basil also seems to have a hypotensive effect, possibly due to a vasodilatory effect, in animal models (13251).\nDental effects\nThere is interest in using Holy basil for dental purposes, such as reducing plaque and gingivitis. Proposed mechanisms include possible activity against Streptococcus mutans, which has been demonstrated in vitro, or an increase in salivary pH (110031). Further research is needed to validate any mechanisms for this indication.\nEndocrine effects\nHoly basil has demonstrated activity on glycemic control, thyroid function, and androgen production. In animal models and in humans, there is preliminary evidence that holy basil leaf extract has hypoglycemic activity (12242, 12249, 12250, 49632, 55006, 55023, 55045, 55052). It is hypothesized the holy basil reduces blood glucose by improving beta-cell function and enhancing insulin secretion (12242). Other evidence from animal research suggests that the hypoglycemic activity of holy basil may result from its ability to correct reduced activity of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including glucokinase, hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase (55017).\n\nA relatively high dose of holy basil leaf extract (500 mg/kg) has been shown to decrease serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations in an animal model. Serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3) or the T3/T4 ratio were unaffected (55057). Also, animal research suggests that holy basil leaves decrease sperm count, sperm motility, and possibly fertility and reproductive behavior. Sperm parameters return to normal 2 weeks after discontinuing treatment (12243, 12244, 55014, 55018).\nGastrointestinal effects\nHoly basil seed oil and holy basil extract seem to have protective effects against aspirin, indomethacin, alcohol, and stress-induced ulceration in animals. It is thought that the oil or extracts might protect against gastric ulceration by reducing gastric acid secretion, increasing mucin secretion, inhibiting lipoxygenase, and having an antihistaminic effect (13254, 55019, 55029, 55046).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSeed oil from holy basil seems to have immunomodulatory effects. There is preliminary evidence that the oil can decrease the humoral and cell-mediated immune response to stress in animal models (12247). Also, in humans, holy basil extract increases levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and the percentages of T-helper cells and natural killer cells (55037).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nHoly basil has a variety of central nervous system effects. It reduces the duration of convulsions in animals subjected to electroshock- or pharmacologically-induced seizures. In animal models, holy basil leaf or stem extracts in doses of 400-1000 mg/kg have anticonvulsant effects comparable to phenytoin (12236, 96945). Although holy basil extract does not have additive effects with valproate in an animal model, the combination resulted in improved neurobehavioral outcomes, such as memory (96945).\n\nHoly basil also has some stimulatory effects in animal models. It also has additive activity with bromocriptine, suggesting that it has dompamine-2 receptor agonist activity (13056). Conversely, holy basil seed oil has been shown to prolong pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time in animals. However, this may be due to inhibition of the metabolism of pentobarbitone by cytochrome P450, as opposed to an additive sedative effect (13251).\nRadioprotective effects\nVarious animal models have shown that holy basil leaf extract protects against radiation injury and increases survival following exposure to gamma radiation. The radioprotective effect has been attributed to the free radical scavenging activity of the flavonoid constituents orientin and vicenin (55007, 55008, 55050, 55053, 55055, 55058, 55059). An aqueous extract appears to be more effective and less toxic than an aqueous ethanol extract, and intraperitoneal administration appears to be more effective than intramuscular, intravenous, or oral administration (55042).\nWound healing properties\nHoly basil leaf extract has been shown to increase wound healing in an animal model by increasing the rate of epithelization and wound contraction (55033)."

    "Homotaurine": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Homotaurine is an amino acid that is not involved in protein synthesis, but is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is found naturally in some types of algae (101093, 101094, 112072). Although homotaurine was under development as a prescription drug for Alzheimer disease, the FDA determined in 2007 that the results of a North American phase 3 trial did not demonstrate efficacy. The manufacturer then terminated a European trial in progress and decided to market homotaurine as a nutritional supplement (17067). The Alzheimer Association issued a statement stating that they do not support use of homotaurine, and that marketing it is not in the best interests of patients with Alzheimer disease, their families, or the general public (17068).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Homotaurine has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 150 mg twice daily for up to 36 months (17062, 17063, 17064, 17065, 101097, 101099, 101100, 104786).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of homotaurine when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

The most frequent side effects reported in clinical trials are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and sleep disorders (17063, 17064, 17065, 101097, 101099, 104786).\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, some of the most frequent side effects of homotaurine are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17063, 17064, 17065, 101097, 101099, 104786). Nausea and vomiting are dose-dependent and the incidence ranges from 5% to 30% with doses of 50-150 mg twice daily (17064). However, in some large studies, nausea and vomiting occurred at a similar rate in the placebo group (101097).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, some of the most frequent side effects of homotaurine are dizziness, headache, and sleep disorders (17063, 17064, 17065, 104786).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. The majority of research in individuals with Alzheimer disease shows that homotaurine does not improve cognitive function. However, homotaurine might have benefit in specific individuals with mild symptoms, especially those with homozygous APOE4/4 (17062, 17064, 17065, 17066, 17067, 101097, 101100, 101101).\nPreliminary clinical research in 58 patients over age 50 with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease has compared homotaurine 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg twice daily to placebo. After 3 months, there were dose-dependent reductions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)42, especially in patients with mild symptoms, but no change in cognitive or clinical measures of the disease (17062, 17064, 17065). Also, clinical research shows that taking homotaurine 150 mg twice daily for 78 weeks might preserve hippocampal volume (101100). However, in a large-scale, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 1052 patients, homotaurine was no more effective than placebo for improving cognitive function (17066, 17067, 101101). Despite this overall lack of benefit, a sub-analysis of two large clinical trials in patients with mild Alzheimer disease shows that homotaurine 150 mg twice daily for 78 weeks might stabilize cognitive function. This sub-analysis identified an improvement of 71% to 125% when compared with placebo, depending on the specific tool used to measure cognitive function. Also, the greatest effect appeared to occur in APOE4/4 homozygous patients. However, taking homotaurine 100 mg twice daily was no more effective than placebo, regardless of population (101097). Due to the exploratory nature of these sub-analyses, more research is needed to confirm benefits in patients with mild symptoms of Alzheimer disease, especially those homozygous to APOE4/4.\nless\nCognitive impairment. Preliminary clinical research in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment shows that taking homotaurine 50 mg twice daily for one year improves immediate short-term memory recall by about 18%, compared to a slight worsening in untreated patients. The improvement in memory with homotaurine is associated with anti-inflammatory activity, and an attenuation of hippocampal volume loss (101094, 101098, 112072).\nGlaucoma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with primary open-angle glaucoma and controlled intraocular pressure shows that taking homotaurine 50 mg, citicoline 500 mg, and vitamin E 12 mg orally once daily for 4 months, in addition to standard pressure-lowering treatment, improves visual contrast sensitivity scores and self-reported quality of life scores by about 10%, when compared with standard treatment alone (104786). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with primary open-angle glaucoma and intraocular pressure controlled with beta blocker and/or prostaglandin analog eye drops, shows that taking a specific combination of homotaurine 50 mg and citicoline 500 mg (Neuprozin) orally once daily for 4 months improves retinal cell function and neural conduction when compared with eye drop treatment alone, without altering intraocular pressure. Pattern standard deviation, which measures localized loss in the visual field is improved (112074). It is unclear if these effects are due to homotaurine, other ingredients, or the combinations, although some evidence suggests a synergistic effect between homotaurine and citicoline (112074).\nParkinson disease. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking homotaurine 50 mg twice daily for 6 months does not improve symptoms of Parkinson disease when compared with no treatment. However, it has a modest effect on daytime sleepiness when compared to baseline (101099). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nMore evidence is needed to rate homotaurine for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nHomotaurine is bioavailable when taken orally. Peak plasma levels occur 1.5-2.5 hours after ingesting regular tablets, and 4-6 hours after ingesting enteric-coated tablets (17062, 17063, 17065). The peak level is increased 1.5-fold when homotaurine is taken with a high-fat meal, but the total amount absorbed is unchanged (17065).\nDistribution\nHomotaurine is transported across the blood-brain barrier (17064, 17065, 112072).\nExcretion\nThe plasma elimination half-life of homotaurine is 1-3 hours, but the half-life for elimination from the brain is longer (17062, 17063, 17064, 17065).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHomotaurine is an amino acid that is not used for protein synthesis, but is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (112072). It is found in certain types of seaweed, although the homotaurine used in supplements is typically prepared synthetically (101093, 101094).\nAlcohol dependence effects\nAnimal research suggest that homotaurine can reduce ethanol craving and intake. The proposed mechanism of this effect is interference with ethanol-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward system in the brain (17053). A derivative of homotaurine, calcium acetylhomotaurinate, known as acamprosate, is FDA-approved for maintenance of abstinence in people with alcohol dependence.\nAnti-dementia effects\nThere is interest in using homotaurine for treatment of Alzheimer disease. One of the processes linked to the progression of Alzheimer disease is the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain (17062, 17065). The primary constituent of these plaques is amyloid-beta peptides, which are formed by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (17061, 17065). Homotaurine binds to soluble amyloid-beta peptides, interfering with the binding of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and therefore with the formation of amyloid-beta fibrils, aggregation of fibrils, and formation of amyloid plaques (17061, 17062, 17064, 17065). This mechanism of action suggests that homotaurine is most likely to slow progression of Alzheimer disease, and is more likely to be effective in early disease, before large amounts of amyloid plaque have been formed (17062, 17064). Cell culture and animal studies have demonstrated that homotaurine can maintain amyloid-beta in a non-fibrillar form, can decrease cell death induced by amyloid-beta42, and can inhibit amyloid deposition (17061, 17064, 17065). In animals, homotaurine reduces brain amyloid plaque load, decreases cerebral levels of soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta40 and amyloid-beta42, and reduces plasma amyloid-beta levels (17061, 17064, 17065).\n\nAmyloid-beta peptides are also involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This condition occurs with aging, and involves accumulation of amyloid in cerebral blood vessels, causing vessel breakdown and hemorrhagic stroke (17063). People with certain apolipoprotein E genotypes are at increased risk for this condition. In an animal model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, homotaurine binds soluble amyloid-beta and reduces vascular amyloid deposition (17063).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human studies, taking homotaurine 50 mg twice daily for 12 months decreases levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-18, and increases levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-33, when compared to baseline (112072).\nEffects in autism\nIn a valproic acid-induced animal model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), homotaurine, 50 mg by intraperitoneal injection daily for 21 days, ameliorates behavioral deficits, including decreased sociability and spatial memory, and increased stereotypy. Possible mechanisms include decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, as shown by lowering of malondialdehyde and proinflammatory cytokine levels, and increasing superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, catalase, and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. ASD is thought to involve dysregulation of GABA-ergic signaling, and homotaurine can normalize expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 which is involved in GABA synthesis. It also preserves Purkinje cell density in the cerebellum, and decreases pyknosis in the prefrontal cortex (112073).\nGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-like effects\nMany of the potential clinical benefits of homotaurine may be related to its role as a GABA receptor agonist, including neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Homotaurine is an agonist at GABA-A receptors (17056, 17057). Other agonists at these receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects. Anticonvulsant effects of homotaurine have been reported in preliminary studies. Animals pretreated with homotaurine were partially protected from seizures and pathologic brain changes caused by injection of kainic acid (17054).\n\nHomotaurine also has a small effect on presynaptic GABA-B receptors, acting as a weak agonist (17055, 17056, 17059, 101093). Both agonist and competitive antagonist effects of homotaurine at GABA-B receptors have been reported in vitro (17055, 17056, 17057). Agonists at GABA-B receptors cause opening of potassium channels, and inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (17055, 17056, 17059). Preliminary data suggest that actions at GABA-B receptors in the CNS may be responsible for analgesic effects of homotaurine (17055, 17056, 17058, 17059). These analgesic effects are potentiated by baclofen, which is a GABA-B agonist (17055, 17058). The analgesic effects of homotaurine are also potentiated by morphine and inhibited by naloxone, suggesting opioid mechanisms are involved (17058).\nImmune effects\nIn animal models, homotaurine seems to inhibit effector T cell proliferation and enhance T regulatory responses by acting as a GABA receptor agonist. This mechanism is thought to play a role in the modest reversal of newly-developed, but not severe, hyperglycemia in an animal model of early type 1 diabetes, as well as benefits in other autoimmune models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (101093, 101096).\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using homotaurine to treat glaucoma. Some researchers have suggested homotaurine may prevent retinal ganglion cell death by inhibiting amyloid aggregation and/or GABA-like activity, but research evaluating these theories is lacking (104786)."

Concerns about botulism pertain only to children under 12 months of age and not to adults (13160). ...when used topically and appropriately. A specific commercially available wound dressing containing manuka honey (Medihoney) is approved as a medical device by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (16353, 16355, 16357, 16362, 16369, 16371). Some evidence suggests other honey preparations can also be used safely when applied to the skin or used to rinse the mouth (395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 7847, 7849, 13133, 14317)(16358, 16372, 97704, 101034, 108530).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when properly diluted honey is used intranasally. Manuka honey 16.5% solution has been used with apparent safety as a nasal rinse twice daily for 14 days (103969). ...when specific, medical-grade honey products are used in eye drops. A specific product (Optimel Manuka Plus Eye Drops, Melcare Biomedical Pty Ltd) has been used safely 2-3 times daily for up to 4 weeks (105231, 105234).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when honey produced from the nectar of rhododendrons is used orally. This type of honey contains grayanotoxins, which may lead to cardiovascular symptoms, such as arrhythmias, hypotension, chest pain, bradycardia, syncope, asystole, various types of heart block, and myocardial infarction (12220, 55119, 55122, 55125, 55126, 55129, 55141, 55142, 55157)(55163, 55170, 55171, 55180, 55183, 55190, 55224, 55233, 55234, 55239)(55248, 55260, 55261, 55280, 55281).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term in children at least 12 months of age (15910, 17299, 55210, 55253, 97693).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in children less than 12 months of age. Ingestion of raw honey contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores can cause botulism poisoning in infants under 12 months of age (13160, 55067, 55290, 91359). This is not a danger for older children or adults. Medical-grade, sterilized honey has been used with apparent safety in the formula of premature newborns at doses of up to 15 grams daily for up to 2 weeks (97697).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in food amounts. The concern about botulism pertains to children under 12 months of age and not to pregnant adults (13160). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of honey when used for medicinal purposes when pregnant or breast-feeding.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, honey is generally well tolerated in those at least 1 year of age. When given intranasally or into the eyes, honey seems to be well tolerated. However, honey containing grayanotoxins, which are found in rhododendrons, is likely unsafe and should be avoided.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Nausea, stomach pain, and vomiting.\n\nTopically: Burning, pain, and stinging.\n\nIntranasally: Burning and nausea.\n\nOcular: Stinging.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports of botulism in infants have occurred. Anaphylaxis has been reported in sensitive individuals. Honey from the Black Sea coast of Turkey, which is derived from the nectar of rhododendrons, has caused respiratory depression, dizziness, sweating, weakness, bradycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction within a few minutes to several hours after consumption.\nCardiovascular\nHoney from the Black Sea coast of Turkey has been linked with a unique form of poisoning. Honey from this region sometimes contains excessive concentrations of grayanotoxins from rhododendrons, which can cause bradycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and hypotension within a few minutes to several hours after consumption (12220, 55110, 55126, 55129, 55238, 55269, 55270, 55280). Fatalities have not been reported. Patients typically respond to fluids and reversal of cardiac conduction abnormalities with atropine.\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, the use of honey applied to wounds can cause local pain, stinging, and burning in about 5% of patients, some of whom stop treatment as a result (16356, 16357, 16358, 16361, 91362, 97694, 96595). Theoretically, honey may cause excessive drying of wounds, which could delay healing. This can be managed by application of saline packs as needed (7850).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, honey may cause mild nausea, vomiting, and stomach ache (12220, 55119, 55190, 55294, 97693). Honey from the Black Sea coast of Turkey has been linked with a unique form of poisoning. Honey from this region sometimes contains excessive concentrations of grayanotoxins. These toxins can cause increased salivation, nausea, and vomiting within a few minutes to several hours after consumption (12220, 55119, 55190, 55294). Intranasally, honey may cause nausea (55216).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, honey can cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (6, 11, 108531, 108532). These reactions may be due to various components of the honey, including the honey itself, pollen, or bee secretions (91370). When used topically, local allergic reactions have been reported in people with pre-existing atopy (16356, 55118). Allergic contact dermatitis related to honey enriched with propolis has been reported (91365).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, honey may cause nervousness, insomnia, and hyperactivity in children (91366, 97693). Honey from the Black Sea coast of Turkey has been linked with a unique form of poisoning. Honey from this region sometimes contains excessive concentrations of grayanotoxins, which can cause dizziness, sweating, and weakness within a few minutes to several hours after consumption (12220, 55110, 55119, 55296).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nWhen used in eye drops, transient stinging has been reported rarely (105231, 105234).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen used intranasally, a burning sensation of the nasal passages has been reported (55216). Honey from the Black Sea coast of Turkey, which sometimes contains excessive concentrations of grayanotoxins, can cause respiratory depression within a few minutes to several hours after consumption (12220, 55110, 55119, 55296).\nless\nOther\nSome honey is contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores, which poses a risk to infants (6, 11, 13160, 55067, 55290, 91359). Botulinum spores can proliferate in the intestines of infants and cause botulism poisoning (55112). However, this is not a concern for older children and adults.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBurns. Topical application of gauze containing honey seems to improve burn healing.\nHoney applied directly in gauze applications seems to improve formation of granulation tissue and speed healing time in partial thickness burns. The benefits of honey appear to be comparable to topical antibiotics, including silver sulfadiazine and moisture permeable polyurethane dressing (OpSite) (395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 14317, 55175, 55200, 55204, 55264)(91363, 97696). In these studies, honey has been used under dressings or impregnated in gauze as needed for up to 12 weeks. The duration between changing of dressings or gauze has varied (395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 55175, 55200, 55204, 55264, 91363). One small clinical study in adults with moderate burns shows that early surgical intervention with tangential excision and skin grafting appears to improve outcomes when compared with honey (7848). However, poor study design limits the reliability of these findings.\nless\nCough. Most studies show that oral honey reduces cough in children. It is unclear whether oral honey is beneficial for cough in adults.\nClinical research shows that taking honey 2.5-10 mL (0.5-2 teaspoons) at bedtime reduces nighttime cough frequency and severity and improves sleep when compared with placebo in children aged 2 years and older with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (15910, 55253, 97693, 103959). Honey also appears to be at least as effective as the cough suppressant dextromethorphan in typical over-the-counter doses (15910, 17299, 97693). The effects of honey on cough duration are not known (97693). One clinical study in children 1-5 years of age with URTIs and cough for up to 7 days shows that acacia honey is similarly effective to a honey-flavored placebo, given as 3 mL one hour before bedtime for 2 consecutive nights, for reducing cough frequency and severity and improving sleep (110003). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nA meta-analysis of the available research suggests that honey does not improve cough in adults when compared with usual care (103959). However, due to the small number of available studies, the analysis might have been inadequately powered to detect a smaller magnitude of benefit. Some research in adults has also evaluated honey in combination with other ingredients. In adults with post-infectious cough of at least 3 weeks' duration, taking 25 grams of a paste in a warm water solution providing honey 20.8 grams and coffee 2.9 grams every 8 hours for one week reduces cough frequency by about 93% when compared with baseline. Those taking prednisolone experienced a cough reduction of 20% (91367). It is unclear if this effect is due to honey, coffee paste, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Topical honey seems to be beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers.\nA meta-analysis of mainly lower quality clinical trials including 267-616 patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying dressings impregnated with honey for 1-2 weeks shortens the wound debridement and healing time and increases the rate of wound healing by moderate to large amounts when compared with other dressings (101032). Individual clinical studies also show that using dressings impregnated with manuka honey (Medihoney Tulle Dressing) or beri honey decreases healing time for diabetic foot ulcers by 11-12 days and reduces the need for antibiotics when compared with saline-soaked gauze (19739, 91364, 97701).\nless\nDry eye. Specific manuka honey eyedrops seem to be modestly beneficial for improving symptoms of dry eye.\nMost clinical research shows that specific honey products might be helpful for symptoms of dry eye (97694, 97695, 105231, 105234). Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific manuka honey product (Optimel Manuka Plus Dry Eye Drops, Melcare Biomedical Pty Ltd) 2-3 times daily for 14 or 28 days reduces some, but not all, measures of eye discomfort (97694, 105234). In patients with dry eye due to contact lenses, dry eye symptoms were reduced by about 18% when compared with baseline (97694). In patients with general mild dry eye symptoms, preliminary clinical research shows that symptoms were reduced by about 52% when compared with baseline (105234). These improvements were significant when compared with lubricant drops (97694, 105234).\n\nSpecific honey products also seem to be beneficial for dry eye associated with meibomian gland dysfunction. In these patients, preliminary clinical research shows that using Optimel Manuka Plus Eye Drops (Melcare, Biomedical Pty Ltd) or Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Gel (Melcare Biomedical Pty Ltd) twice daily for 3 or 8 weeks along with warm compresses improves the function of the tear glands (97695, 105231). In one study, 73% to 95% of participants using the honey products required less lubricant, compared with 48% of participants using warm compresses alone. However, the honey products did not improve bacterial counts, redness, or dryness (97695). In another study, eye dryness, lid margin, conjunctival redness, and meibomian gland function were modestly improved when compared with baseline. All improvements were statistically similar to the control group receiving a lubricant. However, patients using a lubricant did not experience an improvement in eye dryness when compared to baseline (105231).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Applying honey to cold sores may heal lesions 2-4 days faster than conventional therapies.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials, including one relatively large study, in patients with herpes labialis shows that applying honey to lesions 4-5 times daily reduces lesion healing time by around 2 days, although it does not improve pain when compared with acyclovir 5% cream (108526). Also, a small crossover trial in patients with recurrent cold sores shows that applying medical grade honey three times daily to lesions at the onset of symptoms or blistering reduces lesion healing time by around 4 days and improves symptoms such as pain and itching when compared with conventional treatments, which ranged from prescription antivirals to herbal remedies and wound care products (108527).\nless\nOral mucositis. Rinsing the mouth with and then slowly swallowing honey seems to be beneficial for oral mucositis prevention or treatment, although most research is lower quality.\nAlthough contradictory evidence exists (55219, 91361), most research shows that honey may have some benefit in preventing or reducing symptoms of oral mucositis (16352, 55133, 55137, 55202, 55241, 55245, 55265, 91368, 97704, 104562). A meta-analysis of eight trials shows that applying honey reduces the development of intolerable oral mucositis lesions by approximately 52%. Applying honey to lesions also appears to reduce pain associated with oral mucositis; however, the number of studies included in this latter analysis was small (101035). Another meta-analysis suggests that pure natural honey may be more effective than manuka honey or local honey for treating oral mucositis (101034). However, these analyses have significant quality issues. They included studies that did not fit inclusion criteria and omitted studies that did fit inclusion criteria (103967). The majority of these studies have had patients rinse with and then slowly swallow up to 20 mL honey three times or more daily, usually before radiation therapy, 15 minutes after radiation therapy, and 6 hours after radiation therapy or at bedtime. Some studies have used honey topically or as ice chips or lozenges (16352, 55133, 55137, 55202, 55219, 55241, 55265, 91361, 97704, 101034)(101035, 104562). Also, rinsing the mouth and swallowing a paste of honey or honey and coffee 10 mL every 3 hours for one week has been used (91368). Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing chemoradiation and using conventional treatments shows that a combination of licorice powder 5 grams mixed in honey and applied twice daily along with oral licorice powder 500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks also seems to reduce the risk of oral mucositis and severe symptoms when compared with conventional treatments alone (104562). However, it is not clear whether any benefit in this study is due to honey, licorice, or the combination.\n\nIn pediatric intensive care patients aged 2-16 years, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a local honey, 1-1.5 grams/kg in two divided doses, with a spoon to the inside of the mouth, teeth, lips, and tongue, reduces the severity and development of oral mucositis when compared with using chlorhexidine. However, honey was not as effective as topical vitamin E (101036).\nless\nRosacea. Topical honey seems to be beneficial for rosacea.\nClinical research in adults shows that applying a 90% medical-grade kanuka honey (Honevo) with glycerin to affected areas twice daily for 8 weeks and washed off after 30-60 minutes is more effective than Cetomacrogol, an emollient, for improving symptoms of rosacea. Approximately twice as many patients responded to the honey product when compared with Cetomacrogol cream (97699).\nless\nWound healing. Topical honey seems to improve the healing of various types of wounds, although the optimal formulation and application regimen remains unclear.\nSeveral small clinical trials and case reports describe the use of honey or honey-impregnated dressings for various types of wounds, including post-surgical wounds, chronic leg ulcers, abscesses, burns, abrasions, lacerations, and skin graft donor sites. Honey seems to improve granulation and epithelialization, reduce odors and purulent exudate, help clean the wound, increase eradication of infection, reduce pain, and decrease time to healing (7847, 7849, 14317, 16354, 16355, 16357, 16358, 16360, 16362, 16369)(16372, 16374, 55109, 55130, 55144). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that applying honey reduces healing time of partial thickness burns by 4.7 days when compared with conventional dressing and about 5 days when compared with silver sulfadiazine. Honey also appears to improve healing time for postoperative wounds when compared with antiseptic washes followed by gauze (55264). In some reports, wounds healed with honey after failing previous treatments (16369, 16371).\n\nHoney applied directly to wounds appears to be comparable to hydrogels such as carboxymethylcellulose, povidone iodine, and hypochlorite solutions (16355, 16358, 16360, 16376, 55235). Honey dressings also appear to be comparable to hydrocolloid dressings, paraffin gauze, nanocrystalline silver, and saline-soaked gauze (16358, 16360, 16372, 55101). However, poor study design limits the reliability of some of these findings. Trials cannot be directly compared due to variation in wound type and severity, patient characteristics, honey type and processing, dressing techniques, treatment duration, and concomitant use of antibiotics. Adequate blinding is also difficult to achieve due to the distinctive properties and smell of honey (16360). Many of the clinical trials used manuka honey, which is derived from the nectar of Leptospermum scoparium and is gamma irradiated to inactivate bacterial spores (16355, 16357, 16362, 16369, 16371). Other trials used unprocessed honey (16358, 16372). Honey dressings are typically changed every 24-48 hours, although in some cases dressings are changed only twice weekly (16355, 16362, 16372, 16374, 55101, 55130, 55235). In children aged 2 months to 14 years, honey soaked gauze has been packed into wounds twice daily until closure (16376). When used directly, unprocessed honey or manuka honey 15-30 mL has been applied and covered with sterile gauze and bandages or a polyurethane dressing. When applied directly, honey is typically used every 12-48 hours, although in some cases it has been used only once weekly (16354, 16358, 16369, 16372, 16376, 55144).\nless\nHerpetic gingivostomatitis. Slowly swallowing honey seems to be beneficial for herpetic gingivostomatitis treatment in children.\nClinical research in children aged 2-8 years with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis shows that use of a local honey 5 mL every 4 hours with slow swallowing, in combination with acyclovir 15 mg/kg five times daily for 7 days, results in the clearing of oral lesions 3 days faster when compared with acyclovir and a placebo syrup. Drooling and difficulties eating also improved faster, and pain and the need for analgesics were reduced. Fever and extra-oral lesions were not improved (101038).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAcne. Topical honey does not seem to be beneficial for acne.\nClinical research in adolescents and adults 16 years of age and older shows that applying a 90% medical-grade kanuka honey (Honevo) with glycerine to the face twice daily after using an antibacterial soap does not improve facial acne when compared with antibacterial soap alone (97700).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral honey does not seem to improve lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 15 small clinical studies in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking honey 20-75 grams daily for up to 4 months does not reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with control (108533).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Intranasal honey does not seem to be beneficial for improving symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis.\nA small clinical study in adults who have undergone maximal medical and surgical treatment for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis shows that using 2 mL of an intranasal spray containing honey 50% in saline once daily at night for 30 days does not reduce symptoms when compared with usual treatment (55216). Manuka honey nasal spray also does not seem to work better than saline spray in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis. A small clinical study shows that manuka honey 10% (Medihoney, Derma Sciences) in saline sinus irrigation twice daily for 30 days is no more effective than saline irrigation for reducing overall symptoms (97705). Additionally, a small clinical study in patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis shows that using manuka honey 16.5% twice daily augmented with 1.3 mg/mL methylglyoxal sinonasal rinses for 14 days is no better than taking targeted oral antibiotics and performing normal saline rinses twice daily (103969). However, this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference between treatment groups. Additional research is needed to determine if honey-containing nasal sprays are beneficial in circumstances with limited access to antibiotics or nasal steroids, or in patients with high immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels (55216, 97705).\n\nIntranasal honey has also been evaluated in patients recovering from surgery for rhinosinusitis. A small clinical study in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis who have undergone endoscopic sinus surgery shows that applying 2 mL of Tualang honey to the nasal dressing, which remains in place for one week, results in similar improvements in symptoms when compared with a triamcinolone-containing dressing at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery. However, at 3 months after surgery, triamcinolone seems to provide further improvement in rhinosinusitis symptoms and surgical recovery when compared with honey (108529).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for hay fever.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming honey one tablespoon (20 grams) daily, in addition to standard treatment, does not improve allergy symptoms (14319). Other preliminary clinical research shows that ingesting honey 1 gram/kg daily for 4 weeks, in addition to taking loratadine 10 mg daily, may improve allergic symptoms during treatment and for up to 4 weeks following cessation of treatment. However, it's not clear if this improvement is significant when compared with loratadine alone (91360).\nless\nAlveolar osteitis. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for alveolar osteitis.\nA small, low-quality clinical study in patients with alveolar osteitis after dental surgery shows that applying gauze soaked in 2 mL of honey, 3 times over 10 days, improves healing, pain, and formation of granulation tissue when compared with baseline (103961).\nless\nAsthma. Oral honey has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking a combination of honey and black seed modestly improves measures of lung function when compared with baseline in patients with moderate to severe asthma. However, another preliminary clinical study using this combination did not show improvement on all measures. Both studies were small and may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes (105228). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of honey and celery seed modestly improves some measures of lung function when compared with baseline (105228). It is unclear whether any benefit is due to honey, the other ingredient, or the combinations. Additionally, the validity of these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAthletic performance. Although there is interest in using oral honey to improve athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of honey for this purpose.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for atopic dermatitis.\nIn patients with bilateral atopic dermatitis, a small preliminary clinical trial shows that topical application of manuka honey to one site overnight for 7 days improves lesions when compared to baseline (105239). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo comparator group.\nless\nBlepharitis. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for blepharitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with blepharitis shows that applying MGO Manuka Honey microemulsion (Manuka Health New Zealand Ltd) eye cream to closed eyelids nightly for 3 months improves symptoms of dry eye and reduces ocular mites and bacterial load when compared with no intervention (103962). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo comparator group.\nless\nCataracts. Although there is interest in using topical honey for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of honey for this condition.\nCatheter-related infections. It is unclear if topical medical honey is beneficial for preventing catheter-related infections in patients on hemodialysis or in those with diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that manuka honey (Medihoney, Medihoney Pty Ltd) applied three times weekly to the exit sites of tunneled, cuffed central venous hemodialysis catheters is as effective as mupirocin ointment in reducing the incidence of catheter-associated infection and bacteremia. It may also be associated with a lower rate of bacterial resistance than mupirocin (16361). A retrospective analysis also found that use of povidone iodine for dialysis catheter site care is associated with a 58% increased cumulative incidence rate of exit-site infections or peritonitis when compared with use of medical honey. Patients were followed from catheter insertion until catheter removal, transplant, death, or end of treatment (101039). However, well-designed clinical research shows that application of antibacterial honey (Medihoney Antibacterial Wound Gel, Comvita) 10 mg at the exit site along with standard care is no more effective than standard care alone for reducing dialysis-related infections (91362).\n\nIt is unclear if honey reduces the risk of catheter-related infection in patients with diabetes. Some evidence shows that applying an antibacterial honey product approximately doubles the risk of infection and peritonitis in patients with diabetes when compared with no honey (91362). However, a large retrospective analysis found that exit-site application of honey was associated with a lower chance of peritoneal dialysis-related infection when compared with povidone iodine, even in patients with diabetes (101039).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. Oral honey has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with breast cancer and chemotherapy-related fatigue shows that taking a specific product (Jollab tonic beverage) containing honey, saffron, and rose water, as 20 mL three times daily for 4 weeks, reduces scores on a cancer fatigue scale when compared with placebo. Scores on a visual analog fatigue scale and on a fatigue severity scale were only improved when compared with baseline, not placebo (110001).\nless\nCorneal opacity. Although there is interest in using topical honey for corneal opacity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of honey for this purpose.\nCorneal ulceration. It is unclear if honey-containing ophthalmic drops are beneficial for corneal ulceration.\nA small clinical study in patients with foreign body-induced corneal ulceration shows that applying ophthalmic drops containing honey into the affected eye every 6 hours for 14 days might speed up healing of corneal epithelial defect, but does not improve corneal infiltration, when compared with using ciprofloxacin eye drops. The honey in these drops was produced from the nectar of various ziziphus species (103968). The validity of this study is limited by its small size and short duration.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for diabetes.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, small clinical trials show that taking honey 50 grams or 1-2.5 grams/kg daily for 8 weeks increases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by a small amount (55182, 105235). However, lower doses of 5-25 grams daily for 16 weeks or 0.5 grams/kg daily for 12 weeks seem to have no effect on HbA1c and may modestly reduce levels when compared to baseline or no treatment (105230, 105236). Also, although some research disagrees, taking honey does not seem to affect fasting levels of insulin or glucose, or measures of insulin resistance (105230, 105235, 105236).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of honey on lipid levels in patients with diabetes. Some preliminary clinical research shows that consuming honey 0.5-2.5 grams/kg daily modestly decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and modestly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (55182, 105230), while other research does not show any effect on plasma lipids (105236). In patients with type 1 diabetes, one clinical study shows that taking honey 0.5 mL/kg daily for 12 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol when compared with control (55263).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nIn patients with mild to moderate diabetic neuropathy who are taking antidiabetes medications and gabapentin, preliminary clinical research shows that taking honey 0.5 gram/kg daily in water for 3 months modestly reduces nerve pain and improves quality of life when compared with baseline. Nerve conduction was generally not affected (105230). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of an appropriate control group.\nless\nDiarrhea. Small clinical studies suggest that oral honey is beneficial in children and infants with diarrhea.\nOne small clinical study in children and infants with gastroenteritis shows that adding honey to oral rehydration solution (ORS) at a concentration of 50 mL per liter ORS decreases the frequency of vomiting and diarrhea, and reduces recovery time when compared with ORS alone (55194). Other clinical research shows that adding honey to ORS at the same concentration reduces the duration of diarrhea by about 1.4 days when compared with standard ORS in infants and children with bacterial gastroenteritis, but not when all types of gastroenteritis are considered (55273). Another small clinical study in children hospitalized with acute diarrhea shows that taking 1.5-2 mL of honey every 6 hours for 5 days plus 5 mL of zinc gluconate syrup, providing 5 mg of elemental zinc, every 6 hours for 10 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by 6.5 hours and the duration of hospitalization by 24 hours when compared with zinc gluconate alone (108534).\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for dry mouth associated with intubation.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small group of intubated adults in an intensive care unit shows that applying Indonesian honey 20 mL to all areas of the mouth with a brush and gauze swab twice daily for 3 days, in addition to standard oral care with 20 mL chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%, improves overall oral health scores on a modified Beck Oral Assessment Scale when compared with chlorhexidine alone (110002).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for dysmenorrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking honey 1.2 mg/kg daily, starting on the 15th day of the menstrual cycle and continuing until the onset of menstruation, is comparable to mefenamic acid 250 mg every 6 hours for reducing pain associated with dysmenorrhea (97702).\nless\nGenital herpes. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for genital herpes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a gauze soaked with honey four times daily to the lesion until healing does not improves symptoms or healing time (55095).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if chewing \"leather\" made from manuka honey is beneficial for gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that chewing \"leather\" made from manuka honey after meals for 21 days reduces plaque severity and the number of bleeding sites when compared to baseline in patients with gingivitis and plaque (55091).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Topical honey has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a spoonful of a mixture containing equal volumes of honey, olive oil, and beeswax to the skin twice daily for up to 4 weeks reduces bleeding and itching when compared to baseline in patients with hemorrhoids (34100). It is not clear if these effects are due to honey, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking honey does not improve glycemic control or lipid levels in patients with prediabetes. In one study, taking honey (Dutch Gold Honey) providing 50 grams of carbohydrates daily for 2 weeks does not improve these measures when compared with sucrose or corn syrup providing similar amounts of carbohydrates (105238). In another study, taking Malaysian Kelulut honey (Bayu Kelulut) 30 grams daily for 30 days was not beneficial (105237). The validity of these studies is limited by the lack of an appropriate control group.\nless\nLeishmania lesions. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for leishmania lesions.\nSome research shows that honey might prevent the healing of leishmania lesions. One preliminary clinical study shows that applying honey-soaked gauze onto leishmania lesions twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to receiving a glucantime injection reduces the proportion of patients with healed wounds by about 28% when compared with glucantime injection alone (55118).\nless\nMale infertility. Intravaginal honey has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying 10 mL of a combination mixture containing various bee products intravaginally immediately before or after each coital act, beginning one day after the last menstruation and continuing for three menstrual cycles or until pregnancy, increases pregnancy rate from 3% to 8% when compared to standard intrauterine insemination in couples having difficulty getting pregnant due to male asthenozoospermia. However, since all unsuccessful couples were crossed over to the alternative treatment after 2 months, the causality of successful pregnancy is unclear. The mixture consisted of Egyptian bee honey 100 grams, royal jelly 3 grams, and bee bread 1 teaspoon, which was diluted in saline in a 1:1 ratio prior to application (55131).\nless\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for malnutrition in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in infants and children with a mean age of 11-13 months with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) shows that honey improves weight and other biomarkers when compared to control. Honey 2 mL/kg diluted in water was used daily for 2 weeks in combination with conventional nutritional rehabilitation (55196, 55210).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for metabolic control in postmenopausal individuals.\nIn postmenopausal individuals, preliminary clinical research shows that taking Tualang honey 20 grams daily for 4 months results in a slight increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fasting blood sugar when compared with baseline. However, there were no statistically significant differences in lipid profile, glycemic control, or bone density when compared with low-dose hormone replacement therapy (105241). The validity of this study is limited by its short duration and lack of blinding.\nless\nNecrotizing fasciitis. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for necrotizing fasciitis.\nPreliminary clinical research has shown conflicting results with the use of honey, applied directly and covered with a dressing or applied as a honey-soaked gauze, given as an adjunct to antibiotics, for the treatment of Fournier's gangrene, a type of necrotizing fasciitis (55106, 55293, 55295, 55315, 91363).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral honey is beneficial for metabolic control in adolescents with obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research in obese prepubertal females on a calorie-reduced diet shows that consuming a wild flower and thyme honey product (Attiki) 15 grams daily for 6 months does not improve levels of glucose, insulin, or blood lipids when compared with a marmalade control (101037).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral honey has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults 40-85 years of age with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific product (G-rup syrup, Yas Daru Pharmaceutical Co.) containing honey 150 mg/mL and ginger extract 100 mg/mL in a dose of 30 mL twice daily for 12 weeks reduces pain scores on a visual analog scale and improves scores on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) when compared with baseline. Total WOMAC scores decreased by about 7 in the active group and by 4 in the placebo group (110000). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. Additionally, it is unclear whether these changes would be considered clinically significant.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral honey for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of honey for this condition.\nPostoperative pain. Several small clinical studies suggest that topical honey may reduce pain after tonsillectomy in children and adults.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in children 3 years and older immediately post-tonsillectomy shows that honey might reduce pain, analgesic use, and night-time awakening by a small to moderate amount in the week after surgery when compared with placebo or control. In these studies, honey was used in doses ranging from 4-15 mL every hour or once daily for 1-7 days (97703). A small observational cohort in adults post-tonsillectomy has found that applying honey 20 grams to the oral cavity for 5 minutes, 8 times daily for the first 5 days after surgery, is associated with reduced pain and bleeding when compared with usual treatment (103963). Another small clinical trial in adults post-tonsillectomy shows that gargling and then swallowing a solution containing 15 mL of honey mixed with 5 mL of water for two minutes every 6 hours for 10 days reduces pain and analgesic use when compared with placebo or no treatment (108530).\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for pressure ulcers in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in critically ill children aged 2 months to 17 years shows that use of a manuka honey dressing reduces the median time to complete healing of pressure ulcers by approximately 2 days when compared with standard wound care. In addition, complete healing was about 1.9 times more likely in children given the honey dressing. However, there were no differences in the proportion of children with complete healing or treatment failure, or in the duration of stay in the ICU or hospital (105229).\nless\nPruritus. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for pruritus due to intertrigo.\nPreliminary clinical research shows in adults with intertrigo that applying a honey cream (Medihoney Barrier Cream, Derma Sciences, Inc.) topically twice daily for 21 days reduces pruritus complaints when compared with zinc oxide ointment (55258).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for treating radiation dermatitis.\nClinical research shows that applying honey gauze (HoneySoft) once daily to radiation-induced skin wounds does not increase the speed of wound healing when compared with paraffin gauze in patients with severe radiation-induced dermatitis (55105).\nless\nRadiation-induced esophagitis. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for radiation-induced esophagitis.\nIn patients with radiation esophagitis, preliminary clinical research shows that taking liquid manuka honey 10 mL or honey lozenges providing 10 mL of dehydrated manuka honey four times daily for 4 weeks does not improve pain on swallowing when compared with standard supportive care. However, only 14% of patients using liquid honey reported opioid use, compared with 37% of those given only supportive care (97698).\nless\nSinonasal polyposis. It is unclear if intranasal honey is beneficial in patients recovering from surgery for sinonasal polyposis.\nA small clinical study in patients recovering from sinus surgery for nasal polyposis shows that intranasal irrigation with a diluted processed honey spray four times daily starting the day after surgery does not improve healing or reduce polyp recurrence when compared with normal saline irrigation (108528).\nless\nSunburn. Although there is interest in using topical honey for sunburn, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of honey for this purpose.\nTooth extraction. It is unclear if topical honey is beneficial for wound healing after tooth extraction.\nA small clinical study in children that had a tooth extraction shows that applying a thin layer of Iranian Kurdistan Mountains honey with a cotton swab and keeping the swab in place for 45 minutes seems to reduce wound size more rapidly when compared with using normal saline (103966). The validity of this finding is limited because a large percentage of study participants were excluded from the final analysis.\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. It is unclear if intravaginal honey is beneficial for vaginal candidiasis.\nIn patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, preliminary clinical research shows that applying 5 grams of a vaginal gel containing honey 50% nightly for 8 days is as effective as the same amount of clotrimazole 1% cream for reducing burning and sensitivity and improving culture results. Honey also reduces vaginal discharge in almost twice as many patients as those using clotrimazole (105227).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate honey for these uses.",

It is also standardized to have consistent antibacterial activity (16356, 16370, 16371, 16373). Some authors also state that medical-grade honey should be collected from hives that are free from pathogens and not treated with antibiotics, and that the nectar should be from plants that have not been treated with pesticides (7847).\n\nEye drops and eye gels containing honey have been studied in clinical trials. Evaluated products include eye drops containing manuka honey 16% and eye gel containing manuka honey 98% (Optimel Manuka Plus Eye Drops and Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Gel, Melcare Biomedical Pty Ltd). These products are standardized and approved as medical devices for eye treatment in Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. The gel contains acacia gum 2%.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nHoney from the Black Sea coast of Turkey, which is derived from the nectar of rhododendrons, has been linked with a unique form of poisoning. Honey from this region sometimes contains excessive concentrations of grayanotoxins, which can cause bradycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, hypotension, increased salivation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, weakness, and respiratory depression within a few minutes to several hours after consumption (12220, 55110, 55119, 55126, 55129, 55190, 55238, 55269, 55270, 55280)(55294, 55296). Fatalities have not been reported.\nTreatment\nPoisoning related to honey containing grayanotoxins typically responds to fluids and the reversal of cardiac conduction abnormalities with atropine (12220, 55110, 55126, 55129, 55238, 55269, 55270, 55280).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nClinical research shows that consuming honey 1.5 grams/kg body weight results in the absorption of flavonoids, although less than one-third of flavonoids available in honey appear to be absorbed (93072).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHoney is produced by honeybees of the Apis genus from the nectar of several varieties of plants. It is a supersaturated solution of sugars, of which 38% is fructose and 31% glucose (16363, 16365). Some disaccharides are also present (16363). Honey also contains fatty acids, proteins, and amino acids (16359). Protein content varies from about 160 mg to 550 mg per 100 grams of honey (16365). Enzymes present include saccharase, amylase, and glucose oxidase (16363). A peptide in honey can inhibit polyphenol oxidase and prevent enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables (16365). Organic acids, such as glucuronic acid, account for about 0.57% of honey, and minerals account for 0.17%. Potassium is the most abundant mineral present, with smaller amounts of calcium, copper, iron, manganese, and phosphorus (16363). Vitamins present include ascorbic acid, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, and pyridoxine (16359, 16363). Honey contains polyphenols, such as caffeic acid, quercetin, galangin, and apigenin (55158, 55174, 55223), as well as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (55187). The pharmacological activity of honey can vary depending on the type of plant from which the nectar is obtained. For example, honey produced from poisonous plants can be poisonous.\n\nHoney can be contaminated with microorganisms from plants, bees, and dust during production, and also during collection and processing (16359, 16363). The antibacterial characteristics of honey ensure that most contaminating organisms cannot survive or reproduce (16359, 16363). However, spore-forming organisms such as Clostridium and Bacillus species may remain, and botulism has been reported in infants given honey orally (16359, 16363). Gamma irradiation can be used to inactivate bacterial spores without affecting the antibacterial properties of honey (16355, 16356, 16362, 16370).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome of the benefits of honey in wound healing may be related to its anti-inflammatory effects. There is histological evidence of reduced numbers of inflammatory cells present in wounds dressed with honey (55078). Although some research disagrees (105238), honey appears to reduce elevated levels of inflammatory proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in humans (55136, 105230). The antioxidant effects of honey may also play a role in its anti-inflammatory effects as shown in laboratory research (55138).\nAntimicrobial effects\nHoney has antibacterial and antifungal activity. These effects might help prevent and treat wound infections. Applying 0.5 mL of standardized medical-grade honey (Revamil, Bfactory; available in the Netherlands) to healthy skin under an occlusive dressing for 48 hours reduces skin colonization to very low levels, whereas colonization increases under an occlusive dressing without honey (16373). The antimicrobial potency of different honeys can vary by as much as 100-fold (16360, 16361, 16373). Potency depends upon the geographical and botanical source; the season; and the conditions of harvesting, processing, and storage (16369). Properties of honey which are thought to contribute to these antibacterial effects include osmotic effects of the high sugar content, the low pH, and the presence of glucose oxidase and antibacterial phytochemicals (396, 1261, 1428, 7850, 16356, 16358, 16362, 16363, 16370). The high osmolarity dehydrates bacteria, and the mean pH of 4.4 (range: 3.2 to 5.5) inhibits growth and discourages colonization (16356, 16370). Antibacterial phytochemicals present in some honeys, including manuka honey, have not been fully identified (16362, 16370). In laboratory research, honey appears to impact nitric oxide and prostaglandin levels, which may play an antimicrobial role (55227). Honey is also a prebiotic, with a role in the promotion of Bifidobacterium species in vitro (55072).\n\nIn vitro studies of various honeys have reported inhibition and killing of many organisms including aerobic, anaerobic, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria, and also some fungi and yeasts (16363, 16370, 16373, 55071, 55077, 55242, 55287). The honeys were active against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains, MRSA), Escherichia coli (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, coliform species, Klebsiella species, Enterococci (including vancomycin resistant strains, VRE), Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (1261, 7847, 7849, 16352, 16362, 16363, 16369, 16370, 16373, 55120, 55259, 110002).\n\nThe antibacterial effects of honey may also be beneficial for management of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in peptic ulcer disease. Honey and solutions with similar sugar content demonstrate similar effectiveness at inhibiting H. pylori (1428).\nAntioxidant properties\nHoney varieties have antioxidant effects, although potency can vary 20-fold between different floral sources (16364, 16365, 16366, 16367). Antioxidant content seems to be higher in darker honeys (16366, 16367). Antioxidants in honey have been demonstrated to be bioavailable, increasing plasma total phenolics, and plasma antioxidant and reducing capacities (16366, 16367, 55087). Also, antioxidant effects of honey have been shown in various laboratory models (55069, 55078, 55138). Constituents of honey responsible for the antioxidant effects include phenolic compounds, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoid-like substances, peptides, enzymes, and organic acids (16365, 16366, 16367). The phenolic compounds vary between different types of honey, but include 4-hydroxybenzoic and 4-hydroxycinnamic acids, coumaric acid, and abscisic acid (16365, 16366, 16367). Flavonoids identified in honey include pinobanksin, pinocembrin, chrysin, and galangin (16365, 16367). The ascorbic acid content is generally low (around 5 mg per 100 grams of honey) and may be lost during processing (16365).\nAntitumor activity\nIn surgery for some types of malignant cancer, cells from the tumor can become seeded in the wound margins during excision, resulting in growth of the cancer in the wound. Preliminary evidence from animal models suggests that honey can reduce the growth of these tumors, by impeding the seeding or inhibiting the growth of these cancer cells (7852). Also, animal research shows that honey may help reduce tumor volume (55082). Mechanisms of action may involve the promotion of apoptosis, or cancer cell death (55082).\nAntitussive effects\nIt is suggested that the beneficial effect of honey on coughs is due to its pleasant taste, which causes reflex salivation and promotes secretion of airway mucus to increase lubrication. The sweet taste may also promote production of endogenous opioids (16351).\nDermatologic effects\nTopical honey is of interest for atopic dermatitis. In vitro, manuka honey inhibits mast cell histamine release, as well as the induced secretion of a protein (CCL26) which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease from keratinocytes (105239).\nGlycemic effects\nSome clinical research suggests that consuming honey modestly decreases fasting and postprandial blood glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) when compared to other sources of sugar in patients with or without diabetes (55087, 55090, 55136, 55150, 55263, 55268, 101037). However, there is also some evidence that honey can increase HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes (55182). Laboratory research suggests that the fructose and oligosaccharide constituents of honey can help stimulate insulin release and/or uptake of glucose (55240, 55243). It is unclear as to whether the effects of honey on the glycemic index are dependent on the type of honey used or the fructose to glucose ratios (55104, 55179, 101040). In humans, the glycemic index of different types of Greek honey was negatively correlated to the ratios of sucrose to oligosaccharides or fructose to glucose, as well as the actual content of sucrose or fructose (101040).\nHormonal effects\nHoney may help reduce symptoms of menopause, possibly due to hormonal effects. In animal research, a type of honey called Tualang honey improved the health of the uterus, vaginal cells, and tibia bones in the legs. The honey also reduced body weight. It is possible that these benefits were due to effects of the honey on hormone levels; estradiol and progesterone levels were lower, and testosterone levels were higher than animals of this model not treated with honey (91371).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using honey for beneficial metabolic effects. Eating honey instead of sugar might increase satiety and reduce overconsumption of calories and unhealthy fats. A small clinical study in healthy patients shows that eating clover honey increases satiety and reduces calorie, carbohydrate, and saturated fat consumption, when compared with consuming an isocaloric amount of sucrose (103960).\nPrebiotic effects\nIn premature infants, adding a medical-grade honey to formula increased levels of probiotic bacteria in the gut, including bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. It is not clear if this probiotic effect produced a clinical benefit (97697).\nWound healing effects\nHoney is thought to help in wound healing by several mechanisms. It provides a protective barrier due to its viscosity, and prevents adhesion of dressings to wounds (16354, 16355). It maintains a moist healing environment, encouraging epithelialization and reducing scarring, and may provide nutrients for the wound healing process (16354, 16355). Increased rates of angiogenesis, granulation, and epithelialization have been reported (16356, 16360). Enzymes and hydrogen peroxide in honey can aid in debridement (395, 396, 399, 7849, 16355, 16356). It also draws lymph into the wound by osmosis, which helps to flush bacteria and debris out of the wound (16355, 16356).\n\nThe low pH of honey, with a mean of 4.4, reduces the activity of proteases, which destroy growth factors and protein fibers produced during the wound healing process (16356). Glucose oxidase, a compound in honey, produces gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the wound (16364, 16356). This hydrogen peroxide is released continuously in very low concentrations which are sufficient to produce antibacterial effects, but do not seem to cause the tissue damage associated with topical application of hydrogen peroxide solutions (16355). Since glucose oxidase is destroyed by heat and light, the ability of honey to generate hydrogen peroxide can be lost during processing or aging (16368). Honeys from different botanical sources also vary in hydrogen peroxide production; for example, manuka honey generates very little hydrogen peroxide (16364, 16369).\n\nHoney can prevent and remove odors associated with wounds, probably because bacteria use its sugars for energy, producing lactic acid instead of the ammonia, amines, and sulfur compounds produced when proteins from dead cells and serum are metabolized for energy (16354, 16355). Also, applying honey has been shown to improve bacterial clearance from the wound (101032).\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that honey has anti-inflammatory activity, increases the activity of phagocytes, causes B- and T-lymphocyte proliferation, and can stimulate monocytes and macrophages to produce cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 1 and 6, which play a role in wound healing (16359, 16360, 16362, 16363, 55078, 55084). A non-protein component has been isolated from manuka honey (produced with nectar from Leptospermum scoparium), which binds to TLR4 receptors on monocytes, but it has not been fully identified (16359)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of honeysuckle are the flower, seed, berry, and leaf. Honeysuckle contains essential oils, saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolics, and other compounds including daidzen, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, loganin, linalool, d-limonene, quercetin, kaempferol, chlorogenic acid and macranthoidin B (12604, 12608, 106515, 112868, 112869, 112871). The most abundant polyphenolic constituents in honeysuckle berry extract include chlorogenic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and quercetin (106515).\nAnalgesic effects\nHoneysuckle is traditionally used for pain. Animal research shows honeysuckle flower essential oil decreases the pain response to painful stimuli such as heat and acids at least as well as analgesic medications (112869).\nAnti-bacterial effects\nHoneysuckle is traditionally used for treating bacterial infections. In vitro research shows honeysuckle dried powder extract, as well as constituents luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol, inhibit Bacillus cereus and appear to do so by destroying the bacterial cell wall and membrane (112871).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHoneysuckle is traditionally used orally and topically for inflammatory illnesses. In vitro, the honeysuckle flavonoid, luteolin, inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 production in intestinal cells, suggesting it might be useful for intestinal inflammatory disorders (12605). An aqueous extract of honeysuckle also seems to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of inflammation (12606). The loniceroside saponins of honeysuckle appear to have anti-inflammatory activity (12607).\nAnti-oxidant effects\nSome of the potential beneficial effects of honeysuckle may be attributed to anti-oxidant and free radical scavenging effects. In vitro research shows honeysuckle flower essential oil to exhibit anti-oxidant activity; particularly free radical scavenging activity (112869). Other research in mice with atopic dermatitis found oral honeysuckle extract to reduce reactive oxygen species (112870).\nAntiviral effects\nHoneysuckle is traditionally used for viral illnesses such as influenza, swine flu, and pneumonia. In vitro research suggests that tannins from honeysuckle might inhibit reverse transcriptase activity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (12609). Additional animal and in vitro studies show that honeysuckle extracts can inhibit the replication of influenza viruses, including H1N1, H3N2, and oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strains, through inhibition of viral neuraminidase, thereby suppressing the release of influenza virus from host cells (106514).\nContraceptive effects\nTraditionally, honeysuckle is used as a contraceptive. Honeysuckle might have contraceptive activity by inhibiting implantation, similar to oral contraceptives (12612).\nDermatologic effects\nAnimal research shows that honeysuckle extract improves atopic dermatitis. In mice with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis, oral honeysuckle extract reduced skin lesions, inhibited skin hyperplasia, and reduced mast cell number, reactive oxygen species, levels of immunoglobulin E, interleukin-17, thymic stromal lymphoprotein, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation (112870).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using honeysuckle to prevent liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Animal research shows that honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea) berry extract has hepatoprotective effects, possibly through antioxidant effects and by increasing hepatic glucose enzyme activity and upregulating genes involved in lipid metabolism (103878).\nLipid effects\nIn vitro research shows that polyphenols extracted from honeysuckle reduce the expression of fatty acid synthase and increase phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, important enzymes in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. This might lead to an inhibition of lipid accumulation in adipocytes (106515).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research shows an ointment with honeysuckle flower essential oil 1% and 2% concentration to improve lacerated skin wound healing better than standard treatment (112869). Analysis indicates this may be due to the essential oil-induced increase in hydroxyproline levels, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization in the healing skin."

P57 is an oxypregnane glycoside (12002, 91606), and is thought to act centrally to stimulate sensations of satiety (55322). The precise mechanism is not known. Preliminary unpublished evidence suggests that overweight men who consume P57 have significantly lower calorie intake than those on placebo (12004). Other preliminary research suggests that another constituent of hoodia, gordonoside F, is responsible for the anorexant effects of hoodia. Evidence from animal research shows that gordonoside F, a steroid glycoside, activates GPR119, a receptor expressed in pancreatic beta cells and intestinal L cells. In mice, this activation suppresses appetite by increasing insulin secretion (91614). P57 does not appear to activate GPR119, suggesting that if it is also an active constituent, it works via a different mechanism (91614)."

Although there is interest in using oral hops for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hops for this condition.\nBody odor. Although there is interest in using topical hops to reduce body odor, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hops for this purpose.\nDyspepsia. Although there is interest in using oral hops-derived bitter acids for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hops for this condition.\nInsomnia. Taking oral hops extract in combination with valerian root extract seems to be modestly beneficial in patients with insomnia. However, the effect of hops extract when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with diagnosed sleep disorders, taking hops extract in combination with valerian root for at least 28 days seems to be beneficial. One clinical study in adults with mild insomnia shows that taking two tablets of a combination product containing a total of 83.8 mg hops extract and 374 mg valerian root extract nightly seems to modestly improve subjective sleep measures, including sleep latency, when compared with placebo, after 28 days. However, there was no difference in efficacy between treatment groups after only 14 days (15018). Additionally, a small clinical study in patients with non-organic sleep disorders shows that taking a specific fixed combination product (Ze91019) containing hops extract 120 mg and valerian root extract 500 mg daily for 28 days improves sleep latency when compared with placebo (19413).\n\nIt is unclear if taking hops and valerian root as a single dose is beneficial in healthy patients. One small clinical study in healthy volunteers with poor sleep shows that taking a specific preparation (Dormeasan, Bioforce AG) containing hops extract 460 mg and valerian root extract 460 mg dissolved in 50 mL of honey water once at night increases total sleep time and time spent in deep sleep when compared with placebo (19418). However, another preliminary clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of a specific product (Hova, Zyma S.A.) containing hops extract 200 mg and valerian root extract 400 mg does not improve sleep latency when compared with placebo (6248).\n\nResearch also shows that taking certain combination products containing hops and at least two other ingredients can improve sleep quality. These combination products have combined hops with lemon balm and valerian (Valerina Natt) (19417); or passionflower and valerian (NSF-3, M/s Tablets India) (88193, 89406). However, other combination products have not been beneficial. These have combined hops with soya oil, soya lecithin, and cannabis (Cyclamax, Persee Medica) (55382); or with vitamin B6, zizyphus extract, hydrolyzed milk protein (Lactium), and magnesium oxide (LZ Complex3, Sanofi) (95971).\nless\nLactation. Although there is interest in using oral hops for increasing lactation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hops for this purpose.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral hops extract is beneficial in patients with menopausal symptoms.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with menopausal symptoms show that taking a specific hops extract (MenoHop, Biodynamics) 75.1-300 mg standardized to contain 100-200 mcg of 8-prenylnaringenin daily does not improve menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, after 8-12 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo (55338, 55370).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if administering bitter hops extract intraduodenally or intragastrically is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nA very small clinical study in healthy young adult males shows that intraduodenal or intragastric administration of bitter hops extract 100-250 mg once does not affect appetite perception, gastrointestinal symptoms, or subsequent energy intake when compared with control (112233). It is unclear if these results are generalizable to individuals with overweight or obesity.\nless\nOveractive bladder. Oral hops extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn observational study in females with overactive bladder suggests that taking a specific combination product (Granu Fink femina, Omega Pharma) containing hops extract 18 mg, sweet sumac bark extract 56 mg, and pumpkin seed oil 227 mg three times daily for 12 weeks decreases the frequency of urination from an average of 0.9 to 0.4 episodes daily and the frequency of leakage when compared with baseline. The study also shows this specific combination product (Granu Fink femina, Omega Pharma) improves quality of life when compared with baseline (103253). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Also, it is unclear if these findings are due to hops extract, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if drinking non-alcoholic beer containing matured hops bitter acids is beneficial in healthy adults.\nA clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming 350 mL of non-alcoholic beer containing matured hops bitter acids 35 mg (Kirin Holdings Co. Ltd) daily for 3 weeks improves mood scores on the Profile of Mood States 2 (POMS2) and Two-dimensional Mood Scale (TDMS) when compared with baseline (107813). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if topical hops gel is beneficial in patients with postmenopausal vaginal atrophy.\nA small clinical study in adults with postmenopausal vaginal atrophy shows that applying intravaginal topical gel containing hops extract (Barij Essence) daily for 7 days and then twice weekly thereafter for 2 months does not improve sexual desire, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication, satisfaction, orgasm, sexual pain, or overall measures of sexual dysfunction when compared with intravaginal estradiol (112125). The validity of these effects is limited by baseline differences between groups.\nless\nShift work disorder. It is unclear if drinking non-alcoholic beer containing hops is beneficial in patients with shift work disorder.\nA small open-label clinical study in healthy female nurses working rotating or night shifts shows that drinking 333 mL of non-alcoholic beer containing hops (San Miguel 0% alcohol) at dinner for 2 weeks reduces sleep latency by about 8 minutes, total activity during the night, andanxiety when compared with baseline. However, it does not appear to increase the duration of sleep (55403). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group and unconfirmed hops content in the beer.\nless\nVaginal atrophy. Topical hops extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn open-label, multicenter clinical study in postmenopausal patients with vaginal atrophy shows that inserting 2.5 grams of a vaginal gel containing hops extract 1%, hyaluronic acid, liposomes, and vitamin E (Gynomunal Vaginal gel or Esvegyne, Polichem SA) into the vagina daily for one week followed by twice weekly for 11 weeks reduces vaginal dryness, burning, itching, and rash when compared with baseline (55339). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to hops, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Although there is interest in using topical hops for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of hops for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate hops for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with hops.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nA small clinical study in healthy females shows that taking a hops extract containing xanthohumol 2 mg, isoxanthohumol 1.2 mg, and 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN) 0.1 mg three times daily for 5 days results in the following mean serum concentrations: xanthohumol, 5 nmol/L; isoxanthohumol, 14.9 nmol; and 8-PN, 2.2 nmol (55380). Absorption of hops constituents is described as \"slow\" and is affected by the demethylation of isoxanthohumol into 8-PN by intestinal microbiota in the distal colon (55380, 105954).\nDistribution\nWhen taken orally, the hops constituents xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 8-PN appear to be distributed to glandular tissue, adipose/glandular tissue, and adipose breast tissue in healthy females (55380).\nMetabolism\nThe hops constituents xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 8-PN appear to primarily undergo phase II metabolism and partially undergo phase I metabolism. Phase I metabolism includes demethylation of isoxanthuhumol to 8-PN. Phase II conjugation results in monoglucuronides, monosulfates, diglucuronides, and sulfate-glucuronic acid diconjugates (55380, 105954).\nExcretion\nThe prenylated phenols in hops, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 6-prenylnaringenin, and 8-PN, are reported to have half-lives of more than 20 hours (55380, 105954).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of hops is the dried, female flowering part (strobile), also known as the cone. Hops contain several flavonoids including the isoprenylated chalcone xanthohumol, the isoprenylated flavanone isoxanthohumol, and others flavonoids such as 6-prenylnaringenin (6-PN), 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), quercetin, rutin, and astragalin (10683, 97014). Xanthohumol occurs at levels of 0.1% to 1% in the lupulin, also known as the hops resin. Hops also contain bitter acids, or iso-alpha acids (IAAs), which contribute to its bitter flavor. When oxidized, the alpha- and beta-acids found in hops convert to matured hops bitter acids, which have similar chemical structures to IAAs and include 4'-hydroxyallohumulinones, 4'-hydroxyalloisohumulones, tricyclooxyisohumulones A, hulupones, and humulinones (102899, 105953).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that xanthohumol in hops has anti-inflammatory activity (14384). Xanthohumol appears to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of the inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-alpha, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in a human monocytic cell line and mouse macrophages (55355, 55372). Xanthohumol also appears to inhibit LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and the cytokines IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in a mouse-derived brain (microglial) cells (55390).\n\nHumulon, another constituent of hops, has also shown anti-inflammatory activity in animal research. Humulon can inhibit ear inflammation caused by arachidonic acid in mice (55409).\n\nHops bitter acids, including alpha-acids, beta-acids, and iso-alpha acids, have also shown anti-inflammatory activity. Hops bitter acids blocked TNF-alpha-induced production of IL-6 and inhibited the transactivation of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-kappaB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and cAMP-response element-binding protein in fibroblast cells. This anti-inflammatory effect was independent of glucocorticoid receptor-alpha and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha or -gamma (55356). Other in vitro research suggests that rho-iso-alpha acids from hops can inhibit LPS-induced production of nitric oxide in macrophage cells, as well as reduce collagen-induced arthritis in an animal model (55357).\n\nIn humans, hops extract decreases complement C3 fraction, C-reactive protein levels, and IL-6 levels (55418).\nAntiangiogenic effects\nIn vitro and ex vivo studies suggests that the hops constituent xanthohumol and its metabolite isoxanthohumol reduce blood vessel formation, while the xanthohumol metabolite 8-prenylnaringenin stimulates angiogenesis (55385).\nAnticancer effects\nXanthohumol is thought to have several pharmacological effects, including potential anticancer activity (34008). Preliminary research suggests that xanthohumol inhibits metabolic activation of food-borne carcinogens and induces phase II enzymes involved metabolizing or detoxifying potentially harmful xenobiotics (14384, 55324). Xanthohumol and xanthohumol D have also been identified as ligands of quinone reductase-2, which is a target for chemopreventive drugs (55394).\n\nIn addition to its chemopreventive effects, there is interest in hops and the xanthohumol constituent for prostate cancer. In vitro research suggests that xanthohumol and a derivative can induce apoptosis in benign prostate hyperplasia and malignant prostate cancer cells (14386, 55374). These constituents seem to activate pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and p53. The constituents also seem to decrease activation of NF-kappaB (14386, 55387). Similarly, xanthohumol appears to inhibit the proliferation of liver cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity (55367).\n\nSome preliminary evidence suggests that hops might possess antiproliferative properties, indicating potential chemoprevention against breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer (10683, 55345). One mechanism suggested includes the inhibition of the P450 enzymes that activate carcinogens (9990, 10686, 97014). Additional laboratory research shows that the hops constituent 6-prenylnaringenin induces the estrogen 2-hydroxylation pathway. This pathway has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk, possibly through a detoxification effect (97014).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal models of diabetes and obesity, xanthohumol activates the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and improves lipid and glucose metabolism (14384). Isohumulones, which are bitter acids derived from hops, have been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-gamma in vitro and reduce insulin resistance in diabetic mice (55330). However, other animal research shows that hops does not affect glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice (37425). Other animal research suggests that colupulone, another hops constituent, can actually elevate serum glucose levels in diabetic mice (55410, 55412).\nAntimicrobial effects\nEssential oils and extracts of hops have shown antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, five strains of acne-causing bacteria, and one species of fungi in vitro (55328, 55342, 55427, 55428). Some research attributes the antibacterial effects of hops to its weak acid derivatives, including trans-isohumulone, humulone, colupulone, and trans-humulinic acid (55329). Tetrahydroiso-alpha acids have also shown antibacterial effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro (55358).\n\nSome research has investigated the antiviral potential of the hops constituent xanthohumol. In vitro research shows that xanthohumol can enhance the antiviral effect of interferon-alpha-2b against bovine viral diarrhea virus, a surrogate of the hepatitis C virus, suggesting its potential benefit when used along with anti-hepatitis C regimens (55360).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research suggests that xanthohumol in hops has antioxidant effects (14384, 55342). Hops chalcones with alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone functionality have been shown to inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (55326). Also, extract from hops cones has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in blood platelets, similar to that of resveratrol (55396).\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) effects\nIn vitro research suggests that flavonoid constituents of hops can significantly inhibit CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 enzyme activity (10686), while other in vitro research suggests that a specific constituent of hops, 6-PN, can induce CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzyme activity (97014). However, research in humans suggests that hops extract does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP enzymes. A pharmacokinetic study in healthy postmenopausal patients with normal metabolism shows that taking an extract of spent hops 59.5 mg (containing 8-PN 0.25 mg, 6-PN 1.30 mg, isoxanthohumol 0.80 mg, and xanthohumol 21.3 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks does not alter the metabolism of CYP1A2, 2C9, or 2D6 substrates. The exposure to the probe substrates tolbutamide, caffeine, and dextromethorphan was not affected by hops extract. Also, the area under the curve for alprazolam, a probe substrate of CYP3A4, decreased by 7.6%, suggesting a clinically insignificant induction of CYP3A4 (105954).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro, hops extracts, xanthohumol, and the lupulones have shown strong inhibitory activities against five strains of acne-causing bacteria (55342). The hops constituents xanthohumol, humulones, and lupulones also appear to inhibit collagenase activity, suggesting that these constituents reduce collagen degradation (55342). The hops constituent xanthohumol also appears to inhibit elastase and matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes which contribute to the deterioration of collagen and elastin associated with skin aging. This constituent also increases the production of collagen, elastin, and fibrillin in the skin, which may improve skin structure and firmness (55378).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA very small clinical study in healthy young adult males shows that intraduodenal administration of bitter hop extract 250 mg modestly stimulates peptide YY but does not affect antropyloroduodenal pressures, cholecystokinin, appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, or energy intake when compared with control. Additionally, no effects were seen when bitter hops extract was administered intraduodenally at a lower dose of 100 mg or when administered intragastrically (112233).\nHematologic effects\nLaboratory and animal research suggests that spent hops extract, as well as the hops constituent xanthohumol, inhibits whole blood platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The mechanism of action appears to be related to the reduced expression of both P-selectin and activated GPIIB/IIIa (97015).\nHepatic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that the hops constituent xanthohumol reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis in mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (55368). However, xanthohumol does not appear to protect liver tissue from ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat liver (55361).\nHormonal effects\nThe hops flavonoids 8-PN and isoxanthohumol are thought to have weak estrogenic activity (10684, 10685, 34032, 55336). The 8-PN flavonoid is reported to have a similar or even greater estrogen-binding capacity as the isoflavone genistein, which is found in soy (11093, 105954). The 8-PN flavonoid binds to both alpha- and beta-estrogen receptors, but with a higher affinity for the beta-estrogen receptor. Hops extract also appears to competitively bind to estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta (9998). Furthermore, an extract of hops has been reported to competitively inhibit estradiol binding to estrogen receptors and induce transcription in estrogen-responsive cells (6180).\n\nHops also seem to decrease luteinizing hormone levels in female rats that have had their ovaries removed (6180).\n\nSome hops flavonoids inhibit aromatase in vitro. The most potent aromatase inhibitor is 8-PN, followed by xanthohumol and isoxanthohumol respectively (14385). This suggests that these compounds might have some antiestrogenic activity as well as estrogenic activity.\n\nLaboratory research shows that the hops constituent 6-PN induces the estrogen 2-hydroxylation pathway, which has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk, possibly through a detoxification effect. 6-PN also upregulates cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and 1B1 in breast cells, two enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism (97014).\nImmune effects\nIn vitro, xanthohumol from hops appears to inhibit T cell proliferation, the development of IL-2 activated killer (LAK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and the production of various Th1 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. This effect appears to be mediated through the suppression of NF-kappaB (55351). This suggests a potential immunosuppressive effect.\nLibido effects\nHops extract appears to have gender-specific libido effects. In hormone-primed female rats, hops extract has been shown to increase the preference for the stimulus male in a partner preference test and the number of proceptive behaviors in a receptivity test, without affecting the lordosis (swayback) response (55395). In naïve male rats, however, hops extract exerted an aphrodisiac effect by inhibiting mounting and ejaculating behavior (55352).\nSedative effects\nMouse models have found hops to have sedative and hypnotic properties (55415). In mice, hops extracts showed a dose-dependent reduction of locomotor activity and an increase in narcotic-induced sleep duration (55340). The sedative effect was attributed to alpha-bitter acids and, to a lesser extent, beta-bitter acids and hops oil. Other animal models have found the hops alpha-acid 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol diminishes animal motility by 50% when given intraperitoneally (55406, 55407, 55408). The effects of this hops constituent were found to be similar to the sedative drug methylpentynol. In fresh hops, there are only traces of this constituent, but the concentration of 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol has been shown by other studies to continuously increase after drying, reaching maximum levels (approximately 0.15%) within two years of storage at room temperature. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of this compound may be acquired in both tea and bath preparations (55429).\nThyroid effects\nIn rats, xanthohumol, a hops constituent, modulated hepatic expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone distribution and metabolism (55379).\nWeight loss effects\nA small clinical crossover study in 19 males with a healthy weight shows that taking a supercritical carbon dioxide hops cone extract (Amarasate, Plant & Food Research Ltd.) 500 mg, either in delayed-release capsules intended for duodenal delivery or in quick-release capsules intended for gastric delivery, prior to lunch reduces ad libitum energy intake in total and when snacking, but not at lunch, when compared with placebo (107812)."

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with hordenine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn vitro research shows that hordenine is a selective substrate for monoamine oxidase-B in the liver, but it is not deaminated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). This suggests that hordenine is not likely to be deaminated in the gut, increasing the likelihood for absorption when compared with tyramine, a structurally similar compound that is deaminated by MAO-A in the intestine (27943). However, preliminary research shows that there is high variability in hordenine pharmacokinetics, with low oral bioavailability. In humans, after consuming beer providing hordenine 0.075 mg/kg, peak hordenine levels of around 15 nM occur at 30-90 minutes (103277). In young, healthy males, taking 100 mg of hordenine orally on an empty stomach results in a mean maximum plasma concentration of 16.4 mcg/L at 65 minutes (110674).\nDistribution\nHordenine crosses the blood-brain barrier in humans (110674).\nMetabolism\nHordenine undergoes rapid and extensive sulfation and glucuronidation, producing hordenine sulfate and hordenine glucuronide (103277, 110674).\nExcretion\nIn young, healthy males, the half-life of free hordenine averages 54 minutes (110674). The half-lives for hordenine sulfate and hordenine glucuronide are around 115 minutes and 135 minutes, respectively (103277).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHordenine gets its name from barley (Hordeum vulgare); it is formed in the roots during germination of barley grains (19513, 29814, 90338, 103276, 103277, 110674). It has also been identified as a constituent in a variety of algae, cacti, grasses, and other plants.\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that hordenine may have antimicrobial effects at high concentrations. Bacteria communicate and coordinate gene expression through \"quorum-sensing\" regulatory pathways. In vitro, hordenine has been shown to inhibit these pathways in Agrobacterium tumefacians and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88316).\nCardiovascular effects\nVarious in vitro and animal studies have evaluated the effect of hordenine on the cardiovascular system. Some data show that hordenine inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and might also cause release of norepinephrine stores in some tissues ( 11136,91721). However, it may have less adrenergic activity in some tissues compared to the endogenous amines tyramine and N-methyltyramine (91721). In vitro and animal research shows that high dose hordenine can cause short-lived increases in heart rate and blood pressure when given intravenously (11136, 27943, 29021). The cardiovascular impact was not observed in animals when given orally (29021); however, the reason for this is unclear.\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that hordenine may have depigmentation effects. It appears to do this by inhibiting a variety of proteins and pathways involved in melanogenesis (88342).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research shows that hordenine stimulates gastrin release, which can increase gastric acid secretion in the stomach (29841). Additional animal research shows that high-dose hordenine causes short-lived inhibition of gut motility (11136).\nRespiratory effects\nAnimal research in horses shows that IV hordenine 2 mg/kg increases respiratory rate by 250% whereas oral administration of hordenine 2 mg/kg does not increase respiratory rate (29021)."

When added to conventional therapy, horny goat weed appears to have a large effect on BMD, while its effect is more modest when used alone. The most common formulations and doses used include granules 1 gram twice daily for 6 months, an extract 600 mg taken in divided doses daily for 6 months, and a decoction 50 mL taken 2-3 times daily for 3-6 months. The pooled analysis suggests that horny goat weed decoctions are more effective than other formulations (109578).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe horny goat weed constituent icariin is absorbed in the duodenum and ileum. Epimedin C is primarily absorbed in the duodenum (55472). In rat research, peak plasma levels of icariin and other constituents of interest occur approximately 23-25 minutes after oral intake of horny goat weed (112706).\nMetabolism\nPeak plasma levels of the icariin metabolite, icariside II, occur about 4 hours after oral intake of horny goat weed. The accumulation of the desmethylicaritin metabolite is biphasic, with small and large peaks occurring after 5 and 24 hours, respectively. Peak levels last for up to 48 hours (100066).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of the icariin metabolite icariside II after oral intake of horny goat weed is 12-15 hours (100066).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of horny goat weed are the leaves and stems (11, 12). Active constituents include the flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, breviflavone, epimedokoreanin B, baohuoside I, hyperoside, and epimedin B and C (16064, 55449, 55455, 97268, 100067). Horny goat weed also contains the phytoestrogens icariin, genistein, daidzein, desmethylicaritin, and icaritin, as well as the lignan syringaresinol (14900, 16060, 16061, 16063, 16064, 55436, 55444, 100067). Other constituents include anhydroicaritin, icariside II, maohuoside A, saggittatoside A, salidroside, syringin, polysaccharides, sesquiterpenes, glycosides, ceryl alcohol, essential oils, and fatty acids (97268). The most abundant compound found in horny goat weed is icariin, a glycoside formed from the prenylflavonoid icaritin plus glucose and rhamnose. It constitutes up to 6.5% of the dry weight of an ethanolic extract of horny goat weed (97268).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHorny goat weed is traditionally used for many conditions that involve cellular inflammatory processes, including arthritis and hepatitis. In laboratory research, horny goat weed extract inhibited proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, nitric oxide, and eicosanoids (100067).\nAntiaging effects\nIn vitro research shows that horny goat weed can accelerate the rate of DNA synthesis and prolong the lifespan of aging youth 2BS fusion cells, which are used as an aging model (52487).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that icariin, a constituent of horny goat weed, can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of tumor cells (55433, 55449). Other constituents of horny goat weed, including luteolin, epimedokoreanin B, and baohuoside I, have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (55449). Other in vitro research shows that horny goat weed extract can inhibit the proliferation of hepatoma and leukemia cell lines. However, icariin does not appear to inhibit the proliferation of these cells lines, suggesting that it may not be the active anticancer constituent (13647).\nAntioxidant effects\nIcariin, a constituent of horny goat weed, has been shown to have antioxidant activity (55438, 55447). Other constituents of horny goat weed, including luteolin, hyperoside, and epimedokoreanin B, have been shown to scavenge DPPH radicals (55449).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that horny goat weed might have activity against HIV (1512, 52886).\nBone effects\nA number of compounds in horny goat weed are thought to target estrogen signaling and other bone formation pathways in osteoblasts. They also target mesenchymal stem cells, and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, proliferation, and functioning (97268). The icariin constituent of horny goat weed stimulates human osteoblasts by upregulating bone morphogenic protein-2 (16065, 16067, 55445). Clinical research also shows that taking horny goat weed extract increases levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), a marker associated with increased osteoblast function, and decreases levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a marker associated with osteoclast activity (109579). In rodent studies, horny goat weed extract, icariin, and icaritin increase proliferation of osteoblasts. Icariin and icaritin also inhibit osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow cultures (97268).\nCardiovascular effects\nHorny goat weed causes vasodilation, possibly by blocking calcium channels. It also seems to have hypotensive effects, possibly by blocking catecholamines (10346). Laboratory research suggests horny goat weed increases coronary blood flow and decreases platelet aggregation (10346, 105832). Other laboratory research shows that horny goat weed extract reduces homocysteine levels by inhibiting S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase in hepatic cells. Theoretically, this effect may offer cardioprotective benefit (16066).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nIn vitro, an ethanol extract of horny goat weed leaves inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and 2B6 in human liver microsomes but does not affect the activity of CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 (97267). However, other in vitro research suggests that horny goat weed extract inhibits CYP3A4 and suppresses CYP3A4 mRNA expression (112708).\nGenitourinary effects\nThe icariin constituent of horny goat weed inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and enhances cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in cavernous smooth muscle cells (16062).\nHepatic effects\nTheoretically, icariin may have hepatoprotective effects (55465, 112705). Icariin, a constituent of horny goat weed, appears to attenuate increased levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase and sorbitol dehydrogenase released from hepatocytes exposed to carbon tetrachloride (55465). Also, a study in rats induced with polycystic ovary syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease suggests that exposure to icariin daily for 28 days improves fatty acid oxidation and reduces accumulation of fat within the liver when compared with control (112705). Conversely, rat research of a specific species of horny goat weed, Epimedium koreanum Nakai, is associated with increases in liver weight, liver function tests, and fat within liver cells when compared with control after 28 days of daily exposure. These findings are associated with risk of liver toxicity through ferrous-driven cell death (112704).\nHormonal effects\nThe glycosides in horny goat weed might have hormonal effects. Animal research suggests that horny goat weed promotes semen secretion and stimulates growth of prostate, testes, and anus rector muscles. Some researchers think it might increase testosterone secretion (10346).\n\nHorny goat weed and its constituents icaritin, desmethylicaritin, breviflavone B, kaempferol, apigenin, quercetin, and luteolin have estrogenic activity in vitro (16060, 16061, 16063, 16064, 55444). It is a strong activator of estrogen receptors; however, it does not seem to affect androgen receptors (16064, 55444). Some data indicate that horny goat weed leaf extract increases estrogen activity at low doses, but inhibits it at higher doses (97268). Additionally, a study in rats induced with polycystic ovary syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease suggests that exposure to horny goat weed daily for 28 days reduces levels of testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (112705).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn patients undergoing hemodialysis, treatment with horny goat weed appears to normalize levels of both soluble IL-2 receptor and IL-6, as well as improving activity of IL-2, suggesting that it may help restore immune function in patients who are immunodeficient (55457, 55459). Also, animal research shows that horny goat weed dried leaf extract, as well as the horny goat weed constituents icariin and epimedin C, can activate phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells in the liver. This suggests horny goat weed may stimulate the innate immune system (55455).\n\nBaohuoside I, a flavonoid isolated from horny goat weed, appears to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and suppress T cell activation in vitro. This suggests immunosuppressant activity (55443).\nNeurologic effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that syringaresinol, a constituent of horny goat weed, might increase the formation of neurites (55436)."

The patient was treated with steroid therapy for 2 months, as well as colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600 mg twice daily for 3 months. These cardiovascular events were considered to be possibly related to the antiplatelet activity of horse chestnut or to an immunologic response to antigens present in horse chestnut paste (91972). A case of atrial fibrillation is also reported in a previously healthy 46-year-old male after accidental ingestion of a horse chestnut seed. The patient also presented with abdominal pain, nausea, sweating, and palpitations. The arrhythmia resolved within a few hours without medical intervention (110439).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, horse chestnut seed extract has been reported to cause pruritus (282, 12113, 55486).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, horse chestnut seed extract has been reported to cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, gastrointestinal upset, and dyspepsia (282, 12113, 55477, 55486, 55493, 55520, 110439).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, there is one case report of hepatotoxicity in a 69-year-old female who took 6-15 tablets of a specific product (Venencapsan) containing horse chestnut leaf, milfoil, celandine, sweet clover, milk thistle, and dandelion root daily for 6 weeks. The patient's symptoms disappeared 6 weeks after discontinuing the product and reappeared following re-initiation (55518). Another case report describes a 70-year-old male presenting with acholia, choluria, and jaundice after 3 weeks of self-treatment with an unspecified dose of a specific combination product (Venenkraft) containing horse chestnut. The patient presented with elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels, and was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury. Following discontinuation, laboratory values and symptoms progressively resolved (107702). In both of these case reports, it is unclear if hepatotoxicity was due to horse chestnut, another ingredient, or the combination.\n\nIntravenously and intramuscularly, isolated cases of liver toxicity have occurred after administration of horse chestnut extract containing aescin (2, 512, 552).\nless\nImmunologic\nPollen from the horse chestnut flower can cause allergic reactions in children (7775). Horse chestnut can also cause hypersensitivity reactions, which occur more commonly in people who are allergic to latex (7853, 8418).\n\nRectally, the horse chestnut constituent esculin has caused severe allergic contact dermatitis and proctitis in a 38-year old man (10383).\n\nIntravenously, administration of aescin can cause anaphylaxis (18, 553).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, calf spasms have been reported in patients with CVI who took horse chestnut seed extract (282).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, horse chestnut seed extract has been reported to cause headache or dizziness (55486, 55520).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, high doses of aescin have been reported to cause kidney toxicity (55525). Horse chestnut seed and bark can cause toxic nephropathy (4). A case of life-threatening kidney rupture occurred in a patient who was taking horse chestnut seed extract and had been diagnosed with angiomyolipoma, a condition characterized by increased risk of kidney rupture with hemorrhage.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of horse chestnut are the seed, bark, flower, and leaf. An extract of horse chestnut seed is most commonly used. Horse chestnut contains triterpene saponins referred to as aescin (escin), as well as the toxic glycoside esculin (aesculin) (11, 55476). Esculin is a hydroxycoumarin (19).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPurified aescin has been shown to decrease chemically-induced inflammation in rats (55513, 55521, 55530).\nAntioxidant effects\nHorse chestnut extract has been reported to have antioxidant effects (55512).\nAntithrombin effects\nHorse chestnut contains the hydroxycoumarin esculin, which may have antithrombin activity and produce toxicity in humans (6048, 20322, 20323). Esculin is found in the bark, buds, and other parts of the fruits, but it should not be present in properly extracted horse chestnut seed extract.\nCardiovascular effects\nEsculin is a hydroxycoumarin, which may increase bleeding time due to antithrombin activity (19). Aescin, a constituent of horse chestnut, decreases the permeability of venous capillaries (55513, 55521). Aescin also increases blood vessel contraction, possibly by increasing the secretion of prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2alpha) from vascular endothelial cells (55476, 55506, 55513). PGF2alpha is involved in promoting blood vessel contraction and facilitating venous return. This may benefit patients with chronic venous insufficiency.\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro, aescin constricts veins and reduces the capillary permeability induced by histamine or serotonin (7162). These properties of the saponin components are the basis for the cosmetic applications of horse chestnut seed extract (4).\nIntestinal effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that saponins, which are found in horse chestnut extract, can promote intestinal motility via antimicrobial effects, and reduce methane production. These may be beneficial in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (95429)."

He experienced vasovagal syncope within 5 minutes of horseradish ingestion but regained consciousness moments later, with few residual symptoms and no medical intervention required. Researchers theorize that the vapors from horseradish can irritate the gastric or respiratory tract mucosa triggering the vaso-vagal response. Horseradish-induced vasovagal syncope has also been referred to as Seder syncope due to the tradition of consuming bitter herbs, including horseradish, during the Jewish Passover holiday dinner.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of horsetail are the above ground parts. Horsetail constituents include petrosins, caffeic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, triterpenoids, sterols, tannins, and saponins (13564, 13565, 13567, 92290, 92293). Horsetail also contains various flavonoids, including equisetumpyrone, genkwanin, protogenkwanin, apigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol and quercetin compounds. Horsetail also contains trace amounts of nicotine (13563, 105300), as well as significant amounts of silicon as silicic acid and silicates (13562, 92290, 108850). In one study, tea prepared from horsetail 25 grams/L was found to contain silicon 200 mg/L; tea prepared from horsetail 250 grams/L was found to contain silicon 750 mg/L (108850).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that horsetail extracts might have analgesic effects. These effects do not appear to be related to the opioid system (13569, 92289).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory and animal research shows that the aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of horsetail have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Flavonoid constituents and other phenolic compounds are thought to play a role. Anti-inflammatory effects appear to be related to a reduction in the function of immune cells (13566, 13568, 13569, 92289, 92290).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nAnimal research suggests that horsetail extracts might have anticonvulsant effects, which decrease the severity and frequency of induced seizures (13566).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory research shows that certain horsetail extracts exhibit antimicrobial effects. Specific extracts appeared to have differential effects against various species of bacteria and fungi (92293).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research shows that the aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of horsetail have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Flavonoid constituents and other phenolic compounds are thought to play a role (13566, 13568, 13569, 92290, 92293).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that horsetail might have antiviral effects (13570).\nDiuretic effects\nAnimal and human research show that various horsetail species demonstrate diuretic properties (13574, 13575, 92288). In clinical research, taking horsetail for four days produced a diuretic effect equivalent to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. However, electrolyte excretion was not affected (92288). The mechanism of this diuretic effect is not entirely clear, but has been attributed to flavonoid, phenolic compounds, and mineral salt constituents of horsetail.\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that the flavonoid and petrosin constituents of horsetail might have hepatoprotective properties (13564).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn human or animal research, Equisetum myriochaetum and Equisetum giganteum have demonstrated hypoglycemic activity (13576, 105300). The mechanism of action is unclear. However, in animal research, Equisetum giganteum did not affect the number or size of pancreatic islets (105300). It is unknown if other species of horsetail have hypoglycemic activity.\nSedative effects\nAnimal research suggests that horsetail extracts might have sedative effects. These effects resulted in increased sleeping time and increased fall rate (13566).\nThiaminase effects\nCrude horsetail contains thiaminase, an enzyme that destroys thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiaminase-containing plants have been associated with neurological toxicity in animals due to thiamine deficiency (13571, 13572, 13573).\nVasorelaxant effects\nLaboratory research suggests that horsetail constituents might have vasorelaxant effects (13565)."

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with hu zhang.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal research, hu zhang given as a single oral dose resulted in increases of both resveratrol and emodin metabolites in the blood, suggesting that hu zhang is absorbed when taken orally (93960).\nDistribution\nIn animal research, a single oral dose of hu zhang extract resulted in resveratrol or its glucuronide/sulfate metabolites in the duodenum, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and stomach (56938, 93960). Emodin metabolites were found in the kidney and lung with free emodin in the liver (93960).\nMetabolism\nFrom animal research it appears that the hu zhang constituents emodin and resveratrol are glucuronidated or sulfated following intake in hu zhang (56938, 93960).\nExcretion\nIn animals, plasma levels of emodin and resveratrol, constituents of hu zhang, were back to normal within approximately 500 minutes and 1000-1500 minutes, respectively, after oral intake of hu zhang (93960). Animal research also suggests that the majority of resveratrol from hu zhang is eliminated in the urine as metabolites within 24 hours. More than 99% of excreted resveratrol is in a metabolized form (56938).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of hu zhang is the root. Hu zhang has several active constituents including emodin, resveratrol, emodin-8-O-D-glucoside, physcion, piceid or polydatin, the anthraquinone malonylglucosides polygonins A and B, flavonoids, and others. Hu zhang is considered to be one of the richest sources of trans-resveratrol (2030, 15154, 93959, 93968, 93969). The hu zhang constituent, emodin, is an anthraquinone, which seems to be responsible for many of hu zhang's potential pharmacological activity.\nAnti-diabetes effects\nHu zhang is traditionally used for diabetes in China. In animal models of diabetes, hu zhang protected against renal cell injury and retinopathy (93962, 93963). It is possible that the constituent emodin helped to protect against the formation of advanced glycation end-products to protect against renal injury (93962). Hu zhang also inhibited the pathway leading to retinal vascular permeability (93963).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHu zhang is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory agent for arthritis and gout. Animal models have shown that hu zhang extract reduces inflammation in various inflammatory models, including arthritis (93969). In humans, hu zhang reduced levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (93967). Laboratory research suggests that hu zhang constituents might inhibit the formation of some inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase end-products (56943). Hu zhang extract and constituents might inhibit inflammatory pathways involving the inducible nitric oxide synthetase and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes (56931, 93969). In an animal model, hu zhang reduced the migration of white blood cells, resulting in reduced inflammation (56936). Thus, it appears that hu zhang and at least some of its constituents have anti-inflammatory effects. There may be more than one mechanism (93969).\nAntiallergic effects\nHu zhang is traditionally used to reduce symptoms of allergies. Laboratory research suggests that hu zhang extract inhibits histamine release and cytokine production from mast cells (56935).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that hu zhang extract has antibacterial effects against various bacteria, including drug-resistant organisms. The extract appears to disrupt the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane (56928, 93964). The constituent emodin also has antibacterial effects (56942). A traditional use of hu zhang is for oral health. This is likely based on the antibacterial effects of hu zhang extract on common oral bacterial (93969).\nAnticancer effects\nHu zhang appears to have several potential anticancer effects. The emodin constituent and other polyphenols such as resveratrol contained in hu zhang seem to have antimutagenic effects. In vitro, hu zhang extracts and emodin decrease the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene and other mutagens in a dose-dependent manner (13122). Several constituents of hu zhang seem to have a cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells. Emodin appears to be the most cytotoxic (13125). The emodin constituent of hu zhang is also a strong inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase (13126, 13128). Tyrosine kinases have a role in regulation of cell growth. Tyrosine kinases are therefore a target for potential anticancer agents (13126). Preliminary evidence also suggests that a hu zhang root extract has antiangiogenesis activity (13129).\n\nIn vitro evidence suggests that a hu zhang extract can increase proliferation of estrogen-sensitive breast tissue cells, MCF-7. The emodin constituent binds both estrogen receptor-alpha and estrogen receptor-beta and is thought to be a potent phytoestrogen (13124).\nAntilipemic effects\nHu zhang extract decreases serum levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol in animal models. Hu zhang seems inhibit acyl-coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which is involved in determining cholesterol levels. The resveratrol constituent of hu zhang is thought to be the constituent primarily responsible for inhibiting ACAT (13123). However, the constituent polydatin has also been shown to reduce levels of cholesterol in an animal model (56941).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of hu zhang might play a role in its potential clinical effects including reduced swelling and inflammation. The antioxidant effects of hu zhang have been shown in various animal and in vitro models (56919, 56932, 93969).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research shows that some constituents of hu zhang, including piceid, emodin, and catechin, have antiviral activity against the HIV virus (93959). Another constituent, a procyanidin-tri-O-gallate, has the potential to reverse HIV viral latency. This suggests the potential for hu zhang to be used in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy to eliminate latent viral reservoirs (93965). Laboratory research also suggests that hu zhang and its constituents such as resveratrol and emodin might inhibit replication of various strains of the influenza virus, including H1N1. Inhibition of interferon-beta appears to play a role in the mechanism of action (93961). Hu zhang extract has also been shown to inhibit the replication of other viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) (56915).\nCardioprotective effects\nAlthough hu zhang has not been investigated for its cardioprotective properties in animals or humans, there is evidence to suggest that two hu zhang constituents, polydatin and resveratrol, have the potential to improve outcomes associated with cardiac perfusion injury. Polydatin reduces free radical injury in laboratory models. It also inhibits the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and prevents ventricular remodeling. Resveratrol also appears to protect the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury and is possibly protective against hypertensive-induced cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis.\nDental effects\nHu zhang has traditionally been used to improve oral hygiene. In vitro research shows that hu zhang rhizome extracts improve measures of human gingival fibroblast viability, proliferation, and migration, suggesting that hu zhang extract might be beneficial for the treatment of gingival wounds (109609).\nEstrogenic effects\nHu zhang extract shows estrogenic activity in laboratory models (16061). This may be related to the constituent emodin, which binds to estrogen receptors and blocks the binding of 17-beta-estradiol to human estrogen receptors (13124, 93969).\nImmune effects\nIn an animal model, hu zhang stimulated an immune response. Hu zhang increased the proliferation of white blood cells and enhanced the activity of both macrophages and natural killer cells (93958).\nLaxative effects\nEmodin, like other anthraquinones, is thought to have a laxative effect (13122).\nNeuroprotective effects\nClinical benefits related to the neuroprotective effects of hu zhang are not clear. In animal models, hu zhang and constituents such as 2-methoxy-6-acetyl-7-methyljuglone, emodin, polydatin, and resveratrol reduced the infarction volume and prevent neurological and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, based on the mechanism of action involving the inhibition of cell adhesion molecule production, hu zhang extract might prevent injury due to stroke. The antioxidant properties of hu zhang constituents appear to play a role in these effects (93969).\nWound healing effects\nHu zhang is used traditionally for wound healing. In animal research, topical hu zhang extract improved wound healing, possibly by reducing inflammation and improving the rate of collagen production (93966).\nXanthine oxidase inhibition\nPreliminary evidence shows that a hu zhang root extract can inhibit xanthine oxidase, suggesting that hu zhang might have a role in gout. However, the degree of xanthine oxidase inhibition is about 38 times less with hu zhang compared to allopurinol (13127)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Oral huperzine A seems to improve memory, cognitive function, and behavior in patients with this condition.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical studies in patients with Alzheimer disease show that, overall, huperzine A 200-800 mcg in 2-3 divided doses daily for 8-36 weeks improves cognitive function as measured on some scales, but not others, when compared with placebo (55674, 93482). Improvement in cognitive function was observed consistently when measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (55674, 93482, 93483, 101469). However, results are inconsistent with other scales, such as the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS), and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) (55674, 93482). Meta-analyses also show that huperzine A improves overall behavior and performance of daily living activities when compared with placebo (55674, 93482).\n\nMost research has been conducted in China, where huperzine A is an approved drug for this condition. Only one clinical trial has been conducted in the United States. This study was conducted in patients with probable mild to moderate Alzheimer disease and shows that taking huperzine A 200 mcg twice daily for at least 16 weeks does not improve cognition based on the ADAS-Cog when compared with placebo. However, this dose results in modest benefit when cognition is measured using the MMSE, and a higher dose of 400 mcg twice daily shows modest benefit when measured on both the ADAS-Cog and MMSE (93479). Long-term, large-scale clinical trials in diverse geographic locations are necessary to confirm these findings and determine which dose of huperzine A, if any, is beneficial.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral huperzine A is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nOne very small, double-blind randomized crossover study in physically active adults shows that taking huperzine A 200 mcg as a single dose 30-45 minutes prior to exercise does not affect athletic performance, neuromuscular performance, or cognitive function when compared with placebo (107470). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of continued administration of huperzine A on athletic performance are unclear.\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral huperzine A is beneficial in patients with cocaine use disorder.\nA very small clinical study in adults with cocaine use disorder shows that taking huperzine A in gradually increasing doses over 9 days, up to a dose of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily, might attenuate the stimulation and anxiety effects of an intravenous cocaine infusion when compared with placebo (93484). It is unclear if huperzine A can attenuate cravings and cocaine use in these individuals.\nless\nCognitive impairment. Although there is interest in using oral huperzine A for mild cognitive impairment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of huperzine A for this condition.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral huperzine A is beneficial in patients with major depressive disorder.\nA meta-analysis of three small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with major depressive disorder shows that taking huperzine A 100-300 mg daily in combination with antidepressants for 6-8 weeks does not further improve depressive symptoms when compared with antidepressants alone. However, huperzine A might improve cognitive functioning, based on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) (93485). All available research has been conducted in China, so it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nMemory. It is unclear if oral huperzine A is beneficial for improving memory in healthy adolescents.\nA small clinical trial in Chinese adolescents around 15 years of age who complain of poor memory shows that taking huperzine A 100 mcg daily for 4 weeks improves memory quotient scores when compared with placebo (4626).\nless\nMyasthenia gravis. It is unclear if intramuscular huperzine A is beneficial in patients with myasthenia gravis.\nA small, open-label clinical trial in stabilized patients with myasthenia gravis shows that giving huperzine A 400 mcg intramuscularly for 10 days maintains muscle strength similarly to patients treated with intramuscular neostigmine alternating with intramuscular huperzine A. Huperzine A was reported to have a 7-hour duration of effect, compared to only 4 hours with neostigmine (3561).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral huperzine A may modestly improve symptoms of schizophrenia in adults.\nA meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical trials in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia shows that taking huperzine A 150-400 mcg daily for 8-24 weeks as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications improves memory, intelligence, and positive, but not negative, psychiatric symptoms when compared with antipsychotic medications alone (93478). Limited research also suggests that huperzine A might improve outcomes in patients with resistant schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. A small, open-label clinical study in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and cognitive impairment shows that adding huperzine A 300 mcg daily for 12 weeks to treatment with antipsychotics improves negative symptoms of schizophrenia by 32% and memory by 15% when compared to baseline (55665).

It reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for up to three hours and crosses the blood-brain barrier (3137). It raises acetylcholine levels in various areas of the brain to different degrees. The largest increases occur in the frontal and parietal cortexes with 125% and 105% increases respectively, while other brain regions have 22% to 65% increases (3141). Huperzine A might be more specific for AChE and have a longer duration of action than the drugs tacrine (Cognex) or donepezil (Aricept), which are marketed as prescription drugs for Alzheimer disease (3131, 3132). In animal studies, huperzine A was found to be 64 times more potent than tacrine (3561).\nHepatic effects\nIn vitro studies with rat liver show that huperzine A increases hepatocyte loss of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), but not lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The effect on ALT and AST can be completely blocked by atropine, suggesting that it is due to AChE inhibition rather than direct hepatotoxicity (55618).\nN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist effects\nHuperzine A is a weak antagonist at cerebral cortex NMDA receptors (3129, 3137).\nNeurological effects\nHuperzine A may have neuroprotective effects related to antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activity. The anti-apoptotic effects may be due to down-regulation of anti-apoptosis genes (55583, 55601, 55614, 55619). Laboratory research shows that huperzine A can upregulate nerve growth factor and its receptors (55642). Huperzine A can also protect against beta-amyloid peptide induced oxidative stress, and it may shift metabolism of beta-amyloid to a non-amyloidogenic pathway (55583, 55589, 55590, 55603, 93479). Huperzine A also protects neurons against toxic levels of glutamate by blocking glutamate-induced neuronal calcium influx and cell death (3131, 3561).\n\nHuperzine A might protect against seizures and neuropathological changes caused by exposure to organophosphate nerve agents such as soman by maintaining peripheral and central stores of acetylcholine (3137, 3139).\n\nHuperzine A has also been evaluated for cocaine use disorder. A very small clinical study shows that taking huperzine A might attenuate the stimulation and anxiety effects of an intravenous cocaine infusion. Huperzine A does not influence the metabolism of cocaine, so this effect is thought to be due to dopaminergic activity (93484)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nConstituents of hyacinth bean include proteins such as arcelin and dolicholin (26818, 26827), saponins, such as lablab saponin 1 (26819, 26837), lablabosides (26837), phytosterols (26839), and lectins (26812, 26822, 26835, 26836, 26844, 26849). Cooking hyacinth beans increases the digestibility of its proteins and starches, but decreases the content of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and thiamine (26823).\nAntidiabetic effects\nHyacinth bean and related beans are of interest for diabetes. In an animal model of type 2 diabetes, hyacinth bean polysaccharide reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and pancreatic inflammation and oxidative stress. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to an increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 levels in the gut and pancreas, promoting insulin secretion, reducing inflammatory markers including nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6, and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (115752).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn an animal model, hyacinth bean extract protects against high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The extract improves liver function tests and serum lipid levels, increases adiponectin levels, and decreases expression of hepatic genes involved in liver fat uptake and accumulation (98624, 98625)."

            "Overview": "Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide chain of repeating disaccharide units. It is found throughout the body where it serves as part of the supporting structure in the extracellular space. It is found most abundantly in cartilage, synovial fluid, skin, and the aqueous humor in the eye (9139). Some hyaluronic acid products are available as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medical devices for various routes of administration, including intra-articular, deep subcutaneous, and ophthalmic.\n\nThis monograph does not include information on the use of approved medical devices or injectable products.",
            "Warnings": "The FDA has warned consumers and healthcare professionals against the use of unapproved needle-free devices for the injection of lip and facial fillers, including those containing hyaluronic acid. The use of these needle-free devices has resulted in serious injury, and in some cases permanent harm, to the skin, lips, and eyes (108613).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDry eye. Applying eye drops containing hyaluronic acid alone or in combination with other ingredients, seems to improve symptoms of dry eye.\nA large meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with dry eye disease shows that using eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.1% to 0.4% for at least 14 days modestly improves tear production when compared with artificial tears or saline control, with a more significant improvement when compared with saline control. Tear stability is also modestly improved when compared with saline control (108622). Several individual clinical studies using specific hyaluronic acid eye drops have also demonstrated improvement. One clinical study in patients with dry eye disease shows that applying eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.1% to 0.3% 5-6 times daily for 12 weeks might improve symptoms to a similar degree as cyclosporine 0.05% eye drops. The products used in this study included Hyalein ophthalmic solution 0.1%, New Hyaluni ophthalmic solution 0.15%, and Hyaluni ophthalmic solution 0.3% (97885). Another clinical study shows similar efficacy between hyaluronic acid 0.15% eye drops (New Hyaluni), applied 6 times daily for 12 weeks, and eye drops containing cyclosporine 0.05% and carboxymethylcellulose 0.5%, applied twice daily (110555). A smaller clinical study in patients with dry eye disease shows that applying specific eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% (Hyalistil) seems to have similar efficacy as using tamarind seed polysaccharide eye drops (16301). Furthermore, adding hyaluronic acid to conventional treatment seems to offer additional benefit. A large multicenter clinical trial in patients with dry eye disease shows that applying 1-2 drops of artificial tears containing carboxymethylcellulose 0.5% and hyaluronic acid 0.1% (Optive Fusion, Allergan) at least 2 times daily for 3 months seems to further improve pain and discomfort when compared with using artificial tears containing carboxymethylcellulose alone (104384). One small clinical study also shows that hyaluronic acid 0.3% ocular gel and hyaluronic acid 0.18% eye drops, applied 4-6 times daily for 12 weeks, are equally effective for improving dry eye symptoms (110556).\n\nHyaluronic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Several small clinical studies in patients with dry eye syndrome ranging from mild to severe shows that applying eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% or 0.3%, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and glycerin (Visaid 0.2% or 0.3%, Avizor S.A.), administered as one drop 3-8 times daily for one month, improves some signs and symptoms of dry eye when compared with sodium chloride 0.9% (97894, 97895). Conversely, a large clinical study in patients with mild to moderate dry eye disease shows that applying preservative-free eye drops containing sodium hyaluronate with chondroitin sulfate (Humylub Ofteno PF, Laboratorios Sophia), one drop into each eye four times daily for 90 days, seems to be no different for improving dry eye severity when compared with using polyethylene/propylene glycol eye drops (104443).\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Topical application of hyaluronic acid-impregnated gauze reduces wound size and promotes wound healing.\nClinical studies in patients with at least one leg ulcer of venous or mixed arterial/venous origin show that once daily application of a specific hyaluronic acid-impregnated gauze (Ialuset, Laboratoires Genévrier) reduces wound size at 45 days by 73% and produces complete wound healing at or before 20 weeks in 40% of patients. In those receiving a neutral vehicle gauze, these improvements occurred in 46% and 19% of patients, respectively (108627, 108640).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Oral hyaluronic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is also unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial for aging skin.\nA very small study shows that taking a specific combination product (GliSODin Skin Nutrients Advanced Anti-Aging Formula, Isocell North America Inc.) containing hyaluronic acid, krill oil, sea buckthorn berry oil, and cacao bean extract orally three times daily for 90 days, along with applying tazarotene 0.1% cream, moderately decreases wrinkling and photodamage and improves skin moisture and elasticity when compared with tazarotene cream alone (91778). Another small clinical study in females with aging skin shows that taking a specific combination product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing hyaluronic acid 100 mg, chondroitin sulfate 200 mg, and collagen peptides 600 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces lines and wrinkles by about 13% when compared with baseline (28681). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, it should be noted that both studies were funded by the product manufacturer.\n\nA small open-label clinical study in females with mild to moderate lip dryness and mild to severe lip condition shows that three daily applications of a two-step lip treatment containing hyaluronic acid for 4 weeks improves the overall condition of lips, as well as texture/visual roughness, plumpness, color/rosiness, definition/contour, and lines/wrinkles when compared with baseline (108634). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if nasal irrigation with sodium hyaluronate is beneficial in patients with mild, persistent seasonal allergic rhinitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild, persistent seasonal allergic rhinitis receiving an oral antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid shows that nasal irrigation with sodium hyaluronate twice daily for 1 month improves mucociliary clearance time by 3 minutes, compared with 1 minute with the use of isotonic saline and 5 minutes with the use of surfactant (108630). It is unclear if this change is associated with clinically relevant symptom improvement.\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial in patients with burns.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials suggests that topical hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid derivatives might improve the healing of wounds, including burns, when compared with control (104389). A small nonrandomized clinical study in patients with partial- to full-thickness burns shows that hyaluronic acid 0.2% gel daily for 12 weeks during the re-epithelialization phase reduces erythema, tension, pruritus, burning, and neoangiogenesis when compared with baseline (108636). The lack of statistical comparison to the ozonated oil group and the single-blinded nature of the study limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial for canker sores.\nA clinical study in adults with recurrent canker sores shows that applying a gel containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% two to three times daily for 7 days reduces soreness immediately and for up to 30 minutes after application when compared with baseline. However, these improvements are numerically similar to those seen with placebo (108637). The lack of statistical comparison to placebo limits the validity of this finding. A small observational study in children with recurrent canker sores has found that applying a gel containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% twice daily for 7 days is similarly effective to dexamethasone topical ointment applied three times daily for 5 days for reducing pain and ulcer size (104388).\nless\nCorneal abrasion. It is unclear if eye drops containing hyaluronic acid are beneficial in preventing recurrence in patients with a history of traumatic corneal abrasion.\nA small clinical study in patients with fully healed traumatic corneal abrasion at risk for recurrence shows that administration of eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.3% five times daily for 3 months does not reduce the incidence rate of major symptomatic episodes at 12 months when compared with observation alone (108623).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Oral hyaluronic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of results from 4 clinical studies shows that applying hyaluronic acid combination gels or hyaluronic acid-based biomaterials to diabetic foot ulcers increases the odds of complete healing at 12 weeks by about 1.7-fold when compared to control treatment. Forms of hyaluronic acid assessed in the evaluated studies included zinc hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid-based biomaterial (Hyalograft 3D autograft), and a gel containing hyaluronic acid and amino acids (Vulnamin Gel, Errekappa) (91776). It is not clear if the beneficial effects were due to hyaluronic acid or other components of the treatments.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral hyaluronic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in healthy, recreationally active adults shows that a specific product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing hyaluronic acid 150 mg, chondroitin sulfate 300 mg, and collagen peptides 900 mg, taken twice daily for 6 weeks prior to two bouts of resistance exercise, attenuates muscle damage and decreases delayed-onset muscle soreness when compared with placebo (96301). It is unclear if these effects are due to hyaluronic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. Furthermore, it should be noted that both studies were funded by the product manufacturer.\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral hyaluronic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPatients with non-erosive GERD are thought to be less responsive to conventional acid suppression with proton pump inhibiters (PPIs) and H-2 blockers. A small preliminary clinical study shows that taking a syrup containing hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate along with PPIs, H2-receptor antagonists, and/or antacids, reduces the intensity of symptoms associated with non-erosive GERD by about 3.5-fold when compared with placebo (89592). A larger clinical study in patients with non-erosive GERD shows that taking a different formulation of the same combination of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid (Esoxx, Alfa Wassermann) 4 times daily for 14 days, in conjunction with a PPI, improves GERD symptom severity by 21%, heartburn by 15%, and regurgitation by 10% when compared with using a PPI and placebo (101271). Hyaluronic acid has also been evaluated in combination with chondroitin sulfate in patients with extraesophageal symptoms of GERD. A small, open-label study shows that taking a specific combination product (Gerdoff, SOFAR S.p.A.) containing hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate three times daily with omeprazole 40 mg daily for 6 weeks increases the rate of treatment response, defined as a 50% or greater improvement in reflux symptoms index scores, by around 40% when compared with omeprazole alone. While average symptom scores were not significantly improved with the combination product over omeprazole, the need for omeprazole as rescue therapy for breakthrough symptoms was reduced in the treatment group (109648). It is unclear if the findings described above are due to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, or the combination.\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if hyaluronic acid used in a mouthwash reduces gingivitis severity.\nA small clinical study in patients with biofilm-induced gingivitis shows that rinsing with 10 mL of hyaluronic acid 0.025% mouth wash (Gengigel, RICERFARMA SRL) for 1 minute twice daily reduces probing index and bleeding when compared with rinsing with a placebo solution, but is less effective when compared with chlorhexidine 0.12% solution (104383). Another small clinical study in patients with plaque-induced gingivitis shows that rinsing with 10 mL of a mouthwash containing hyaluronic acid 0.1% and hydrogen peroxide 1.8% for 30 seconds twice daily for 21 days reduces gingival index scores but not plaque index scores when compared with placebo (110554). It is unclear if these findings are due to hyaluronic acid, hydrogen peroxide, or the combination.\nless\nIntranasal surgery. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid irrigation improves recovery in patients after nasal surgery.\nA small clinical study in patients that underwent nasal surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis shows that performing nasal irrigation with high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate 9 mg twice daily for 6 weeks improves sinus scarring, crusting, and headache when compared with nasal irrigation with saline. However, the sodium hyaluronate irrigation did not improve sinus inflammation or secretions, nasal obstruction, or facial pain (101288).\nless\nIntrauterine adhesions. Several small studies suggest that intrauterine administration of hyaluronic acid gel seems to prevent intrauterine adhesions after uterine surgery.\nMeta-analyses of 11-12 small clinical studies in patients undergoing uterine surgery shows that intrauterine application of 1-10 mL of hyaluronic acid gel after surgery reduces the risk of intrauterine adhesions by around 50% and increases pregnancy rates when compared with no treatment (110551, 110552). One analysis suggests that hyaluronic acid is most effective for prevention of intrauterine adhesions when at least 5 mL of gel is applied (110551).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial in patients with oral lichen planus.\nA clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus shows that application of a gel containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% four to five times daily for 28 days reduces soreness in as little as 5 minutes for up to 4 hours when compared with baseline. These findings are numerically similar to those seen with placebo; however, the lack of statistical comparison to placebo limits the validity of this finding (108635). A small clinical study in patients with symptomatic oral lichen planus (including mixed forms) shows that application of a gel containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% three times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective to triamcinolone for improving pain, erythema, and lesion size (108633). It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups.\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial in patients with moderate to severe facial melasma.\nA small clinical study in patients with mostly mixed-type, moderate to severe facial melasma shows that twice daily application of hyaluronic acid along with isobutylamido thiazolyl resorcinol reduces melasma severity similarly to isobutylamido thiazolyl resorcinol alone (108628). The single-blinded nature of the study limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nOral mucositis. Topical hyaluronic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children aged 5 years or older with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis shows that using a solution containing sodium hyaluronate, verbascoside, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mucosyte; Biopharm) three times daily is more effective than placebo for improving pain and other symptoms (97890). Another small clinical study in adults in recovery from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows that using a spray product containing sodium hyaluronate with synthetic amino acid precursors of collagen (Mucosamin) attenuates the development of severe oral mucositis when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% (97889).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral hyaluronic acid is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.\nA small study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking chicken comb extract (Hyal-Joint, Bioibérica) 80 mg, standardized to contain hyaluronic acid 60% to 70%, once daily for 8 weeks does not reduce pain when compared with placebo (55742). This study was limited by small size and a significant placebo effect. Another small study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a different supplement (Oralvisc, Bioibérica) 80 mg standardized to contain hyaluronic acid 70% and glycosaminoglycans once daily for 3 months modestly reduces pain when compared with placebo (91779). Reasons for these differing findings may relate to hyaluronic acid formulation, study funding sources, or the magnitude of placebo effect. Hyaluronic acid has also been studied in combination with chondroitin and collagen peptides (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) with some evidence of benefit (28680).\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if using intranasal hyaluronic acid solution is beneficial for otitis media in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 3-12 years of age who have recurrent or chronic middle ear inflammation and adenoiditis shows that using a compound (Yabro, IBSA Farmaceutici Italia S.r.l.) containing hyaluronic acid in saline intranasally 15 days per month for 3 months modestly reduces the number of patients with impaired otoscopy or middle ear function when compared to baseline (97888). It is unclear if this effect is due to the hyaluronic acid product or to the natural resolution of inflammation over time.\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial for the prevention of radiation dermatitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy following lumpectomy shows that three daily applications of a specific hyaluronic acid gel (RadiaPlex, MPM Medical) to one side of the breast results in a grade 2 or greater dermatitis occurrence rate of 62%, compared with a rate of 48% on the side receiving petrolatum-based gel. A review of a planned interim analysis led to early trial discontinuation (108638).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. It is unclear if hyaluronic acid solution is beneficial for acute or chronic rhinosinusitis when used in an intranasal saline rinse.\nA small clinical study in adults with acute rhinosinusitis who are being treated with levofloxacin and prednisone shows that using a 3% hyaluronic acid in saline nasal douche twice daily improves smell, obstruction, and discharge within 14 days when compared with saline alone (97886). A very small clinical study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps shows that receiving micronized nasal hyaluronic acid douches twice daily for 30 days improves nasal symptoms, nasal obstruction, and ability to smell to a similar degree as normal saline (104387).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if vaginal hyaluronic acid is beneficial for improving sexual function in adults with dyspareunia.\nA small nonrandomized clinical study in females with dyspareunia while taking oral hormonal contraceptives shows that once daily vaginal application of a hyaluronic acid gel for 12 weeks reduces pain and improves sexual function at 12 weeks when compared baseline. Though patients treated with twice weekly vaginal estrogen therapy had better 12-week scores than patients treated with hyaluronic acid, it is unclear if the improvements from baseline differed between groups (108639).\nless\nTooth extraction. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial for wound healing after tooth extraction.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing tooth extraction shows that application of hyaluronic acid 0.2% gel or hyaluronic acid 0.1% spray to the extraction socket twice daily for 7 days increases the rate of wound closure when compared with no treatment (110553). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control group.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral and intravesical hyaluronic acid have been evaluated for the prevention of UTI in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective studies shows that intravesical administration of 50 mL of specific solutions containing chondroitin sulfate 2% and hyaluronic acid 1.6% (iAluRil, IBSA Farmaceutici; Cystistat, Bioniche), once weekly to once monthly for up to 6 months, reduces the rate of UTI recurrence by about 2-3 incidents per year and delays the time to the first UTI recurrence when compared with placebo or prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (99688). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the low quality and high heterogeneity of the included studies, as well as concerns for publication bias. Also, the effect of hyaluronic acid alone is unclear.\n\nOral hyaluronic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the prevention of recurrent UTI. A small prospective observational study shows that taking 1-2 capsules of a combination of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, curcumin, and quercetin daily for 15 days each month, in conjunction with the use of local topical estrogen therapy for up to 12 months, reduces the number of women with recurrent UTIs when compared with taking the oral combination product or the vaginal estrogen product alone (96781). It is unclear if this effect is due to hyaluronic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVaginal atrophy. It is unclear if topical hyaluronic acid is beneficial for improving symptoms of vaginal atrophy.\nA small, open-label clinical trial in patients going through menopause with symptoms of vaginal atrophy shows that applying 3 grams of a topical vaginal preparation of hyaluronic acid (Hyalo Gyn, Fidia Farmaceutici) every 3 days for 30 days improves vaginal health scores and reduces vaginal itching, vaginal burning, and pain during intercourse when compared to baseline. However, it does not appear to be any more effective than a polycarbophil vaginal gel (110549). Also, a small observational study in postmenopausal patients with vulvovaginal atrophy has found that applying a topical vaginal preparation containing hyaluronic acid (Justgin, JustPharma) three times weekly for 8 weeks is associated with improved symptoms of vaginal dryness, burning, and itching, as well as pain during intercourse, when compared to baseline (97887). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group and retrospective nature of the study.\n\nSome research has evaluated combination products containing hyaluronic acid for vaginal atrophy. A clinical trial in patients with cervical cancer shows that intravaginal administration of a specific suppository (Santes, Lo.Li. Pharma) containing hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and vitamin A, once daily for the 5 week duration of radiotherapy reduces vaginal dryness, inflammation, and dyspareunia when compared with no additional treatment (101283). Also, a small, open-label clinical study in patients with vaginal atrophy after treatment for breast cancer shows that intravaginal application of a suppository containing hyaluronic acid and extract of aloe, marigold, tiger grass, and tea tree daily for 10 days then every 3 days for 80 days improves vaginal health scores and reduces vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse when compared to baseline, with no difference between the hyaluronic acid-containing suppository and vaginal laser therapy (110550). It is unclear if these findings are due to hyaluronic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWound healing. Small clinical studies show that topical hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid derivatives may improve the healing of various types of wounds.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials suggest that topical hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid derivatives might improve the healing of burns, wounds, and skin ulcers when compared with control (104389).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate hyaluronic acid for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide chain of repeating disaccharide units. It is found throughout the body where it serves as part of the supporting structure in the extracellular space. It is found most abundantly in cartilage, synovial fluid, skin, and the aqueous humor in the eye (9139). The disaccharide moiety consists of sodium acetyl glucosamine and sodium glucuronate (8498). Hyaluronic acid is obtained from rooster combs and from bacterial fermentation. The source and preparation method determine the molecular weight, which varies between 90,000 and 5,000,000 daltons. The primary therapeutic effects of hyaluronic acid are physical lubricating and cushioning. The viscosity of hyaluronic acid increases as the concentration, molecular weight, and polysaccharide chain length increase (9139).\nAnti-bacterial effects\nIn vitro, hyaluronic acid interferes with bacterial adhesion. Early clinical research suggests that hyaluronic acid might prevent ear infections and urinary tract infections, and help to treat sinus infections (97888).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHyaluronic acid may decrease osteoarthritis pain by decreasing inflammation. Oral hyaluronic acid seems to modestly decrease levels of inflammatory cytokines (91779).\nJoint effects\nHyaluronic acid has been used for numerous joint disorders. Some research suggests it might prevent the breakdown of natural cushioning barriers in joint (9134, 9139, 55747). Hyaluronic acid seems to bind to cellular receptors on located on the surface membrane of cartilage and other cell types, possibly modulating immune response and improving wound healing (7883, 9126).\n\nIn osteoarthritis, hyaluronic acid might inhibit the release of enzymes that contribute to the breakdown of cartilage. It seems to inhibit chemotactic factors and phagocytosis by mononuclear leukocytes (7883, 7884).\nWound healing effects\nHyaluronic acid might promote wound healing by improving blood flow, regulating inflammatory processes, and promoting the formation of granulation tissue (9126). In addition, hyaluronic acid improves hydration of the wound margins (8497). Preliminary evidence indicates that hyaluronic acid can decrease adhesions to devices implanted during surgical procedures (7882). It does not improve healing in experimental models of tympanostomy tube (ear tube) placement (8493)."

However, it may not offer additional benefit when used in conjunction with exercise.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research as well as individual clinical studies in healthy older adults, including those at risk for sarcopenia, show that HMB supplementation increases muscle mass or fat-free mass when compared with placebo or other control (96645, 106027, 108771). Furthermore, some clinical research in elderly people with a recent hip fracture who are undergoing rehabilitation shows that a specific liquid nutritional supplement (Ensure Plus Advance, Abbott) providing the calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB) 1.5 grams, calcium 500 mg, and calcidiol 500 IU, taken twice daily in addition to standard therapy, attenuates muscle loss, but does not affect function, when compared with standard therapy alone (96640).\n\nHMB has also been evaluated in combination with exercise. In a meta-analysis subgroup of healthy, older adults, HMB supplementation combined with exercise did not result in additional increases in fat-free mass when compared with supplementation alone (106027).

Oral HMB, when taken in conjunction with participation in an exercise regimen, does not seem to improve physical performance in older adults.\nMost clinical research in elderly patients shows that HMB is not beneficial for improving overall physical performance (99245, 99249, 102869). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in patients 50-80 years of age shows that taking HMB along with physical exercise does not improve muscle strength, physical performance measures, or body composition when compared with physical exercise alone (102869). Conversely, a small clinical study in older adults shows that taking the calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB) along with vitamin D for 12 months improves a composite functional index of physical performance at 6 and 12 months, but not at 3 and 9 months, when compared with control. The addition of moderate resistance exercise training 3 times weekly did not further improve the composite functional index among those receiving supplementation (106026).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral HMB, alone or in combination with other ingredients, is beneficial for improving performance in athletes at various levels.\nA small clinical study in elite male rowers shows that taking HMB 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks increases aerobic capacity and peak anaerobic power when compared with placebo. It also increases the maximum volume of oxygen consumed, compared with a small decrease following intake of placebo. However, anaerobic adaptation does not seem to be improved (99246).\n\nHMB has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adolescent, middle-distance runners aged 14-17 years shows that supplementation with a specific calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB) (HMB 1250 Mega Caps, Olimp Laboratories) 2.5 grams along with L-arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG 1250 Extreme Mega Caps, Olimp Laboratories) 2.5-3.75 grams, taken 3 times daily, attenuates reductions in countermeasure jump height during a 12-day intensive training camp when compared with placebo (106032). Conversely, a very small clinical study in male collegiate rugby players shows that supplementation with HMB along with creatine monophosphate for 6 weeks does not improve maintenance of performance and body composition when compared with creatine monophosphate alone (106031).

Conversely, a small clinical study in patients with cachexia due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that taking this combination for 12 weeks does not improve body weight or lean body mass when compared with placebo (52340).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral HMB is beneficial in patients with liver cirrhosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with liver cirrhosis shows that taking HMB 3 grams daily for 12 weeks improves muscle mass and some measures of muscle function when compared with baseline (108768). The lack of statistical comparison to placebo limits the validity of these findings. Additionally, it should be noted that the groups were unmatched at baseline in terms of cirrhosis etiology and liver frailty index.\nless\nCritical illness (trauma).

Oral HMB has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that drinking a specific beverage (Juven/Abound, Abbott Nutrition) containing HMB 1.2 grams, L-arginine 7 grams, and L-glutamine 7 grams twice daily for 16 weeks does not improve wound healing when compared with placebo (96637).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral HMB is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA small clinical study in resistance trained males shows that taking a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA) 1 gram prior to a high-volume resistance training session, and then 2 grams in divided doses later that day, attenuates an increase in creatine kinase levels when compared with placebo. Also, perceived recovery 48 hours after exercise was approximately 38% higher than placebo (99250). Conversely, a very small clinical study in elite male rowers shows that taking HMB 3 grams within 30 minutes after each training session and 30 minutes before bed on non-training days for 10 weeks does not reduce markers of exercise-induced muscle damage, including aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase, when compared with placebo (102871).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral HMB does not improve exercise-induced muscle soreness in trained and untrained males.\nOne small clinical study in resistance-trained males shows that taking a specific free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA) (Clear Muscle, Muscle Tech) or a specific calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB) (HMB, Millennium Sport Technologies, Inc.) 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve participant ratings of delayed onset muscle soreness when compared with placebo (102872). Another small clinical study in untrained males participating in a resistance training program shows that taking HMB 3 grams daily for 2-4 weeks prior to resistance training does not reduce muscle soreness when compared with placebo (102873).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral HMB has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with AIDS-related wasting shows that taking HMB 3 grams in combination with arginine 14 grams and glutamine 14 grams daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks seems to increase body weight and lean body mass and possibly improve immune function when compared with placebo (1909).\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral HMB reduces the incidence of complications in patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis.\nA small clinical study in patients on maintenance hemodialysis shows that taking HMB 3 grams daily for 6 months does not affect body composition, bone density, muscle strength, or physical function, when compared with placebo (99255). The validity of this study is limited by its small size and low rate of adherence.\nless\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if an oral calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMA) is beneficial in patients with, or at risk of, malnutrition.\nA large clinical trial in older, community-dwelling adults at medium to high risk for malnutrition who are receiving dietary counseling shows that taking an oral nutrition supplement containing Ca-HMB 0.74 grams twice daily results in achievement of the goal outcome in 33% of patients, compared with 9% of those receiving placebo. The goal outcome was a composite of survival without hospital admission or readmission and at least 5% weight gain at 6 months. Ca-HMB supplementation also resulted in significant improvements in various nutritional and functional outcomes (106028). A retrospective study in patients with or at risk of malnutrition receiving dietary and exercise counseling shows that supplementation with an oral nutrition supplement(Ensure Plus Advance, Abbott Nutrition) containing Ca-HMB 1.5 grams twice daily for 3-6 months seems to improve anthropometrics and body composition when compared with baseline (108772). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to those taking a standard oral nutrition supplement.\nless\nMuscle fatigue. It is unclear if oral HMB is beneficial for reducing muscle fatigue in trained males.\nA small clinical study in trained males shows that taking a free acid form of HMB, 3 grams as a single dose, prior to a muscle damage protocol returns work capacity to pre-exercise levels within 24 hours, compared with more than 72 hours with placebo. However, there was no effect on other measures of muscle recovery (99253).\nless\nMuscle strength. The benefits of HMB for improving muscle strength seem to depend on the physical fitness of the individual. Although small clinical studies suggest HMB may be modestly beneficial in untrained adults, most research has shown no benefit in trained adults.\nA meta-analysis of 11 studies in a mixed population of both trained and untrained healthy adults shows that HMB does not increase muscular strength outcomes or improve body composition when compared with placebo (106030). However, research in specific populations suggests that benefits may differ depending on baseline training level.Most research in previously untrained individuals seems to show that HMB offers a modest benefit on muscle strength (11003, 96642, 96643). Some preliminary clinical research shows that HMB might increase strength and body composition and reduce muscle damage when used during resistance training or intense endurance exercises (1929, 2168, 10062, 55821, 102873). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in mostly untrained males shows that taking HMB 3 grams daily can modestly increase lean body mass by 0.3% and strength by 1.4% weekly (21446). Another meta-analysis assessing untrained weightlifters shows that taking HMB results in small increases in upper body strength, but not lower body strength, when compared with control (96642). Another small clinical study in untrained males participating in a 12-week training program not included in the above meta-analyses shows that taking calcium HMB 1 gram three times daily does not increase muscle strength or reduce fat mass, but might increase fat-free mass in the legs, when compared with placebo (102870).\n\nConversely, most research in trained athletes shows that salt formulations of HMB do not increase muscle strength, improve body composition, or reduce muscle damage (2167, 55820, 55825, 55826, 55831, 96638, 96641, 96643, 102872, 102874). A small clinical study in resistance trained males shows that taking HMB 1 gram three times daily for 9 weeks does not increase muscle strength or lean mass overall, but does increase lower body strength by approximately 9%, when compared with placebo (99251). However, this finding has not been supported in other research in previously trained athletes (96642). Research using the free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA) has shown some benefit in previously trained males. A small clinical study in this population shows that taking HMB-FA 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks increases muscle strength approximately three-fold when compared with placebo. There is also an approximate 90% prevention of muscle strength loss during a two-week overtraining phase when compared with placebo, as well as improvements in lean body mass and muscle power (99248).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral HMB is beneficial for reducing abdominal adiposity.\nA small clinical study in elderly males shows that taking HMB 1.5 grams twice daily for 12 weeks while undergoing a resistance training program reduces abdominal adiposity by approximately 9.5% when compared with either the resistance exercise program alone, HMB alone, or placebo (99247). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking a specific product (Abound, Abbott) containing a calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB), L-arginine, and L-glutamine twice daily for 4 weeks reduces visceral adipose tissue by 94 grams, compared with an increase of 60 grams in those taking placebo (108773). It is unclear if this effect is due to HMB, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOral mucositis. Oral HMB has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Abound, Abbott) containing HMB 1.2 grams, arginine 7 grams, and glutamine 7 grams in water twice daily during treatment does not reduce the incidence of moderate to severe functional changes from oral mucositis when compared with baseline (99243). The validity of this finding is also limited by the lack of a comparator group and the use of subjective measures.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Oral HMB has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with abdominal malignancies shows that taking a specific product (Abound, Abbott) containing HMB 1.2 grams, arginine 7 grams, and glutamine 7 grams in water once daily for ten days, starting three days prior to surgery, does not reduce the incidence of wound complications or length of hospitalization when compared with placebo (99413).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. Oral HMB has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Abound, Abbott) containing HMB 1.2 grams, L-arginine 7 grams, and L-glutamine 7 grams in water twice daily, starting on the first day of chemoradiotherapy and continuing for up to 1 week after completing therapy, does not reduce the incidence of grade 3 dermatitis when compared with control (96639).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate HMB for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nHMB and a calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB) have most often been used in doses of 2.4-3 grams daily, in 1-3 divided doses. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nCalcium HMB (Ca-HMB) and a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA) are two forms of HMB that have been studied; however, Ca-HMB is more commonly used in research. It's not yet known if one form is superior (96644). There is conflicting research with respect to which form has greater bioavailability (99252, 106029).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with HMB.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nPlasma HMB levels have been shown to be elevated approximately 30 minutes following consumption of 1 gram of HMB. Following a single-dose administration of 3 grams of HMB to healthy volunteers, peak plasma levels of about 480 nM/L occurred in 1-2 hours (55824). In human research, HMB absorption is slightly lower when consumed with glucose (55824). Free acid forms of HMB (HMB-FA) have previously been thought to be more bioavailable than the more common calcium salt of HMB (Ca-HMB), producing increased peak plasma levels and plasma clearance rates and no effect on urinary loss. However, more recent research has not confirmed these findings (99252, 106029).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of HMB has been estimated at approximately 2.5 hours, with less than 15% to 30% of the unchanged compound excreted in the urine. Plasma HMB peaked at about 1 hour when administered with glucose, and at about 2 hours when administered alone (55824).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nHMB is a byproduct of metabolism of the amino acid leucine and its ketoacid, alpha-ketoisocaproate. It can be found naturally in small quantities in grapefruit, alfalfa, and catfish (2168, 55827). HMB is also a precursor to cholesterol. HMB found in the cytosol of liver and muscle cells is converted to beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutarate-Co-A (HMG-CoA) (2168, 3374).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA very small clinical study in young males performing an oral glucose tolerance test shows that taking a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA) reduces insulin exposure, but not glucose exposure or several insulin sensitivity indices, when compared with not taking HMB-FA. The effects on insulin exposure were not observed in older males (106029).\nImmunomodulation effects\nIn human research, HMB supplementation increased basophils (55822), lymphocytes, and eosinophils (55828). In human research, a combination of HMB, arginine, and glutamine seemed to increase the number of CD3 and CD8 cells (1909). Preliminary in vitro research shows that HMB enhances nitrogen-stimulated DNA synthesis in lymphocytes, but only in the presence of leucine (55838).\nMuscular effects\nHMB inhibits proteolysis and increases protein synthesis (96644). HMB found in the cytosol of liver and muscle cells is converted to beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutarate-Co-A (HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA is used for the cellular synthesis of cholesterol, and might also promote muscle growth by reducing the catabolism of muscle protein (2168, 3374, 99254). There is also some evidence that HMB lowers levels of creatine phosphokinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and decreases the excretion of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH). This suggests that HMB might also prevent or decrease muscle membrane inflammation or injury, and prevent increased proteolysis that is often associated with intense exercise (1929, 2168, 3374, 55821, 99248). HMB prevents muscle protein degradation in cancer-induced weight loss through attenuation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway of protein degradation (55832, 55833, 55834, 55837). Research in murine myotubes as a surrogate model of skeletal muscle has indicated that HMB may increase proteasome expression by the tumor factor proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) (55834). The specific mechanism related to the anticatabolic effects of HMB in skeletal muscle is still not clear. Multiple other signaling pathways, including p38/MAPK-and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms, have been suggested as potentially being involved (99254).\nRenal effects\nIn human research, HMB supplementation seems to decrease urine urea nitrogen and plasma urea, suggesting a nitrogen-sparing effect (10062).\nWound-healing effects\nHMB in combination with arginine and glutamine has been shown to enhance collagen synthesis (52286)."

Other hyperimmune egg products have been prepared by immunizing hens with other organisms, including rotavirus (13206), Porphyromonas gingivalis (102902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (102908, 102909), and Helicobacter pylori (102910, 102911).",

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in recreationally active young men shows that taking hyperimmune egg (Immune26, Legacy for Life) orally in a dose of 4.5 grams daily for 2 days, then 9 grams daily for 2 days, then 13.5 grams daily for 6 days, reduces the maximum heart rate and increases peak power during three 5-minute submaximal exercise bouts on a treadmill when compared with placebo (102905). Poor study design limits the reliability of this research.\nCystic fibrosis. Preliminary clinical research in cystic fibrosis patients aged 2-32 years who have had a prior infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that using a hyperimmune egg yolk extract containing 50 mg of IgY antibodies to two strains of P. aeruginosa as a gargle once daily at bedtime, and then swallowing the liquid, prolongs the time to the second infection when compared with patients who do not receive the gargle (102908). During follow-up of 36-92 months (mean 57 months), patients using the gargle had 2.5 positive sputum cultures for P. aeruginosa per 100 months of observation, compared with 13.7 per 100 months in the untreated control group. In the treated group, no patients became chronically colonized with the organism, compared with 24% of patients in the control group (102908). In further follow-up lasting up to 12 years, the treated patients were switched to an egg extract containing 50 mg of IgY antibodies against six strains of P. Aeruginosa, which was used as a gargle for 2 minutes once daily and swallowed. There were 2.3 positive sputum cultures per 100 months of observation, and 2 patients developed chronic colonization with P. aeruginosa. In the untreated control group, there were 7 positive sputum cultures per 100 months, and 7 patients became chronically colonized (102909). The reliability of this research is reduced by lack of randomization, since treated patients from Sweden were compared with untreated patients from Denmark. Additionally, some, but not all, of the evaluated patients were receiving chronic treatment with azithromycin.\nHelicobacter pylori. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific defatted egg powder product prepared from eggs of hens immunized with Helicobacter pylori urease (Ovlagen, GHEN Corp., Japan), 900 mg three times daily after meals for 4 weeks, is associated with a reduction in urea breath test values, but not complete eradication of H. pylori, in asymptomatic volunteers with H. pylori-positive urea breath tests (102910). Other clinical research shows that taking a yogurt drink containing H. pylori urease-specific IgY 15 mg, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium species, 150 mL three times daily for 4 weeks, is associated with a 40% reduction in urea breath test values when compared with baseline in volunteers positive for H. pylori by urea breath test. Taking the same yogurt drink without IgY is associated with a 15% reduction in urea breath test values when compared with baseline (102911). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a direct comparison to the control group.\nHyperlipidemia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific hyperimmune egg powder formulation (Immune26, Legacy for Life) for 26 weeks does not significantly lower cholesterol when compared with baseline (13213). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nOsteoarthritis. Preliminary clinical research shows that some patients with osteoarthritis might have reduced subjective measures of joint pain or swelling after taking a specific hyperimmune egg powder formulation (Immune26, Legacy for Life) for 2 months when compared with baseline (13207). Poor study design limits the reliability of this research.\nPeriodontitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that using lozenges containing hyperimmune egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) from hens immunized with Porphyromonas gingivalis proteinases (gingipains) reduces gingival bleeding index and oral P. gingivalis counts more than placebo in people with periodontitis. Two lozenges, each containing 12 mg powdered IgY, were dissolved in the mouth 3 times daily after meals for 8 weeks (102902).\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific hyperimmune egg powder formulation (Immune26, Legacy for Life) for 2 months does not significantly improve subjective measures of RA symptoms when compared with baseline (13207). Poor study design limits the reliability of this research.\nRotaviral diarrhea. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a preparation of purified egg yolk immunoglobin (IgY) from hens immunized against strains of rotavirus, 10 grams daily in 4 divided doses for 4 days, can modestly decrease rotaviral diarrhea in children aged 2-24 months. The IgY preparation seems to significantly reduce stool output and oral rehydration solution intake on day 1 of treatment. But it does not seem to significantly reduce stool on subsequent days. Children treated with the IgY also seem to clear rotavirus from the stool more quickly when compared with children receiving placebo (13206).\nMore evidence is needed to rate hyperimmune egg for these uses.",

Thus, different hyperimmune egg products contain different types of IgY. OneA specific commercial form of hyperimmune eggthis extract, Egcel (Immune26, Legacy for Life), is produced by immunizing hens with numerous inactivated enteric pathogens including Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and simulans, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and at least 6 species of Streptococcus (13215). IgY can also be produced by immunizing hens against other organisms and molecules including rotavirus, Helicobacter pylori urease, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Porphyromonas gingivalis proteinases (13206, 102902, 102903, 102908, 102909, 102910, 102911).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn mice, hyperimmune egg immunoglobulin (IgY) from hens immunized with VacA, a toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori which causes epithelial cell damage, reduces H. pylori colonization of the stomach and histological changes in gastric tissues when given orally (102903). In clinical research, hyperimmune egg IgY from hens immunized with H. pylori urease appears to reduce, but not eliminate, H. pylori colonization, as measured by urea breath test (102910, 102911). Urease is produced by H. pylori to enable it to survive in the stomach (102911).\nImmunological effects\nTheoretically, egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) from hens immunized against specific diseases could provide passive immunity to humans (13215). It is most likely to be effective for local conditions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as Helicobacter pylori-induced ulcers and rotaviral diarrhea. IgY is hydrolyzed in the GI tract, and in healthy volunteers less than 0.01% of the amount ingested is detected in the stool. In infants and in the presence of diarrhea, GI transit times may be shorter and more IgY may reach the colon intact (102906).\n\nHyperimmune egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) does not interact with mammalian IgG and does not activate mammalian complement. Therefore, it does not cause inflammatory responses in the GI tract (102903)."

Constituents include flavonoids such as apigenin, diosmin, luteolin, and quercetin; phenolic acids such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, rosmarinic acid, and ferulic acid; the diterpenoid lactone marrubiin; the monoterpenoids linalool and 1,8-cineole; quinone, and tannins (6, 11, 55841, 103243, 113575). The plant also contains pinocamphone, isopinocamphone, and pinene (6, 110426).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nResearch in animals shows that methanol extracts of hyssop decrease rat paw edema induced by carrageenan, and inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. Chlorogenic acid, a constituent of hyssop, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Another constituent, rosmarinic acid, inhibits activation of the complement pathway at the site of inflammation (110425).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, hyssop extracts show antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus and HIV. Potential active constituents include caffeic acid and tannins, as well as a polysaccharide (MAR-10) (55841, 55842).\nCentral nervous system effects\nIn an animal model of seizures, a hydroalcoholic extract of the above-ground parts of hyssop given daily for 14 days increases tonic seizure threshold, reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and mortality, and improves memory, learning, and brain antioxidant capacity, including reducing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. Hyssop extracts increase gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor gene expression. The GABA receptor antagonist flumazenil reduces the antiseizure activity of hyssop extracts (113575).\nCytotoxic effects\nResearch in rats implanted with C6 glioblastoma cells, and in cultures of these cells, shows that hyssop extracts have cytotoxic activity, reducing tumor volume via an increase in apoptosis, and a reduction in angiogenesis, inflammation, cell division, and cell proliferation. Animals treated with hyssop extract, 100 mg/kg for 7 days, have decreased tumor volume, decreased invasion of tumor cells into normal tissue, decreased inflammation, less weight loss, and prolonged survival, when compared with animals with implanted tumors who do not receive hyssop extract (110426).\nExpectorant effects\nThe hyssop constituent marrubiin stimulates bronchial secretions (4, 11).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome laboratory research shows that an ethanolic extract of hyssop leaf possesses gastroprotective activity, similar to that of ranitidine, in rats with indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers. This is thought to be due to the antioxidant activity of some constituents of hyssop (103243)."
