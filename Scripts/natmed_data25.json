            "Overview": "Xylitol is a sugar alcohol with 5 carbon atoms. It is made from the plant-based sugar called xylose (95112, 95114). Since xylitol has a sweet taste and lower glycemic index than glucose, it is used as an artificial sweetener (95112, 95125). In the US, products containing xylitol are permitted to be labelled with a health claim regarding the risk for dental caries. This health claim may state that \"xylitol used to sweeten foods may reduce the risk of dental caries\" or that \"xylitol does not promote tooth decay\" (102364).",

Xylitol has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 20 grams daily for up to three years (6815, 6819, 113319).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There insufficient reliable information available about the use of xylitol in medicinal amounts during pregnancy and lactation; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, xylitol is generally well tolerated in food amounts, although it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort at high doses. Topically, xylitol seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: With high doses (30-40 grams), bowel sounds, diarrhea, flatulence.\n\nTopically: Stinging of mucous membranes.\nCardiovascular\nPopulation research in adults at high risk for cardiovascular events suggests that the highest fasting blood levels of xylitol are associated with a 57% increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and a decreased incidence of event-free survival compared with lower levels (113318). As fasting blood levels are unrelated to consumption, it is unclear whether xylitol supplementation increases the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event in this or any population. In healthy adults, a single dose of xylitol 30 grams increases blood levels of xylitol to levels capable of stimulating platelet aggregation in vitro (113318).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, high doses of xylitol can increase the risk of hyperuricemia. In a small study in healthy adults, taking a single dose of xylitol 35 grams in water increases levels of uric acid, while lower doses of xylitol did not have this effect (105980). Intravenous infusion of high doses of xylitol has been associated with hyperuricemia and acidosis, including lactic acidosis (6815).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, acute administration of large amounts of xylitol (24 to 40 grams) can cause osmotic diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence (9, 112857, 113320). However, if the dose is increased gradually, tolerance to this effect can occur and prevent development of diarrhea and flatulence (9). Intranasally, flatulence and abdominal discomfort have been reported rarely (113323).\nless\nHepatic\nIntravenous infusion of high doses has been associated with changes in liver function enzymes (6815).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere are various cases of suspected allergic reactions to xylitol.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDental caries. Using xylitol-containing products topically in the mouth seems to reduce the incidence of cavities.\nUse of xylitol-containing products such as foods, chewing gum, candies, soluble dragees, and toothpaste that provide 1-20 grams of xylitol per day can marginally reduce the incidence of cavity formation in both adults and children (6815, 6819, 6822, 95110, 95114, 95116, 95117, 95125, 113324). Xylitol products appear to be more effective than products containing sorbitol for preventing cavity formation (6822, 95690, 113324).\n\nA scientific council of the American Dental Association states that chewing gum containing xylitol for 10-20 minutes after meals, or using lozenges providing xylitol 5-8 grams in divided doses daily, can reduce the incidence of coronal caries in adults and children 5 years or older (95690). However, these recommendations are based on only weak evidence. There is not enough evidence to recommend xylitol products for preventing caries in children under the age of 5 years (95124, 95690, 112858). In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a health claim for products containing xylitol. These products can state that although frequently eating foods high in sugars and starches as between-meal snacks can promote tooth decay, xylitol used to sweeten food does not promote tooth decay and may reduce the risk of dental caries (102364).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOtitis media. Using xylitol-containing products topically in the mouth on a daily basis seems to reduce the risk of otitis media in preschool-aged children.\nGiving a total daily dose of xylitol 8.4-10 grams as a chewing gum, lozenge, or syrup up to 5 times a day after meals to preschool children seems to reduce the risk of acute otitis media by about 25% when compared with a control containing sucrose alone or with low dose xylitol (6816, 6817, 95112). Xylitol gum and xylitol lozenges appear to be similarly effective for this indication; xylitol syrup might be slightly less effective than xylitol gum (95111, 95112). Some research suggests that xylitol may also reduce the usage of antibiotics for acute otitis media, although results are conflicting (6816, 6817, 95112). However, a more recent clinical trial disagrees with these findings and shows that taking a syrup containing xylitol up to 5 times daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of acute otitis media when compared with a control syrup containing sorbitol (113319). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. However, the number of otitis media episodes was extremely low overall, with no episodes in the many children recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the average xylitol intake in this study was 3.7 grams daily, much lower than in the previous studies.\n\nHowever, xylitol 8.4-10 grams daily, administered at the onset of symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, does not seem to prevent acute otitis media (3846, 95112). It is unclear whether xylitol reduces the risk of acute otitis media in children with recurrent acute otitis media. Limited clinical research shows that xylitol as gum or lozenges does not appear to reduce the risk of acute otitis media among otitis-prone healthy children (95112). However, preliminary clinical research in children aged 1-4 years shows that using a xylitol nasal spray 2-3 times daily for 3 months modestly reduces the number of episodes, as well as the number of episodes treated with systemic or topical antibiotics, when compared to the 3-month period before treatment (113323).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if intranasal xylitol is beneficial in patients with COVID-19.\nPreliminary clinical research in adult outpatients with a positive COVID-19 test who are receiving standard treatment for symptoms lasting less than 3 days shows that using a nasal spray containing xylitol 11%, sodium chloride 0.85%, and grapefruit seed extract 0.2% in water, 2 sprays in each nostril every 3 hours while awake for 72 hours, then every 6 hours for a total of 14 days, does not affect time to symptom resolution or incidence of hospitalization when compared with a normal saline spray (109996).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if inhaled xylitol is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients hospitalized for an exacerbation of cystic fibrosis shows that administering 5 mL of xylitol 15% solution through a nebulizer twice daily for 2 weeks does not improve lung function, the density of sputum microbes, or quality of life when compared with hypertonic saline (103888).\nless\nDental plaque. There is some evidence that chewing xylitol gum reduces oral plaque in adults. It is unclear if topical xylitol solution helps to reduce dental plaque in children or adolescents.\nA meta-analysis of 8 studies in adults shows that chewing sugar-free gum containing xylitol, sorbitol, or maltitol reduces oral plaque levels when compared with chewing sugar-containing gum or not chewing any gum (109997). One small clinical study in children aged 2-5 years shows that applying 40% xylitol solution using gauze once daily for 6 months does not suppress Streptococcus mutans count or reduce plaque accumulation when compared to baseline (95119). Conversely, a small clinical study in adolescents aged 14-17 years shows that rinsing with a solution containing xylitol, lysozyme, sea salt, and menthol (H2Ocean Sea Salt Mouthwash) twice daily for 3 months seems to reduce dental plaque and S. mutans levels when compared to baseline (105979). The validity of this finding is limited due to a lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. Additionally, it is unclear if any effects are due to xylitol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDry mouth. Oral xylitol has only been evaluated in combination with maltitol; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small open-label clinical study in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are experiencing dry mouth while taking omeprazole 40 mg daily shows that taking specific tablets (Xeros Dentaid, Dentaid) containing xylitol 422 mg and malic acid 28.6 mg 3 times daily after meals for 6 months seems to reduce the incidence of dry mouth and increase the buffering capacity of saliva when compared with no additional treatment (105982).\nless\nGingivitis. Topical xylitol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study of patients with gingivitis shows that brushing with a toothpaste containing a combination of xylitol, extra virgin olive oil, and betaine anhydrous daily for 4 months decreases gingival bleeding and improves markers associated with gingival health when compared with placebo and commercial toothpaste (111372).\nless\nGulf war syndrome. It is unclear if intranasal xylitol is beneficial for improving respiratory symptoms in adults with Gulf war syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and Gulf war syndrome shows that administering xylitol 5% solution intranasally via neti pot twice daily for 26 weeks in addition to standard care modestly improves nasal symptoms when compared with standard treatment alone. However, the improvement did not reach the pre-specified measure of clinical significance (105981).\nless\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is unclear if topical xylitol dental wipes help to prevent infections after HSCT.\nOne small open-label clinical trial in children and young adults undergoing HSCT shows that adding xylitol dental wipes 0.7 grams daily to standard care for oral hygiene, starting with ablative chemotherapy and continuing 28 days post-transplant, reduces the risk for bloodstream infections when compared with standard care alone. For every 4 patients treated with xylitol, one bloodstream infection was prevented (103890).\nless\nIntranasal surgery. It is unclear if nasal irrigation with xylitol solution improves pain and obstruction after intranasal surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing endonasal endoscopic surgery shows that nasal irrigation with 60 mL of solution containing xylitol 1 gram in each nostril three times daily for 30 days, starting the second day after surgery, reduces pain and nasal obstruction when compared with saline nasal irrigation (103889).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral xylitol is beneficial for obesity.\nA small clinical trial in adults with obesity shows that taking xylitol daily for 5 weeks does not reduce abdominal fat or lipid levels or have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance or liver health when compared with no treatment. The xylitol dose in this study was 8 grams daily for 2 days, followed by 8 grams twice daily for 3 days, and then 8 grams 3 times daily for the remaining period (113320).\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if topical xylitol is beneficial for reducing dental injection pain in children.\nA small clinical trial in children aged 5-7 years shows that applying xylitol 30% solution to the tongue for 2 minutes prior to topical anesthetic and dental injection modestly reduces pain associated with the injection compared with distilled water. Also, the xylitol solution was as effective as a 30% sucrose solution (113321).\nless\nPostoperative ileus. It is unclear if chewing xylitol gum can reduce the development of postoperative ileus after various types of surgery.\nAn unblinded clinical study in adults undergoing colorectal resection for colon cancer shows that chewing xylitol gum for 15 minutes three times daily, starting on the first postoperative day, reduces the time to first flatus from 53 hours to 39 hours and the time to first defecation from 78 hours to 55 hours when compared with standard care alone (109998). A small clinical study in patients undergoing a Cesarean section shows that chewing xylitol gum for 15 minutes every 2 hours for 8-12 hours, starting 2 hours after surgery, does not reduce the time to first bowel sounds or first feeling of hunger when compared with chewing non-xylitol gum or not chewing any gum. The time to first defecation is 38, 44, and 45 hours, respectively, while times to hospital discharge are 46, 50, and 52 hours, respectively; it is unclear if these differences are statistically significant (109999).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Small clinical studies suggest that intranasal rinses with xylitol solution may modestly improve nasal symptoms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis shows that nasal irrigation using 240 mL of solution containing xylitol 12 grams daily for up to 30 days reduces symptoms better than nasal irrigation with saline (95115, 95122). Another small clinical study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and Gulf war syndrome shows that administering xylitol 5% solution intranasally via neti pot twice daily for 26 weeks in addition to standard care modestly improves nasal symptoms when compared with standard treatment alone. However, the improvement did not reach the pre-specified measure of clinical significance (105981).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

Levels return to near normal within 6 hours (113318). Other clinical research shows that xylitol is poorly absorbed after oral use (112856). However, blood levels were not provided in this study and xylitol levels at baseline were undetectable.\nExcretion\nXylitol has a plasma half-life of approximately 13 minutes and is excreted in urine (113318).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nXylitol is a polyhydric alcohol (polyol) related to the pentose sugar, xylose (9). Xylitol is found in almost all plant material, including fruits such as raspberries, strawberries, and plums; vegetables; and mushrooms. Commercial preparations are extracted from birch wood (268). In the body, xylitol is produced during metabolism of glucose in the liver (268).\nAnti-caries effects\nXylitol has several properties that might provide a locally protective effect against dental caries. Xylitol is not a food source for plaque microorganisms, leading to inhibition of their growth and preventing them from forming the acids which lower salivary pH and contribute to dental caries (107656). Xylitol lowers plaque and salivary levels of caries-causing Streptococcus mutans bacteria by disturbing energy production, resulting in intracellular accumulation of xylitol-5-phosphate (95113, 100174, 107656, 113322). Xylitol also reduces bacterial adhesiveness by reducing production of extracellular polysaccharides (107656). Xylitol increases salivary flow rates and calcium and phosphate concentrations in saliva, which promote buffering and remineralization of tooth surfaces. Xylitol also stimulates activity of the antimicrobial enzyme lactoperoxidase in saliva (6815, 6819).\n\nMost children acquire S. mutans from the mother after birth. Habitual chewing of xylitol gum by mothers with high bacterial levels beginning 3 months after delivery appears to significantly reduce transmission of S. mutans to their children (6818). However, the chewing of xylitol gum by mothers beginning 6 months after birth and continuing until 18 months does not appear to be beneficial (95120).\nAntibacterial effects\nDue to its five-carbon structure, xylitol is not a substrate for growth of most bacteria, and it may inhibit some bacterial enzymes and interfere with their metabolism of six carbon sugars (6819). In the prevention of acute otitis media, xylitol may work by inhibiting growth of bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, and preventing adhesion of pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae to nasopharyngeal cells (3846, 6819).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research shows that xylitol may have antiviral activity against the SARS-COV-2 virus (109996).\nBone effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence from animal models that suggests xylitol might increase the calcium and phosphorus content of bone and protect against osteoporosis (6819).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence from laboratory models that suggest xylitol might have beneficial effects on vascular function. However, in human research, xylitol does not benefit arterial stiffness (113320). Some research in humans suggests that xylitol might increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Population research in adults at high risk for cardiovascular events suggests that the highest fasting blood levels of xylitol are associated with a 57% increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and a decreased incidence of event-free survival compared with lower levels (113318). Also, in healthy adults, a single dose of xylitol 30 grams increases blood levels of xylitol to levels capable of stimulating platelet aggregation in vitro (113318). In vitro, xylitol used at physiological concentrations enhances stimulus-dependent platelet activation or aggregation. In animal models, physiological concentrations of xylitol increase thrombus formation (113318).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in the use of xylitol as a low-glycemic food sweetener in patients with diabetes. However, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of xylitol 7-35 grams dissolved in 300 mL water slightly increases levels of blood glucose, insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK), active glucagon-like peptide-1(aGLP-1), and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) in a dose-dependent manner. Although xylitol did not reduce subjective measures of satiety, it did modestly slow gastric emptying (105980)."
