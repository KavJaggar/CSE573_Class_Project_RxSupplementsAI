            "Overview": "K2/spice is the general name given to a class of compounds known as synthetic cannabinoids. Over 100 different types of synthetic cannabinoids have been identified. When inhaled, K2/spice produces a cannabis-like euphoria. However, K2/spice is also associated with many fatalities and severe adverse events (98847, 99628, 103080, 104898).",
            "Warnings": "Due to safety concerns and the high potential for abuse, many states have banned synthetic cannabinoids. Between 2011 and 2012, fifteen synthetic cannabinoids were classified as Schedule I controlled substances by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (99628). Despite these efforts, manufacturers of synthetic cannabinoids have continued to develop new, structurally-unique chemicals with cannabimimetic effects to replace the banned varieties (98847, 99618, 99624, 99628). There is also risk for unintentional exposure to synthetic cannabinoids. For example, some commercially available cannabidiol products have been found to be contaminated with synthetic cannabinoids (99601, 103040).\n\nAlthough a small number of synthetic cannabinoids are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as prescription medications (e.g., dronabinol, nabilone), these chemicals are not typically found in K2/spice products and are not within the scope of this topic.",
            "Safety": "UNSAFE when inhaled. K2/spice can cause serious psychiatric, neurologic, renal, and cardiovascular adverse effects, including coma and death (99624, 103080, 104898, 104900, 104902, 111236).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: K2/spice is UNSAFE when used during pregnancy and lactation. While the adverse effects of K2/spice have not been adequately described in pregnant or nursing women, reports of serious and sometimes fatal adverse effects in K2/spice users suggests that K2/spice would also be harmful to pregnant or nursing women (99624). Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is involved in numerous stages of pregnancy, including embryo development, transport, and implantation. Because K2/spice can interfere with cannabinoid signaling, it could theoretically compromise fertility and pregnancy outcomes (99623).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice is unsafe and can cause many serious adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nInhaled: Agitation, anxiety, ataxia, diarrhea, dry mouth, hallucinations, hypertension or hypotension, lethargy, nausea, paranoia, tachycardia, vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nInhaled: Acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aggression, agitation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, catatonia, cerebral ischemia, coma, delirium, death, hallucinations, hematologic abnormalities, hyperglycemia, liver failure, myocardial infarction, panic attacks, psychosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, suicidality.\nCardiovascular\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause serious adverse cardiovascular effects, including tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension, coronary vasospasm, acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, ventricular fibrillation, QT prolongation, myocardial ischemia/infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, and sudden cardiac death (98843, 98844, 98846, 98849, 99617, 99619, 99625, 99630, 103080, 104897)(104901, 104905, 107878, 111237, 111239). Data from poison control centers and medical toxicology databases suggest that tachycardia occurs in up to 75% of K2/spice toxicity cases (99617, 99619, 99624). While less common, myocardial ischemia/infarction, stroke, resistant ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and sudden cardiac death have also been reported after K2/spice use (98844, 98846, 98849, 99624, 99625, 99630, 111236, 111239).\n\nThe most common arrhythmias associated with K2/spice are supraventricular, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias can also occur, including left bundle branch block, QT prolongation, AV block, and ventricular fibrillation (107878). In one case series, 10 of 30 patients requiring critical care for K2/spice use experienced QT prolongation (103080). In another case series, adults that used K2/spice had a higher corrected QT interval (434.5 ms) when compared with non-users (411 ms) (104905).\nless\nEndocrine\nK2/spice has been associated with rare reports of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis (108487).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (99616, 99617, 99624, 108487, 111236). In a review of United States poison control center reports, vomiting occurred in around 16% of K2/spice toxicity cases (99617). An analysis of online forum posts from K2/spice users suggests that around 5% of users experience nausea and/or vomiting (99616). In a review of patients experiencing acute kidney injury associated with K2/spice use, the rates of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were 56%, 58%, and 60%, respectively (111236). Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a condition characterized by severe and repetitive episodes of nausea and vomiting, has also been reported with K2/spice use (99624, 111236).\nless\nHematologic\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice has been linked to hematologic complications (98850, 99620, 99626, 111236). An outbreak of synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy was reported in Illinois in 2018. Anticoagulant testing in 15 patients with suspected synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy suggested that K2/spice contaminated with brodifacoum, a 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative was to blame. One death due to synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy was reported during this outbreak (98850). In one case, a 65-year-old male presented with hematochezia, hematuria, and hemoptysis after using K2/spice contaminated with brodifacoum and another 4-hydroxycoumarin, difenacoum. The patient required high-dose vitamin K treatment for 6 weeks and tapering doses over 6 months (104901).\n\nWhen inhaled long-term, K2/spice has been associated with immune thrombocytopenia. In one case, a 23-year-old male with a one-year history of K2/spice abuse presented with epistaxis and petechial rashes on both legs. Laboratory testing confirmed a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, and the patient was successfully treated with prednisolone (99620).\nless\nHepatic\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice has been associated with hepatitis. In one case, a 45-year-old male presenting with somnolence, lethargy, and fatigue after smoking 2 grams of K2/spice daily for one week was found to have evidence of hepatocellular necrosis and worsening liver failure. The patient was treated with N-acetylcysteine and made a full recovery (99622). In another case, a 26-year-old healthy female who used K2/spice presented to the emergency room with worsening liver failure likely due to acute hepatocellular necrosis and ultimately required a liver transplant (104896).\nless\nImmunologic\nWhen inhaled long-term, K2/spice has been associated with immune thrombocytopenia. In one case, a 23-year-old male with a one-year history of K2/spice abuse presented with epistaxis and petechial rashes on both legs. Laboratory testing confirmed a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, and the patient was successfully treated with prednisolone (99620).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice has been associated with rhabdomyolysis (98848, 103080). In one case series, 8 of 30 patients requiring critical care for K2/spice use experienced rhabdomyolysis (103080). Also, a 23-year-old male who smoked K2/spice daily for two weeks presented to the emergency department with psychosis, severe agitation, and highly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. After psychiatric care and intravenous fluids, the patient's CPK levels and other symptoms returned to normal within 15 days. While researchers were unable to rule out other mechanisms of K2/spice-induced rhabdomyolysis, they suggested that this case was secondary to psychomotor agitation from K2/spice-induced psychosis (98848).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause drowsiness, lethargy, vertigo, ataxia, hyperreflexia, nystagmus, confusion, anxiety, cognitive impairment, emotional dysregulation, seizures, and coma (99616, 99617, 99619, 99621, 99624, 103080, 104899, 107877, 108487, 111236). Numerous cases of seizures secondary to K2/spice use have been reported. Between 4% to 15% of poison control center consults or emergency department visits for K2/spice toxicity involved generalized tonic-clonic seizures, including some cases of status epilepticus (99624). A cannabidiol supplement contaminated with the synthetic cannabinoid AB-FUBINACA caused seizures, delirium, agitation, and tachycardia in an 8-year-old male with epilepsy (103040).\n\nComa has been reported, mostly in males using K2/spice alone or concomitantly with alcohol, methadone, or unidentified opiates (103080). Chronic use has been associated with cases of encephalopathy, specifically posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and toxic leukoencephalopathy with hyperreflexia, paratonia (inability to relax muscles), and cogwheel rigidity (98842, 104903). In healthy, cannabis-experienced users, inhaling 75-125 mcg/kg of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 impaired motor coordination, attention, and memory, slowed response speeds, and lowered speed-accuracy efficiency (108486).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause mydriasis (98847, 99624).\nless\nPsychiatric\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause agitation, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety, confusion, altered mental status, panic attacks, aggressive behaviors, and suicidality (98847, 98848, 99616, 99617, 99618, 99619, 99621, 99624, 99626, 103080, 108487, 111236). Agitation, which escalates to delirium and psychosis, appears to be the most common acute psychiatric adverse effect reported after K2/spice use, occurring in up to 41% of toxicity cases (99617, 99619). Anxiety, depression, and hallucinations also appear to be relatively common (99616, 104899). These adverse psychiatric effects might contribute to cases of self-harm and suicide after K2/spice use (99624). Data from over 29,000 adolescents in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System shows that mental health issues associated with the use of K2/spice include paranoia, psychosis, hallucinations, irritability, dissociation, anxiety, catatonia, violence, and self-harm. In a subgroup who had used K2/spice once or twice, 18% attempted suicide, while in the subgroup that had used K2/spice three or more times, 30% attempted suicide. The association between suicide attempts and K2/spice use was strongest in Black and LGBTQ populations (107879).\n\nRegular use of K2/spice over 6-18 months has been associated with withdrawal symptoms including craving, anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations lasting about 5-9 days. Long-term use of K2/spice for 5-24 months has resulted in psychoses, primarily with hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia lasting for 10-14 days, and sometimes as long as 6 weeks. Psychosis gradually subsides to symptoms of anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, which last 4-8 weeks (104904).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice has been associated with dyspnea, dysregulated breathing, pulmonary infiltrates, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (98845, 98847, 99629, 103080, 108487, 111236, 111238). Long-term use of K2/spice has been associated with chronic cough (98847).\n\nIn one case series, 21 of 30 patients requiring critical care for K2/spice use also required mechanical ventilation (103080). In an observational study of 29 patients admitted to emergency departments with confirmed K2/spice overdose, 25% developed acute respiratory failure, although some patients had also been exposed to opioids or sedatives (107880). Additionally, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum have been reported 6 days after ingesting K2/spice in one case (111238).\nless\nRenal\nWhen inhaled, K2/spice can cause acute kidney injury. More than 50 cases requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients who smoked K2/spice (98847, 99624, 111236).\nless",

Most K2/spice products contain a mixture of synthetic cannabinoids, of which over 100 different types have been identified (98847, 99628). To produce K2/spice, the leaves of various plants are sprayed with a blend of synthetic cannabinoids, and the resulting plant material is then vaporized and inhaled. Plants thought to have psychotropic effects are sometimes used for this purpose. These include Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow), Leonotis leonurus (Lion's Ear), Pedicularis densiflora (Indian Warrior), and Rosa canina (Rose Hip). Synthetic cannabinoids are also sold in vaping liquids (108487). There is wide variability among K2/spice products since the production process is not standardized and there are numerous synthetic cannabinoids that can be used (99628).\n\nSome K2/spice products have been contaminated with toxins such as the rodenticides and the 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, brodifacoum and difenacoum, which cause prolonged coagulopathies (98850, 104901).",

A 41-year-old male died due to myocardial ischemia induced by the synthetic cannabinoid ADB-FUBINACA (107878). A 3-year-old child who ingested dried leaves coated with the synthetic cannabinoid 5-fluoro-MDMB-PICA, presented to the hospital with a declining level of consciousness, nystagmus, generalized hypotonia, irregular breathing, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzyme levels (108487).\nTreatment\nMost patients with a suspected K2/spice overdose are given symptomatic care, which may include mechanical ventilation, until symptoms subside (99624, 108487).",

However, the subjective \"high\" does not peak until about 30 minutes, suggesting that distribution into the central nervous system is delayed until this time point (108486).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nK2/spice refers to numerous synthetic cannabinoids which are functionally similar to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Some have been classified as schedule I controlled substances, but new Cardiotoxicity from K2/spice has been attributed to vasospasm, decreased myocardial contractility, myocardial ischemia, increased cardiac workload, and increased cardiac oxygen demand (107878). Patients admitted to an emergency department after K2/spice use have presented with lower blood pressure and several electrocardiogram (ECG) changes when compared with a control group not exposed to K2/spice. The ECG changes included increased P-wave amplitude and width, increased QRS width, decreased T-wave amplitude, and ST elevation (107876, 111237). One case study suggests that K2/spice causes coronary vasospasm with elevated troponins and ECG changes, including ST elevation (111237). Cardiovascular effects can vary between different synthetic cannabinoids. After smoking 1 mg of JWH-122 with tobacco, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased, along with heart rate. These effects were not seen after smoking 2-3 mg of JWH-210 with tobacco (107877).\n\nWhile the pharmacologic effects of some of these compounds have been studied, the unique binding affinities and pharmacological properties of individual synthetic cannabinoids are not known. Additionally, because most K2/spice products include a mixture of various synthetic cannabinoids, the pharmacologic effects of commercially available K2/spice products are not well described.\nCannabinoid effects\nThe synthetic cannabinoids constituting K2/spice elicit cannabimimetic effects by binding to and activating CB1 and CB2 receptors, leading to complex signaling cascades involving G-coupled protein receptors and voltage-gated ion channels. CB1 receptors are found predominantly in the central nervous system, but also in the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, muscles, and vasculature. CB2 receptors are found mainly in the lymphatic system, where they attenuate inflammatory signals, but they also occur in the kidneys. Both CB1 and CB2 receptors are found on platelets (107878). The synthetic cannabinoids bind to both CB1 and CB2 receptors with greater affinity than THC. For example, the binding affinities of JWH-122 and JWH-210 at CB1 receptors are 60- and 90-times higher, respectively, than THC (107877). This likely explains the increased risk for adverse effects with K2/spice over natural cannabinoids. The risk is also enhanced by the lack of cannabidiol and cannabinol in K2/spice, which are thought to mitigate cannabis-associated adverse effects (98847, 99618, 99628, 107877).\nCardiovascular effects\nCardiotoxicity from K2/spice has been attributed to vasospasm, decreased myocardial contractility, myocardial ischemia, increased cardiac workload, and increased cardiac oxygen demand (107878). Patients admitted to an emergency department after K2/spice use have presented with lower blood pressure and several electrocardiogram (ECG) changes when compared with a control group not exposed to K2/spice. The ECG changes included increased P-wave amplitude and width, increased QRS width, decreased T-wave amplitude, and ST elevation (107876, 111237). One case study suggests that K2/spice causes coronary vasospasm with elevated troponins and ECG changes, including ST elevation (111237). Cardiovascular effects can vary between different synthetic cannabinoids. After smoking 1 mg of JWH-122 with tobacco, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased, along with heart rate. These effects were not seen after smoking 2-3 mg of JWH-210 with tobacco (107877).\nPsychotropic effects\nThe psychotropic effects of K2/spice are likely mediated through activation of CB1 receptors. Animal studies show that this activation interferes with oscillations in the neuronal network and impairs sensory gating function in various areas of the brain. These specific changes in brain activity have been associated with schizophrenia and psychosis (98847)."

It is unclear if consuming kale in the diet can reduce the risk of bladder cancer.\nPopulation research suggests that patients with bladder cancer consumed approximately 0.18 fewer cups of cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprout, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, or collards, on a weekly basis in the year prior to diagnosis when compared with people without bladder cancer. The effects of kale, specifically, are unclear (14864). Other population research suggests that eating at least five servings per week of cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower, Brussels sprout, cabbage, broccoli, and kale, is associated with a 51% reduction in the risk of developing bladder cancer in males when compared with eating up to one serving per week. However, higher intake of kale alone does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer (26184).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if consuming kale in the diet can reduce the risk of breast cancer.\nPopulation research suggests that the highest dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, and kale, is associated with a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal adults when compared with the lowest intake (26188). Cruciferous vegetables might increase urinary levels of 2-hydroxyestrone, and its ratio to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which could reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, research in pre-menopausal adults shows that taking a dried kale and Brussels sprout supplement, 3.3 grams daily for 8 weeks, or increasing dietary intake of Brussels sprout or broccoli by one 40-gram serving daily, does not increase urinary levels of 2-hydroxyestrone, or its ratio to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, when compared with placebo (112086).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of kale are the above ground parts. Kale contains carotenoids (including lutein and beta-carotene), vitamin K (phylloquinone), vitamin C, vitamin A, folate, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It also contains glucosinolates including ascorbigen, terpenoids, indole derivatives, and flavonoid glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin (6790, 26497, 90480, 90483, 90484, 109905).\nAnti-cancer effects\nEpidemiological research suggests that cruciferous vegetables such as kale have protective effects against some types of cancer (14145). These vegetables contain about 10 different kinds of glucosinolates (6790). Glucosinolates are usually accompanied by myrosinase, a thioglucosidase enzyme found in plant cells in separate compartments (6792). When the plant cells are damaged by cutting or chewing, the myrosinase is exposed to glucosinolates, catalyzing its hydrolysis to a range of breakdown products, such as indoles, nitriles, and isothiocyanates (ITCs).\n\nITCs are sulfur-containing phytochemicals present in the form of sulforaphane (SFN), phenylethylisothiocyanate, benzylisothiocyanate, and 3-phenylpropylisothiocyanate. These chemicals are thought to be anticarcinogenic due to their effects on phase I and phase II enzymes (10264, 26449, 26483, 47627, 55547). Phase I and phase II enzymes act as the body's first line of defense against cancer by protecting the body from carcinogens that routinely enter the body through the diet and the environment. ITCs generally enhance the activity of phase II enzymes and inhibit phase I enzymes, thus reducing the production of electrophilic intermediates with carcinogenic activity and enhancing the detoxification and clearance of carcinogens. ITCs also act as suppressing agents during the promotion phase of the neoplastic process and induce apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cell growth (26449, 26485).\n\nOther products of glucosinolate hydrolysis, indoles, include indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) (47627). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C inhibits carcinogenesis by inducing enzymes such as cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases (GST), or epoxide hydrolases (EH). These enzymes metabolize carcinogens to more polar and excretable forms (26489, 26491, 47596). Evidence from animal research has shown that indoles and isothiocyanates attenuate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines and are protective towards heterocyclic amines (51183). The effects on PAH and nitrosamines appear to be via induction of GST and inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, respectively.\n\nIndoles and phytoestrogens found in Brassica species may also contribute to the protection of hormone-dependent breast and cervical cancers. Evidence from animal research suggests that I3C inhibits mammary cancers (26469) and that its use may inhibit breast and cervical cancers in women (47627). In women, I3C increases the 2-hydroxylation of estrogen urinary metabolites (47615). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C suppresses the proliferation of various tumor cells, including breast, prostate, endometrial, colon, and leukemic cells (47627).\nMetabolic effects\nResearch in obese animals shows that adding 9% kale to a high -fat diet (45% fat) for 12 weeks lowers serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with the high- fat diet alone. Kale contains compounds which act as bile acid sequestrants, preventing bile acid recirculation and reducing fat absorption. Adding kale to a high -fat diet also prevents increases in endotoxemia and inflammation, but does not reduce body weight, fat accumulation, or insulin resistance when compared with the high- fat diet alone. In adipose tissue, kale increases the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, downregulates expression of adipose tissue-specific inflammation markers, and reduces gene expression of several chemokines and chemokine receptors (109905)."

            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBleeding. Kaolin-impregnated gauze has shown some benefit for reducing bleeding in various situations, including post-procedural bleeding, postoperative bleeding, and bleeding associated with wound debridement.\nIn patients undergoing PCI or coronary angiography, research on the use of kaolin is conflicting. One clinical study in patients post-PCI shows that femoral artery compression using a kaolin-impregnated gauze (QuikClot Interventional Hemostatic Bandage, Z-Medica) stops bleeding about 20 minutes faster than manual compression alone. Rates of oozing, major or minor bleeding, and vascular complications were similar between the two groups (95080). A similar clinical study shows reduced bleeding times with the same kaolin-impregnated gauze when compared with conventional sterile gauze. In this study, the PCI access route was trans-radial, which can be associated with an increased risk of radial artery occlusion. The kaolin-impregnated gauze was not associated with an increase in the incidence of this complication (101215). Conversely, a clinical study in patients undergoing first-time elective diagnostic coronary angiography with or without PCI via forearm access shows that use of compression with kaolin-impregnated gauze (QuikClot Radial, Z-Medica) is associated with successful hemostasis in 92% of patients, compared with 100% of patients treated with standard mechanical compression control. Procedures performed via trans-radial access were associated with successful hemostasis rates of 90% and 100% in the kaolin and control groups, respectively. Patients receiving kaolin treatment reported less pain regardless of forearm access site, and rates of access complications were similar between groups (105860).\n\nSome research has shown benefit with the use of a specific kaolin-impregnated gauze (QuickClot Combat Gauze, Z-Medica) for postoperative bleeding. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing tonsillectomy shows that postoperative application of this gauze to the wound site stops bleeding faster than applying surgical cotton gauze. About 85% of patients treated with the kaolin-impregnated gauze stopped bleeding within 5 minutes of gauze application, compared with only 35% of patients treated with cotton gauze. The kaolin-impregnated gauze also reduced operating time by 8.5 minutes, intraoperative blood loss by about 20 mL, and number of stiches used by about 2 when compared to surgical cotton gauze (95079). In patients with severe pelvic fractures and associated hemodynamic instability, a retrospective study shows that preperitoneal pelvic packing with this specific kaolin-impregnated gauze and surgical pads is associated with a reduction in 12-hour mean transfusion volume requirement when compared with a control group packed with surgical pads alone. No effect on hemorrhage-induced mortality was observed (105861).\n\nKaolin has also been evaluated for bleeding associated with wound debridement. A small clinical study in outpatients with Wagner grade I or II diabetic foot ulcers who are receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy shows that use of a kaolin-impregnated gauze stops bleeding faster than applying standard sterile dry gauze. Ten of 12 patients treated with kaolin-impregnated gauze stopped bleeding within 5 minutes of application, compared with only 5 of 12 patients treated with standard sterile drug gauze. After 5 more minutes had elapsed, all patients treated with kaolin-impregnated gauze had achieved complete hemostasis, compared with 7 of 12 patients treated with standard sterile drug gauze (105859).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of kaolin for its other uses.\nless\nOral mucositis.

            "Overview": "Kava is a beverage or extract prepared from the root of the tropical shrub Piper methysticum that is native to western Pacific Islands (28489, 29643, 115341). The name \"kava\" is derived from the Polynesian word \"awa\" which means bitter (17086). In the South Pacific, kava is a popular social drink (8414, 9921). Kava has been used for thousands of years by Pacific Islanders as a medicine and for ritual purposes (782, 6240, 28485).",
            "Warnings": "Kava has been associated with numerous cases of hepatotoxicity and was barred from markets in Europe and Canada in 2002. Over time, many countries have lifted the ban on kava after re-evaluation of the evidence (91593, 91594). Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to consumers and healthcare professionals regarding the side effects of kava in 2002, it has never been taken off the market in the US (57334, 57338).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, short-term. Kava extracts have been used safely in clinical trials under medical supervision for up to 6 months (2093, 2094, 2095, 4032, 7325, 15046, 15130, 18314, 18316, 18318)(18320, 29663, 29671, 98980, 102086, 112642). Historically, there has been some concern that kava preparations could induce hepatotoxicity and liver failure in patients taking relatively normal doses, short-term. At least 100 cases of liver toxicity following kava use have been reported. Although liver toxicity is more frequently associated with prolonged use of very high doses (6401, 57346), in some cases the use of kava for as little as 1-3 months has been associated with the need for liver transplants, and even death (390, 7024, 7068, 7086, 7096, 17086, 57252)(57254, 57297). However, some experts question the clinical validity of several of these cases (11369, 11371).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally long-term in high doses.

Tachycardia and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (tall P waves) have been reported in heavy kava users (6402).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, kava can cause allergic skin reactions, including sebotropic eruptions, delayed-type hypersensitivity, or urticarial eruption (4032, 11370, 28489, 57277, 57325, 57343, 114683). In one case of kava-associated urticarial eruption, biopsy revealed neutrophilic sebaceous glands with lymphocytic infiltrate (114683). Chronic use of high doses of kava has also been associated with kava dermopathy, which consists of reddened eyes; dry, scaly, flaky skin; and temporary yellow discoloration of the skin, hair, and nails (6240, 6401, 8414, 8417, 11370, 28485, 57342). This pellagra-like syndrome is unresponsive to niacinamide treatment (6240, 7728, 11370). The cause is unknown, but may relate to interference with cholesterol metabolism (6240). Kava's adverse effects on liver function might also contribute to kava dermopathy (6401, 8417). Kava dermopathy usually occurs within three months to one year of regular kava use, and resolves when the kava dose is decreased or discontinued (6401, 8414). Kava dose should be decreased or discontinued if kava dermopathy occurs (6401). In addition to kava cessation, oral or topical corticosteroids have been described as treatment options in some cases of kava associated dermatitis (114683).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, kava may cause gastrointestinal upset, nausea, or dry mouth (2093, 2094, 4032, 11370, 18316, 57228, 57343).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, chronic use of very high doses of kava has been associated with increased red blood cell volume, reduced platelet volume, reduced lymphocyte counts, and reduced serum albumin (6402, 57258). Hematuria has also been reported anecdotally (6402).\nless\nHepatic\nSince the early 2000's, hepatotoxicity has been a particular concern with kava. Worldwide, there have been at least 100 reported cases of hepatotoxicity following use of kava products (7024, 7068, 7086, 7096, 11795, 17086)(57252, 57254, 57297). However, some experts question the clinical validity of several of these cases (11369, 11371). Some cases were reported multiple times and in some cases it was unlikely that kava was the causative agent (7068, 57253).\n\nIn susceptible patients, symptoms can show up after as little as 3-4 weeks of kava use. Symptoms include yellowed skin (jaundice), fatigue, and dark urine (7024, 7068). Liver function tests can be elevated after 3-8 weeks of use, possibly followed by hepatomegaly and onset of encephalopathy (7024). Kava has also been reported to exacerbate hepatitis in patients with a history of recurrent hepatitis (390). However, in many cases, symptoms seem to resolve spontaneously, and liver function tests usually normalize within eight weeks (390, 7068).\n\nLiver toxicity is more frequently associated with prolonged use of very high doses (6401, 57346). But there is some concern that even short-term use of kava in typical doses might cause acute hepatitis in some patients, including severe hepatocellular necrosis. The use of kava for as little as 1-3 months has resulted in need for liver transplant and death, although these events are rare (7024, 7068, 7086, 7096, 17086).\n\nThere is some speculation that the type of extraction method could be responsible for these rare cases of hepatotoxicity (17086). The \"Pacific kava paradox\" holds that while the alcohol and acetone extracts of kava used for commercial products cause liver toxicity, the traditional kava rhizome preparation mixed with water might not be toxic (11794, 17086). However, a more recent analysis reports cases of hepatotoxicity from the aqueous kava extract and suggests that kava's hepatotoxic effects may be due to contaminants such as mold (29676). Other suggested causes of hepatotoxicity include quality of the kava plant, concomitant medications, large doses and prolonged use, and toxic constituents and metabolites of kava (57300, 88532).\n\nSome commercial kava extracts contain parts of the stems and other aerial parts in addition to the rhizome, and it has been suggested that a constituent called pipermethysine, which is only found in these aerial parts, might be partly responsible for hepatotoxicity (17086). Other constituents of kava which might contribute to hepatotoxicity are kavalactones, which are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the liver. Reactive metabolites are produced which conjugate with glutathione, and might deplete glutathione in a similar manner to acetaminophen (17086). Increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, involved in the production of glutathione, have been reported in chronic kava users (17086). One of the enzymes involved in production of reactive metabolites from kavalactones is cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which is induced by chronic alcohol intake. Alcohol may also compete for other enzymes which clear kavalactone metabolites from the body. This might explain the observation that alcohol ingestion seems to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity with kava (7068, 17086).\n\nThere is also speculation that \"poor metabolizers\" or those patients with deficiency in the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) isoenzyme, which occurs in up to 10% of people of European descent, may be at increased risk for hepatotoxic effects from kava (7068). This deficiency has not been found in Pacific Islanders. However, this theory has not been confirmed.\n\nDue to the concerns regarding the potential hepatotoxicity of kava, kava supplements were withdrawn from European and Canadian markets in 2002 (7086). However, many of the market withdrawals of kava have been lifted after re-evaluation of kava suggested that the risk of hepatotoxicity was minimal (91593, 91594, 91615). Still, clinical practice guidelines from a joint taskforce of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommend exercising caution when using kava in patients with preexisting liver issues (110318). Until more is known, tell patients to use kava cautiously and recommend liver function tests for routine users or those with underlying liver disease.\nless\nImmunologic\nSjögren syndrome has been associated with an herbal supplement containing kava, echinacea, and St. John's wort. Echinacea may have been the primary cause, because Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The role of kava in this syndrome is unclear (10319).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nKava has been linked with reports of rhabdomyolysis. A 34-year-old man who consumed kava tea several times a week developed rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatine kinase level of 32,500 units/liter (18212). However, there is speculation that this might have been due to product impurities rather than kava itself. Another case report describes rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and a creatine kinase level of 100,500 units/liter in a 29-year-old man who had taken kava in combination with guarana and ginkgo biloba (18213).\n\nCases of ataxia and tremors have been reported in patients taking single doses of kava powder 205 grams (11373).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, kava may cause headache, dizziness, and drowsiness (4032, 6402, 11370, 11372, 11373, 18316, 112642). It might also cause extrapyramidal side effects such as involuntary oral and lingual reflexes, twisting movements of the head and trunk, tremors, and other parkinsonian-like symptoms possibly due to dopamine antagonism (534, 4055, 7727, 8415, 102086). In one clinical trial, patients taking a kava supplement providing 120 mg of kavalactones twice daily for 16 weeks had a 3.2-fold greater risk of experiencing tremors when compared with patients taking placebo (102086). Theoretically, kava may worsen symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease or precipitate Parkinson-like symptoms in certain patients (4055, 7727). Unlike benzodiazepines, kava is not thought to be associated with impaired cognitive function (2097, 2098, 11373, 57332, 57333). However, one clinical trial shows that taking a kava supplement providing 120 mg of kavalactones twice daily for 16 weeks increases the risk for memory impairment by 55% when compared with placebo (102086). In one case report, withdrawal after prolonged use of high doses of kava was associated with hyperactive delirium and seizures. Withdrawal was treated with a regimen of intravenous phenobarbital, tapered over 6 days, along with intravenous dexmedetomidine (115341).\n\nOrally, kava may reduce alertness and impair motor coordination in a dose-dependent manner. Some preliminary reports have noted a decline in accuracy of visual attention and slower reaction times after kava ingestion, particularly at higher doses and in combination with alcohol (11373, 95926). Population research has also found that ingesting large amounts of kava tea (typically 50 times higher than what is used medicinally in the US) within a 12-hour period before driving increases the odds of being involved in a serious motor vehicle crash resulting in death or serious injury by almost 5-fold when compared to not drinking kava tea (95927). Use of normal doses of kava may also affect the ability to drive or operate machinery, and driving under the influence (DUI) citations have been issued to individuals observed driving erratically after drinking large amounts of kava tea (535). However, in computer-based driving simulator tests, there are no reported adverse effects of kava on performance (95926). Additionally, other research shows that consuming over 4400 mg of kavalactones over a 6-hour kava session does not seem to impair alertness or attention when compared with non-kava drinkers (103867). Similar research using a specific psychometric tool (Brain Gauge) shows that consuming approximately 3680 mg of kavalactones in a 6-hour kava session seems to impair temporal order judgment, which is associated with the brain's ability to track the order of events, when compared with non-kava drinkers. However, it does not seem to impact cognitive domains related to focus, accuracy, timing perception, plasticity, or fatigue when compared with non-kava drinkers (110435).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, high doses of kava may cause eye irritation (7728).

Oral kava seems to improve anxiety when taken for at least 5 weeks.\nMost clinical research shows that kava extracts 150-400 mg, standardized to 70% kavalactones, daily are superior to placebo for relieving symptoms of non-psychotic anxiety (2094, 2095, 11372, 18315, 18316, 18317, 18320, 98980), and are possibly comparable to buspirone 10 mg or low-dose benzodiazepines such as oxazepam 30 mg (18314). However, kava may not be effective for improving subthreshold anxiety. A meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in patients with subthreshold anxiety shows that taking kava does not improve anxiety symptoms when compared with placebo (110711). Overall, kava's effects appear to be dose-dependent and duration-dependent. One meta-analysis suggests that taking more than 200 mg kavalactones daily tends to be more beneficial for anxiety than taking less than 200 mg kavalactones daily (98980). Some clinical research also suggests that kava extract must be taken for at least 5 weeks to provide a benefit (2094, 15046, 18314, 98980), while single-dose treatments may not be beneficial for acute anxiety (18319). Most studies have used a specific standardized extract (WS 1490, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 150-300 mg daily. Another specific kava extract (LI 150, Lichtwer Pharma) 400 mg daily has also been used (18314, 98980).\n\nClinical practice guidelines from a joint taskforce of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) conclude that there is evidence supporting the use of kava for acute or short-term management of general anxiety symptoms but that only products standardized to a sufficient level of kavalactones should be recommended (110318).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral kava doesn't seem to be effective for treating GAD.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small, low-quality clinical studies in adults with GAD shows that kava extract standardized to 70% kavalactones, providing 140-280 mg kavalactones daily, is no more effective than placebo when used for 4-8 weeks (15130). Additionally, a more recent meta-analysis of 3 moderate-sized clinical trials in patients diagnosed with GAD shows that taking kava does not reduce anxiety when compared with placebo or conventional therapy (110711). While a small clinical trial in adults with GAD shows that taking kava rootstock extract, standardized to provide 120-240 mg of kavalactones daily, for 6 weeks reduces clinician rated anxiety scores when compared with placebo (29663), a large, multi-center clinical trial from the same research group shows that taking kava root extract standardized to 120 mg of kavalactones twice daily for 16 weeks does not reduce anxiety scores when compared with placebo in adults diagnosed with GAD (102086).\n\nClinical practice guidelines from a joint taskforce of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends against the use of kava rootstock extracts (standardized to 60-250 mg kavalactones) as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients with GAD (110318). This recommendation against kava for GAD is based on high quality evidence from a meta-analysis and two additional clinical trials, along with a meta-review of two meta-analyses on the use of kava for GAD (110318, 112133).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBenzodiazepine withdrawal. It is unclear if oral kava is beneficial for reducing benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.\nOne small clinical study in patients with non-psychotic anxiety shows that titrating a specific kava extract (WS1490, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) up to 300 mg daily over one week while tapering the benzodiazepine over 2 weeks is no more effective than placebo for decreasing benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms (7325).\nless\nCancer.

However, another internet-based clinical trial in patients with self-reported insomnia associated with anxiety suggests that taking kava in a dose equivalent to 100 mg kavalactones three times daily for 4 weeks does not improve sleep when compared with placebo (15046).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral kava is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking kava 100-200 mg standardized to contain 55% kavaina daily for 3 months reduces depression, anxiety, and hot flashes when compared to baseline in perimenopausal patients. However, the changes in depression and hot flashes were not better when compared with the control group that took calcium (18318).\nless\nMyalgia.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans taking a single 75-mg oral dose of standardized kava extract, the maximum plasma concentrations of kavain, dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin, and yangonin, which are all kavalactones, were approximately 26 ng/mL, 55 ng/mL, 7 ng/mL, 33 ng/mL, and 1 ng/mL, respectively, and occurred in 1-3 hours. When a single 225-mg dose was taken, maximum concentrations were approximately 3-fold higher and occurred in the same time frame, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics. Another kavalactone, desmethoxyyangonin, was not consistently present in plasma samples. In patients taking a regimen of 75 mg three times daily, the duration of exposure was increased when compared with a single 225-mg dose (110436).\n\nTaking kava extract with food appears to reduce absorption (110436). Also, laboratory research suggests that there may be no difference in absorption or bioavailability of kavalactones extracted by water or ethanol (57290).\nDistribution\nSome research suggests that kavain (Klinge Pharma), a synthetic derivative of kava, has a distribution half-life of 50 minutes (57348).\nMetabolism\nIn a study of the metabolism of several kavalactones in male rats, it was observed that about one-half of the 400 mg/kg dose of dihydrokavain administered was found in the urine in 48 hours (57318).

The remaining one-third consisted of metabolites formed by the catabolism of the kavalactones and also included hippuric acid.\nExcretion\nMetabolites and unchanged lactones of kava are excreted in human urine and feces (57312). Some research suggests that kavain (Klinge Pharma), a synthetic derivative of kava, has an elimination half-life of approximately 9 hours (57348).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of kava are the rhizome, root, and stem. Pharmacological activity has largely been attributed to kavalactones (also known as kavapyrones). The six most common kavalactones in kava plants are desmethoxyyangonin, 7,8-dihydrokavain, yangonin, kavain, 7,8-dihydromethysticin, and methysticin (9920, 9923, 90883, 90884). The dried herb typically contains at least 3.5% kava-lactones. Kava is traditionally prepared by water extraction from the fresh root. Kava is prepared commercially with ethanol, yielding 30% kava-lactones or acetone, yielding 70% kava-lactones (9920, 9921).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that kavalactones produce analgesic effects (57350, 57351, 57316, 57314, 57352, 57317, 57353, 57354). Analgesia is not believed to occur by the opiate pathway because naloxone does not reverse the effects of kava (57311, 57309). Furthermore, kava is thought to produce motor sedation without affecting respiratory processes (2095). When chewed, kava root reportedly numbs the mouth similar to cocaine (1740).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nKava is thought to work for a variety of inflammatory conditions by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, the enzymes responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (8413). Also, preliminary research shows that kavain and flavokavains A and B inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which may result in anti-inflammatory effects (57279).\nAnticarcinogenic effects\nClinical research in active smokers shows that taking a kava supplement providing 75 mg of kavalactones three times daily for 7 days increases the excretion of nitrosamine-based carcinogens (103868). It is unclear whether kava can reduce lung cancer risk among smokers.\nAnticoagulant effects\nThere is some evidence the kavapyrone (+)-kavain has antithrombotic activity. By inhibiting cyclooxygenase and decreasing the synthesis of thromboxane A2, (+)-kavain appears to decrease the aggregation of platelets (2501).\nAnxiolytic properties\nKava has been found to have a variety of pharmacological effects, including anxiolytic and sedative effects (57255). However, the exact mechanism for these effects is not known. Some laboratory evidence suggests the sedative effects may be due to an increase in the number of GABA binding sites (4037, 8440, 9923). In humans with generalized anxiety disorder, taking kava results in decreased GABA levels in a specific region of the brain involved in emotion, the dorsal anterior cingulate complex (112642). Also in these patients, the expression of a gene coding for a subunit of the GABA-A-rho receptor was decreased, as was the expression for a gene coding for an enzyme involved in catecholamine metabolism (112643). It is unclear if the peripheral measurement of expression of these genes reflects gene expression in the brain.\nCYP450 effects\nMost preliminary research suggests that kava may inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP1A2 (8743, 12479, 88593), CYP2C19 (8743, 12479), CYP2C9 (8743, 12479), CYP2D6 (8743, 12479, 88593), CYP2E1 (13536), and CYP3A4 (8743, 12479). Kava extracts also appear to activate human pregnane X receptor (PXR) (57362).\nHepatic effects\nHepatotoxicity of kava may be related to intracellular glutathione depletion and/or quinone formation (57292). Laboratory research suggests that kavalactones alone cause more toxicity and cell death compared to kavalactones with glutathione. Aqueous kava extracts contain glutathione, while acetone extracts do not (57262). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking single, large doses of kava such as an average of 440 grams per week or 205 grams of kava powder (150 times greater than a normal dose) results in elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels compared to non-use (6402, 11373, 57291).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nSome research suggests that kava can produce muscle paralysis by a mechanism similar to local anesthetics such as cocaine (9924).\nNeurologic effects\nKava doesn't seem to impair cognitive function (2097, 2098, 11373). Even at intoxicating doses, the only cognitive impairment observed with kava is a decline in accuracy of visual attention (11373). Some evidence suggests kava may affect the limbic system (6002). People consuming kava have reported feeling more sociable, tranquil, and generally happy (1740). The kavapyrones desmethoxyyangonin and methysticin appear to competitively inhibit monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) (2500). Preliminary research suggests that a kava extract may protect rodents from ischemic brain damage induced by ischemia and also promote recovery (57263, 57364). Pyrones from kava have been noted for their anticonvulsive and hypnotic effects (57314, 57316, 57317, 57350, 57351, 57352, 57353, 57354). These effects may result from calcium channel agonism (57365), sodium channel blocking (57322, 57324, 57366), and/or inhibition of noradrenaline uptake (8740). Kava seemed to facilitate GABA transmission and may have similar activity to GABA agonists (57367, 57333). Some research suggests that kava and its constituents may affect glutamate (57320), dopamine (9923), serotonin (9923, 57365). However, other preliminary research suggests that kava constituents do not affect dopamine or serotonin levels in rodents (57326)."

It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy adults or recreational athletes shows that taking kefir 16 ounces once daily or twice weekly for up to 15 weeks does not improve running times or recovery when compared with control (95312, 115876). However, another very small clinical study in healthy, untrained males shows that taking kefir 20 grams, rehydrated with 200 mL of water, daily for 4 weeks prolongs time to exhaustion and reduces lactate levels during exercise and recovery when compared with placebo (112041).\nless\nBronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial for the prevention of CVD.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in patients with various conditions associated with an increased risk for CVD, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, shows that taking kefir 180-600 mL daily for 3-12 weeks does not improve body weight, lipid levels, or measures of glycemic control when compared with control (112047). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, which included a range of doses, durations of therapy, and patient populations.\nless\nCerebral palsy. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in children with cerebral palsy.\nA small clinical study in children aged 4-8 years with moderate-to-severe spastic cerebral palsy shows that taking kefir 250 mL daily for 7 weeks reduces measures of constipation and stool hardness when compared to baseline. Significant improvements in these outcomes were lacking in children taking a control yogurt (112048). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of statistical comparison between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial for preventing CINV.\nA small clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer shows that taking kefir 500 mL daily for 1 week during chemotherapy treatment does not reduce gastrointestinal adverse events or improve quality of life when compared with no treatment. Furthermore, taking kefir might increase some adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, mouth sores, drowsiness, sweats, and hair loss, by a small amount (95310).\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with constipation.\nA small clinical study in adults with chronic constipation shows that taking kefir 500 mL daily for 4 weeks increases weekly median stool frequency 2.5-fold when compared to baseline. Stool consistency is also normalized in 50% of the adults reporting hard stool consistency at baseline (95314). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with Crohn disease.\nA small clinical study in adults with Crohn disease shows that taking kefir 200 mL twice daily for 4 weeks reduces feelings of bloating and improves overall symptoms when compared to baseline (101177). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in healthy individuals or patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or overweight shows that taking kefir 180-1200 mL daily for 2-12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by around 10 mg/dL but does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with control (112040). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, which included a range of doses, durations of therapy, and patient populations.\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nFood allergies. It is unclear if oral kefir during pregnancy or breast-feeding is beneficial for the prevention of cow's milk protein allergy in children.\nObservational research suggests that higher intake of kefir during pregnancy, but not breast-feeding, might be associated with a lower likelihood of cow's milk protein allergy development in children at 1-3 years of age (112049).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.\nA small clinical study in patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection shows that taking kefir 250 mL twice daily for 2 weeks increases the rate of H. pylori eradication by 56% when compared with placebo milk. All patients were also receiving triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (95309).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nA very small clinical study in males with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking kefir 500 mL daily for up to 4 weeks does not improve total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo milk or baseline measures (7636).\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nInsomnia. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nLactose intolerance. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir in individuals with lactose intolerance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with menopausal symptoms and sleep problems shows that taking kefir 250 mL twice daily for 1 month improves sleep quality by approximately 67% when compared with a control group taking no kefir. Kefir also seems to improve vasomotor, physical, and sexual symptoms associated with menopause (101180).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Small clinical studies suggest that oral kefir does not improve body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or glycemic control in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with metabolic syndrome show that taking kefir 180 mL daily for 12 weeks does not improve body weight or composition, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or glycemic indices when compared with unfermented milk (101176, 112046).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nA small clinical study in females with overweight or obesity shows that eating 2 servings of dairy products as kefir, as part of a weight maintenance diet for 8 weeks, reduces body weight by 1.4 kg when compared to a weight maintenance diet alone. However, kefir was no more effective than including 2 servings of dairy products as low-fat milk in the diet (95311).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial for the prevention of oral mucositis.\nA small clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer shows that receiving an oral lavage with kefir followed by swallowing kefir 250 mL twice daily after meals for the first 5 days of a 5-flurouracil chemotherapy cycle does not reduce the development of mucositis when compared to oral lavage with sodium chloride for 5 days (57383).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with osteoporosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoporosis shows that taking kefir 1600 mg plus calcium carbonate 1500 mg daily for 6 months does not improve bone density when compared with calcium carbonate alone (95313).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nTuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral kefir for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of kefir for this purpose.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical study in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking kefir 200 mL twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve abdominal pain or bloating when compared to baseline (101177). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis. It is unclear if oral kefir is beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that taking kefir 100 mL daily for 8 weeks improves most measures of skin hydration and reduces the severity of atopic dermatitis, but does not improve erythema, when compared with patients not taking kefir (112044).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate kefir for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nKefir is most often used at doses of 400-500 mL daily for up to 4 weeks. Lower doses, 100-180 mL daily, have been used for up to 12 weeks.

Fermentation occurred over 12-24 hours (95312, 95314). The kefir grains were removed by filtration (95312, 95314) or added in sterilized cotton tea bags to prevent the need for removal (95312). Prepared kefir is stored in a refrigerator (95312, 95314). Freeze-dried kefir has also been used in clinical research (95313).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of kefir.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nKefir consists of milk that has been fermented following the addition of kefir grain. Kefir grains resemble cooked cauliflower and contain a mixture of various types of bacteria, yeasts, and their excreted viscous polysaccharide products (95310, 95314). The bacteria and yeast differ depending on where the kefir is made. Bacteria include lactobacilli, lactococci, leuconostocs, and acetobacteria. Yeast species are both lactose fermenting and non-fermenting, and might include Streptococcus thermophilus, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida species (8485, 57379, 95310, 95314, 101176, 101177). Kefir can be made using cow, goat, or sheep milk, as well as plant milks such as coconut, rice, and soy. Most kefir is made from cow milk (95310). Fermentation results in the production of lactic and acetic acids, carbon dioxide, alcohol, and other compounds (95310). Also, during fermentation, kefir becomes increasingly viscous due to the formation of additional kefiran glucogalactan polysaccharides by the lactic acid bacteria (8481, 8482, 8483, 8484, 95314).\nBone effects\nAlthough the effects of kefir on bone health in humans are not clear, there is some evidence to suggest that kefir consumption has beneficial effects on bone turnover (95313).\nDental effects\nThere is some interest in using kefir to prevent dental carries associated with Streptococcus mutans. A small clinical study in children undergoing restorations for dental caries shows that taking kefir 100 mL daily for 1 month after dental restoration reduces salivary Streptococcus mutans colony-forming units when compared with a control group. Researchers theorize that kefir might aid in the prevention of dental caries by competing with pathogenic bacteria in the mouth (112045).\nDermal effects\nThere is some interest in using kefir to improve skin hydration. A small clinical study in healthy females shows that taking kefir 100 mL daily for 8 weeks improves certain measures of skin hydration; however, the mechanism of this effect is unclear (112042).\nHypotensive effects\nThere is interest in using kefir and other probiotics to lower blood pressure. In an animal hypertensive model, kefir treatment reduced blood pressure, possibly by mechanisms related to inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy and improving heart function. Kefir might also regulate the levels of some proteins involved in the contraction of the heart (101179).\nImmune effects\nEarly evidence indicates that oral kefiran polysaccharide may increase both the intestinal and systemic immune response (8488, 8489). This immune response may decrease the growth of carcinoma and sarcoma cells (8481, 8482, 8489).\nLactose effects\nThe beta-galactosidase in kefir can facilitate the breakdown of lactose in the gastrointestinal tract, according to preliminary evidence. This action may increase the absorption of galactose and glucose after consuming milk (8485). The lactose found in milk decreases from 5% to about 3.6% during fermentation of kefir (8486).\nLaxative effects\nIn human research, kefir shortens transit time through the colon (95314).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research suggests that kefir might improve various markers associated with metabolic disease. In mice consuming a high-fat diet, kefir reduces body weight, adipose tissue, and hepatic steatosis and improves glucose tolerance, possibly through alteration of the composition of gut microbiota and regulation of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and glucose homeostasis (112043).\nProbiotic effects\nLactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus helveticus, and other Lactobacillus species may be present in kefir. In addition, Streptococcus thermophilus and yeast species, including Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida species may be isolated (8485). Many of these species can survive transit through the stomach and inoculate the intestinal tract (8487, 57382, 101176, 101177, 101178)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Khat is a flowering evergreen plant native to tropical East Africa. Its leaves have been traditionally used as a stimulant (95229). Khat is banned in various countries, including the United States and Canada. However, it remains legal in many countries. In the United Kingdom, khat is a controlled drug. It is still used in North America and Europe by immigrant populations from countries with a high rate of traditional use (95231, 95239, 98510).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Khat leaf is not physically addicting but is associated with psychological dependence (6). High doses of khat can cause paranoia, psychosis, and aggression (10120).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Khat has been associated with reducing maternal food intake, maternal weight, infant birth weight, and placental blood flow. It has also been associated with an increased risk for chest pain, elevated heart rate, and high blood pressure during pregnancy (95241).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Khat has been associated with a reduction in breast milk production (95241). Also, khat contains compounds that are metabolized to norpseudoephedrine, which passes into breast milk (6); avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Khat has been associated with euphoria, excessive talkativeness, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, anxiety, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and manic behavior. High doses of khat have been reported to cause depressed mood, paranoia and psychosis (10120, 57391, 57410, 57420, 57422). Other serious adverse effects reported in individual cases or case series include migraine, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral vasoconstriction, myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary edema, and hepatic cirrhosis and/or encephalopathy (6, 57402, 95230, 95237, 95238, 95239, 98511).\n\nWithdrawal symptoms, including, irritation, nervousness, depression, loss of appetite, trembling, hot extremities, sleep problems, and nightmares, have been reported in chronic users of khat (95235).\n\nOrally, chewing khat leaves has been reported to cause infection with Fasciola hepatica and Campylobacter fetus. This is likely due to contamination of freshly picked, damp leaves (6464, 95233).\nCardiovascular\nOrally, khat has been reported to cause tachycardia, palpitations, and increased blood pressure; however, tolerance to these effects seems to develop with continued use (57388, 57403, 57412, 98510). Chewing khat for at least 6 hours per day has been associated with an approximately 39-fold increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) (57402, 95237).\nless\nDental\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause increased plaque and gingivitis, periodontal pocketing, bleeding, tooth detachment, and gum recession (95242, 95244, 98509). Analysis of available clinical research shows that habitual khat chewing increases the odds of gingival recession by 7-fold when compared with non-chewers (98509).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, chewing khat has been associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (106447).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chewing khat has been associated with an increased risk for stomatitis, esophagitis, gastritis, keratosis of the buccal mucosa (6), and hemorrhoids (57389). The increased risk for hemorrhoids is theorized to be a complication of constipation (57389). Khat has been reported to cause dry mouth (95237), decreased appetite, and anorexia (57425).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause an initial increase in male libido followed by loss of sexual drive, spermatorrhea, and impotence (6). Khat has also been reported to cause urinary retention (95237).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause livery injury in at least a few dozen cases, with symptoms including jaundice, fatigue, pruritus, anorexia, abdominal pain, and dark urine (95228, 95231, 95234, 95238, 95239, 106452, 106453, 106454). In some cases, liver injury has resolved after discontinuation of khat consumption (106452, 106453, 106454). However, khat-induced liver injury has also involved cirrhosis, fibrosis (95238, 95239), autoimmune hepatitis (106452, 106453, 106454), or hepatic encephalopathy (95239), sometimes with progression to death or liver failure requiring transplantation (95231, 95238, 95239). Liver injury has occurred in acute and chronic users of khat, with exposure ranging from intermittent use for as few as 4 weeks (95231) to 100 grams daily for as long as 25 years (95228). Most cases of hepatitis associated with khat have occurred in Europe, North America, or Australia, in immigrants from countries with traditional use. Some physicians in East Africa state that the absence of hepatotoxicity related to khat in Africa implies that any toxicity seen in other countries might be related to concomitant use with alcohol and/or potential contamination (95232).\n\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause acute liver disease due to fascioliasis, or liver flute infection, in Somalian males living in the Netherlands. Fascioliasis symptoms include abdominal pain, eosinophilia, jaundice, and pruritus and typically resolve after treatment. The occurrence of fascioliasis after chewing khat is likely due to Fasciola hepatica contamination of freshly picked, damp leaves (6464, 95233).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause temporomandibular joint dysfunction (6).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, khat can cause euphoria, excessive talkativeness, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, anxiety, and manic behavior. After use, insomnia, malaise, and lack of concentration have been reported (6). Khat has been reported to cause migraine and cerebral hemorrhage (6).\n\nRarely, khat has been associated with encephalopathy, intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) (95230, 95240, 98511). In one case report, a 45-year-old male who had consumed \"copious\" but unknown amounts of khat developed hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and acute toxic leukoencephalopathy. After recovery, the patient remained non-verbal and unable to walk independently (98511). In another case report, one patient developed headache, heavy tongue, and one-sided weakness one week postpartum from the tenth pregnancy, which was diagnosed as RCVS. Because postpartum RCVS typically occurs following the first three pregnancies, the authors suggested that chewing khat acted as the precipitating factor; however, this could not be confirmed (95230).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause pupil dilation and to reduce intraocular pressure (6).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, khat has been reported to cause mood swings and depressed mood (57391). High doses of khat have been reported to cause paranoia and psychosis, including strange experiences and hallucinations (10120, 57410, 57420, 57422, 106449). In one cross-sectional study, such symptoms occurred more frequently in female and younger khat chewers (106449). Similarly, a meta-analysis shows that khat chewers are 2 times more likely to develop common mental disorders than non-chewers (106450). In one case report, a 33-year-old male with a history of prolonged and heavy khat chewing and no family history of psychiatric illness experienced psychotic symptoms, including visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, and a suicide attempt. Symptoms fully resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuation of khat consumption (106451). True psychotic reactions with khat chewing seem to occur less frequently than with amphetamine usage (6).\n\nOrally, khat has been reported to cause psychological dependence. In one cohort of khat chewers living in the United Kingdom, approximately 31% reported symptoms related to dependence, including an increase in khat chewing due to cravings (95235). Consistent use of khat followed by abrupt discontinuation is associated with withdrawal symptoms, including irritation, nervousness, depression, loss of appetite, trembling, hot extremities, sleep problems, and nightmares (95235). Some cases of khat addiction have been successfully treated with bromocriptine (57390, 57396).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause pulmonary edema and also has been associated with reductions in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and maximum ventilation volume (6, 106444).\nless\nOther\nOrally, chewing khat has been reported to cause infection from Fasciola hepatica and campylobacter fetus. There are multiple reports of acute liver disease due to fascioliasis, or liver flute infection, in Somalian males living in the Netherlands. Fascioliasis symptoms include abdominal pain, eosinophilia, jaundice, and pruritus and typically resolve after treatment (6464, 95233). In one case report, a 28-year-old male developed a Campylobacter fetus infection involving fever, chills, diarrhea, reduced appetite, and headache (95236). In all cases, the occurrence of infection after chewing khat was likely due to contamination of freshly picked, damp leaves (6464, 95233, 95236).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Khat is traditionally used to control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, but effects on glycemic control are variable. A meta-analysis of available clinical research in nondiabetic adults shows that chewing khat leaves does not affect blood glucose levels. In adults with type 2 diabetes, chewing khat leaves increases blood glucose levels within 2 hours of use (95229). Also, a large cross-sectional study in adults shows that chewing khat is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with non-chewers. However, no association between chewing khat and glycemic control was found (106447).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nMuscle strength. A small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of khat powder 45 grams in juice does not improve grip strength when compared with placebo in healthy males (98510).\nSchizophrenia. A large, retrospective study in adults with newly diagnosed schizophrenia receiving monotherapy with an initial antipsychotic agent shows that chewing khat is associated with an initial antipsychotic agent retention rate of 54%, compared with a retention rate of 78% among non-chewers. Lack of efficacy was the most commonly reported reason for switching antipsychotic agents among khat chewers (106448). The validity of these findings is limited by the use of a retrospective chart review.\nMore evidence is needed to rate khat for these uses.",

Until more is known, avoid khat in patients taking antipsychotic agents.\nCHLOROQUINE (Aralen)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nChewing khat after taking chloroquine appears to decrease the absorption of chloroquine. Chewing khat reduces the chloroquine area under the curve (AUC) by 25% and the peak plasma concentration by 18.3%. However, in patients with malaria, chewing khat did not significantly reduce the rate of treatment success with chloroquine compared to patients that did not chew khat (95243). Chewing khat while taking chloroquine reduces the absorption of chloroquine and might reduce the efficacy of chloroquine. Until more is known, people taking chloroquine for the treatment or prevention of malaria should avoid chewing khat.\nMONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nIn one case report, a 24-year-old man developed reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) thought to be caused by chewing khat in combination with treatment with tranylcypromine, an MAOI. Theoretically, the combination of khat and an MAOI might increase the induction of sympathetic stimulation, increasing the risk of vasoconstriction (95240). Until more is known, avoid khat in patients taking MAOIs and for 14 days after MAOI discontinuation.\nSTIMULANT DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nCathinone, a constituent of khat, appears to have sympathomimetic effects and can increase blood pressure and heart rate (57408). Theoretically, combining khat with other central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drugs might increase the risk of cardiovascular toxicity. Some CNS stimulants include nicotine, cocaine, sympathomimetic amines, and amphetamines.\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nChewing khat might decrease the effects of warfarin.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing a khat chewing session, maximum plasma levels of three major constituents, cathinone, cathine, and norephedrine, occurred between 2.3 and 2.8 hours (57394, 57418).\nMetabolism\nCathinone is metabolized to norepinephrine (57394, 57411).\nExcretion\nFollowing a khat chewing session, the elimination half-lives of cathinone and cathine are approximately 1.5 and 5.2 hours, respectively (57394). The constituents and their metabolites are excreted in the urine (57394, 57411, 57418).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of khat are the leaf and stem. The main constituents of khat are the phenylalkylamines cathine and cathinone, and the cathidulins. Cathinone, which comprises 70% of the phenylalkylamines in fresh khat leaves, is converted to cathine and norephedrine after harvest, as well as during storage and with drying. Thus, khat leaves are considered most potent when fresh (95229, 95237, 95239). Khat also contains norephedrine, terpenoids, flavonoids, sterols, glycosides, and tannins (95229, 95237, 95239).\nAdrenergic effects\nChewing khat has been reported to decrease the average and maximum urine flow rate. This effect can be inhibited by indoramin. It has been suggested that the stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors is the likely mechanism for the effect of khat on urination (57415).\nAntidiabetic effects\nKhat is traditionally used to lower levels of blood glucose in people with diabetes. However, animal research does not consistently support this use. Animal research has involved the use of various animal species, diabetic and nondiabetic animals, different forms of khat, and varying dosages and lengths of exposure (95229). This has made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Additionally, chewing khat has been associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes in humans in a cross-sectional study, and variable effects on blood glucose levels have been observed (106447). Research has found that khat has no effect on blood glucose levels in healthy humans and may actually increase blood glucose levels in adults with diabetes. It is theorized that the increase in blood glucose is due to antagonization of insulin activity (95229).\nCardiovascular effects\nKhat and its constituent, cathinone, have been reported to increase blood pressure and heart rate (57388, 57403, 57408). Heavy use of khat has been associated with an approximately 39-fold increased risk for a myocardial infarction (57402, 95237). This is possibly due to increased cardiac vasospasm (95237). A cross-sectional study in adults has found that chewing khat is associated with increased blood flow velocity parameters, including resistivity and pulsatility indices, in the common carotid arteries when compared with not chewing khat (106445).\nCognitive effects\nAlthough khat has traditional use as a stimulant, it has been shown to slow reaction time with long-term use in humans (98510).\nDental effects\nKhat has been associated with various adverse dental effects, including periodontal pocketing, bleeding, tooth detachment, and gum recession (95242, 95244, 98509). One possible mechanism for these effects is the presence of pesticides in the chewed khat, which can cause a progression of coexisting periodontal disease or an impairment of fibroblast function. Another possible mechanism is theorized to be microtrauma to the tissues from constant chewing and/or impaction of pieces of khat. Also, these adverse effects might be related to other habits commonly associated with khat chewing, such as intake of sweetened drinks and use of toothpicks. There is no evidence to suggest that khat chewing increases the growth of pathogenic bacteria (98509).\nHypertensive effects\nThe effects of khat on increased blood pressure are likely related to its constituent cathinone. Cathinone and its metabolites has been observed to cause coronary and arterial vasoconstriction (57398, 95237).\nPsychiatric effects\nA large cross-sectional study among households in geographic areas with high khat production shows that chewing khat is associated with psychotic symptoms, including strange experiences and hallucinations, and these symptoms occur more frequently in female and younger khat chewers (106449). A meta-analysis of studies in Ethiopian college students shows that khat chewers are 2 times more likely to develop common mental disorders than non-chewers (106450).\nPulmonary effects\nA cross-sectional study in adults has found that chewing khat is associated with reductions in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and maximum ventilation volume, but not other lung function parameters or oxygen saturation, when compared with no history of chewing khat (106444).\nStimulatory effects\nCathinone is considered to be the main psychoactive component in khat. Cathinone, which closely resembles ephedrine and amphetamine in chemical structure, appears to stimulate the presynaptic release of dopamine and prevent its re-uptake (95237). Cathine, another psychoactive constituent of khat, is considered less potent than cathinone, with 10% of the stimulant activity of d-amphetamine. Fresh khat leaves have the highest stimulant potency, as cathinone begins to degrade after harvest and with storage and drying (10120, 57397)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of khella are the dried, ripe fruits (7161). Khella has several constituents with known pharmacological activity, including visnadin, visnagin, and khellin (8, 2525). Visnagin (4-methoxy-7-methyl-5H-furo[3,2-g][1]-benzopyran-5- one) is a furanocoumarin derivative (112076).\nAnti-apoptotic effects\nIn rats, visnagin 30-60 mg/kg reduces apoptosis in models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and myocardial injury. It downregulates the pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, and upregulates the anti-apoptotic gene, Bc12, and also decreases the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9, thereby interfering with the apoptotic cascade (112075, 112076).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn rats, visnagin 30-60 mg/kg reduces inflammation in models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and myocardial injury. It reduces levels of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-beta, nuclear factor kappa-B, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It also upregulates the heme oxygenase-1 gene, preventing vascular inflammation (112075, 112076).\nAntiarthritic effects\nIn a rat model of osteoarthritis, intra-articular injection of 50 microliters of a formulation of khellin increases the pain threshold, improves motor skills, and reduces synovial hyperplasia and vascularity. These effects last up to 14 days after a single dose when the injection is formulated as khellin solution, 2 mg/mL loaded into nanovesicles of ascorbyl decanoate. A plain suspension of khellin 0.3 mg/mL only has activity for up to 7 days, and only has the effect of raising the pain threshold (112077).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, a khella extract seems to have some antimicrobial activity. This might be attributable to both the khellin and visnagin constituents, which both seem to have antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activity (1907).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn rats, visnagin 30-60 mg/kg has antioxidant activity in models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and myocardial injury. It decreases expression of the marker of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde, and increases the activity of the antioxidants, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. It also upregulates the transcription factor Nrf-2 which increases the cellular response to oxidative stress (112075, 112076).\nBronchodilator effects\nKhella is traditionally used for asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses. The khellin constituent has bronchodilatory activity (9).\nCardiovascular effects\nKhella is traditionally used for angina, arrhythmia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The constituents visnadin, visnagin, and khellin have cardiovascular effects due to calcium channel blocking activity (8, 2525). Visnadin is the most active. It can inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction, dilate peripheral and coronary vessels, and increase coronary circulation (8, 9, 2523, 2524). Visnagin has negative chronotropic and inotropic effects and reduces peripheral vascular resistance (869). The khellin constituent acts as a vasodilator (9). There is some preliminary evidence that khellin might also increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels without affecting total cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations (2522).\n\nIn rats, visnagin 15-60 mg/kg orally daily for 14 days reduces myocardial injury and pathological changes induced by high doses of isoproterenol. Mechanisms include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. Heart weight is also reduced, along with levels of cardiac troponin-1, myocardial creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (112076).\nCerebral ischemia effects\nIn a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, treatment with visnagin 30 or 60 mg/kg improves cognitive function, including learning and memory. Mechanisms include reduction in inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (112075).\nDermatological effects\nResearchers are interested in khella for use in psoriasis. The khellin constituent is structurally similar to the psoralen nucleus and might be useful as a photosensitizer in patients with psoriasis (1908)."

Some observational research suggests that anaphylaxis after consuming kiwi fruit is more common when compared with other fruits, especially in children. Of 250 patients reporting to the emergency department for fruit-induced anaphylaxis, around 16% reported kiwi fruit as the culprit, followed by banana (11%) and mango (9%) (109591). Rarely, exercise may trigger an anaphylactic reaction to kiwi fruit in individuals with no history of kiwi fruit allergy (109592).\n\nTopically, kiwi can cause contact urticaria (6). Topical application of kiwi may also cause hypersensitivity reactions, which are more common in patients who are allergic to latex (6197, 7853).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, anaphylactic reactions and kiwi allergy-induced asthma exacerbations have been reported after eating kiwi fruit (51576, 57464, 57492, 57497, 57617, 57624, 57625, 57635, 109591, 109592).\nless",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of kiwi is the fruit. Kiwi fruit contains high levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, serotonin, and potassium (6, 57643). It is estimated that 100 mg of vitamin C is contained in one kiwi fruit (57476). It also contains approximately 4.5 mg/kg of catechins (57466). Substantial amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin (30-50%) are also present in kiwi fruit (3224). Other kiwi constituents include triterpenoids, flavonoids, carotenoids, chlorophylls, anthocyanins, oxalate, sugars, proteins, and other organic compounds (57473, 57494, 57506, 57509, 57511, 57512, 57522, 57555, 57560, 57563)(57585). Kiwi also contains an anionic proteinase enzyme called actinidin, which has proteolytic activity similar to papain (6, 57609). Other enzymes isolated from kiwi include pectin methylesterase (and its inhibitor) (57467, 57502, 57504, 57568, 57585, 57632) and glycosyltransferases (57573). Over 30 different constituents appear to contribute to the aroma of kiwi fruit (57479).\nAnti-asthma effects\nThe potential benefits of kiwi in asthma are thought to be due to the antioxidant properties of vitamin C or other fruit constituents (6049, 6054, 6055).\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nClinical research in humans shows that consuming three kiwi fruits daily reduces levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (103293).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that extracts of kiwi fruit, leaves, and stems have some antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (57541).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that certain constituents and extracts of kiwi have cytotoxic effects against some cancer cell lines (57477, 57509, 57550, 57563). The antitumor effects of a polysaccharide from kiwi have been shown in animals (57595).\nAntifungal activity\nIn vitro research shows that a protein constituent of gold kiwi fruit, called actinchinin, has antifungal effects against Fusarium oxysporum (57494). A different, thaumatin-like protein from kiwi fruit has been shown to have antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea, Mycosphaerella arachidicola, and Coprinus comatus (57478).\nAntioxidant effects\nClinical research in humans shows that consuming one or two kiwi fruits daily raises plasma vitamin C levels, increases resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, and decreases purine and pyrimidine oxidation (57581). Other human research shows that consuming three kiwi fruits daily for 8 weeks modulates the expression of proteins related to cell defense processes in males (57566). In vitro and animal studies also show that kiwi fruit has antioxidant activity, in large part, but not entirely due to its vitamin C content (57472, 57517, 57547, 57575).\nAntiplatelet effects\nStudies in humans show that consuming 1-3 kiwi fruits daily can inhibit platelet aggregation (57498, 57581). The mechanism of this effect is unknown.\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome research shows that actinidin, a proteinase enzyme found in kiwi, enhances the digestion of gastric protein, including papsin and pancreatin, in an in vitro gastric digestion model (57561, 57562).\nLipid-lowering effects\nAnimal research shows that kiwi fruit can decrease total cholesterol and triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (103294). However, human research shows that consuming one or two golden kiwi fruits daily can reduce triglycerides but has no effect on cholesterol levels (57498, 57581). The mechanism of kiwi's lipid-lowering effects is unknown.\nSkin effects\nIn vitro research shows that polysaccharides from kiwi fruit can increase the proliferation of human keratinocytes and the proliferation and synthesis of fibroblasts. The cell growth-stimulating effect of polysaccharides from kiwi fruit were attributed to terminal 1-alpha-l-arabinose residues (57499)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of kohlrabi are the above ground parts. Kohlrabi contains fiber, protein, glucosinolates, carotenoids (including beta-carotene and lutein), anthocyanins, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin A (6790, 90486, 90488). Some of the other constituents include sulfur (26474) and dithiolethiones (26475).\nAnticancer effects\nEvidence from epidemiological research suggests that vegetables of the Brassica oleracea species have protective effects against some types of cancer (14145). These vegetables contain about 10 different kinds of glucosinolates (6790). These glucosinolates are usually accompanied by myrosinase, a thioglucosidase enzyme found in plant cells in separate compartments (6792). When the plant cells are damaged by cutting or chewing, the myrosinase is exposed to glucosinolates, catalyzing its hydrolysis to a range of breakdown products, such as indoles, nitriles, and isothiocyanates (ITCs).\n\nITCs are sulfur-containing phytochemicals present in the form of sulforaphane (SFN), phenylethylisothiocyanate, benzylisothiocyanate, and 3-phenylpropylisothiocyanate. These chemicals are thought to be anticarcinogenic due to their effects on phase I and phase II enzymes (10264, 26449, 26483, 47627, 55547). Phase I and phase II enzymes act as the body's first line of defense against cancer by protecting the body from carcinogens that routinely enter the body through the diet and the environment. ITCs generally enhance the activity of phase II enzymes and inhibit phase I enzymes, thus reducing the production of electrophilic intermediates with carcinogenic activity and enhancing the detoxification and clearance of carcinogens. ITCs also act as suppressing agents during the promotion phase of the neoplastic process and induce apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cell growth (26449, 26485).\n\nIndoles include indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) (47627). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C inhibits carcinogenesis by inducing enzymes such as cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases (GST), or epoxide hydrolases (EH). These enzymes metabolize carcinogens to more polar and excretable forms (26489, 26491, 47596). Evidence from animal research has shown that indoles and isothiocyanates attenuate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines and are protective towards heterocyclic amines (51183). The effects on PAH and nitrosamines appear to be via induction of GST and inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, respectively.\n\nIndoles and phytoestrogens found in Brassica species may also contribute to the protection of hormone-dependent breast and cervical cancers. Evidence from animal research suggests that I3C inhibits mammary cancers (26469) and that its use may inhibit breast and cervical cancers in women (47627). In women, I3C increases the 2-hydroxylation of estrogen urinary metabolites (47615). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C suppresses the proliferation of various tumor cells, including breast, prostate, endometrial, colon, and leukemic cells (47627).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that ascorbigen, a constituent of Brassica vegetables formed by indole-3-carbinole and ascorbic acid, is a less potent antioxidant than ascorbic acid. However, ascorbigen appears to prevent tert-butyl hydroperoxide cytotoxicity in vitro (26497)."

Kombucha also contains various yeasts such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and other yeasts in the Zygosaccharomyces genus (103179, 110638). Kombucha is prepared by mixing the SCOBY with tea, sugar, and sourdough from a previous fermentation, then allowing to ferment at room temperature for 7-14 days (103179). The content of kombucha depends on the type of tea used (black, green, red, or white), and the fermentation conditions and time. It typically contains organic acids including acetic acid (vinegar), ethanol, minerals (potassium, manganese, fluoride), vitamins (B, E, K), amino acids (especially theanine), and polyphenols including flavonoids (2653, 2655, 103179, 115162, 115181). The acetic acid content increases with the duration of fermentation. Other organic acids present include glucuronic, gluconic, tartaric, malic, citric, lactic, butyric, formic, succinic, and malonic acids (103179, 109593, 109596, 115162). The amount of catechins and caffeine in kombucha varies across products, with one analysis of nine kombucha products showing caffeine content ranging from 3 mg to 27 mg per 8-ounce-serving (109595). Depending on the type of tea used, the ethanol content increases up to 3% to 3.5% by day 7 of fermentation and then decreases to 2% to 3% by day 14 (103179). An analysis of commercially available kombucha products in Canada found that ethanol content ranged from 0% to 3.6%, with a mean of 0.6% (109594).\n\nKombucha has the potential to incubate organisms that can cause opportunistic infections, including Aspergillus and anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), during its preparation (2651, 2652, 2653, 103179). Due to the vinegar and ethanol content, it also has the potential to leach lead and other toxic chemicals from the walls of the preparation and storage containers (2650).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that kombucha has anti-inflammatory effects. In a mouse model of sepsis, kombucha decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Researchers theorize that these effects are due to the promotion of butyrate-producing bacterial growth in the gut (109593).\nAntiaging effects\nIn animal research, kombucha increased life span (57726). The mechanism of kombucha's antiaging effects is unclear.\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that kombucha has antidiabetic effects. In one rat model of diabetes, kombucha inhibited alpha-amylase and reduced levels of blood glucose (57756). In multiple mouse models of diabetes, kombucha reduced blood glucose levels, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose-induced insulin secretion while, improving measures of insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance (109596, 110637). In human research, kombucha modestly reduces the glycemic and insulin responses to a meal (115179). Researchers have theorized that, by increasing levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in the gut, kombucha promotes secretion of the gastrointestinal hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and recombinant peptide YY (PYY), which thereby improve pancreatic beta-cell function (109596).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that kombucha has antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacter pylori, and Listeria monocytogenes, by a mechanism that includes, but is not limited to, lactic acid production (57723, 57746).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn laboratory research, kombucha had antiproliferative effects against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines (57746).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome animal research shows that kombucha has antioxidant effects, resulting in decreased lipid peroxidation and damage to DNA, reduced plasma malondialdehyde levels, and increased glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity (57724, 57731, 57735, 57749). The antioxidant potential of kombucha is highest when prepared from green tea and lowest with black tea. Intermediate levels are seen with red and white tea. The antioxidant activity also seems to increase during the first 7 days of fermentation, after which point it decreases (103179).\nAntiulcer effects\nSome animal research suggests that kombucha has antiulcer effects. Kombucha healed indomethacin-associated gastric ulceration better than black tea and black tea fermented with Candida parapsilosis (57754). Possible mechanisms of action include antioxidant effects, protection of gastric mucin levels, and reduced gastric acid secretion. However, depending on the preparation conditions and fermentation time, kombucha can contain significant amounts of organic acids which could exacerbate gastric ulcers (103179).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn various animal models, kombucha has hepatoprotective effects (57731, 57747, 57752, 57755, 57756, 110637). Kombucha's antioxidant properties may explain its hepatoprotective effects (57752, 57755). A study in mice fed a high fat diet found that kombucha reduced the accumulation of hepatocyte fat, collagen deposition in the liver's perivascular spaces, and hepatic FXR gene expression when compared to water. This suggests that kombucha may offset nonalcoholic fatty liver disease related to obesity (110637).\nHypolipidemic effects\nSome animal research suggests that kombucha delays absorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (57756).\nImmune effects\nKombucha may stimulate the immune system (57730). In one animal study, kombucha reduced the immunosuppression associated with lead feeding (57730, 57735). In another animal study, kombucha increased humoral and delayed-type hypersensitivity response and improved responses in chromate-treated animals (57724).\nIntestinal effects\nAlthough some research disagrees (115186), most research in humans and animal models suggests that kombucha modulates the gut microbiota (110638, 115181, 115184). Some human research suggests that kombucha does not affect intestinal permeability or levels of short chain fatty acids (115181, 115186). Researchers have hypothesized that improved intestinal health may be attributed to the high content and diversity of phenolic compounds found in kombucha (110638).\nWeight effects\nSome animal research suggests that use of kombucha might decrease body weight and dietary intake of food and beverages (57726, 57760)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Korean pine.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Korean pine are the nut, bark, needle, and tree resin. Korean pine nut oil contains polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily trienoic and pinolenic acids (97259). It also contains palmitic acid, podocarpic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid (27089, 27096, 27108, 110679). Oleoresin from Korean pine contains alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, undecane, bornyl-acetate, sesquiterpenes including longifolene and koraiol, and diterpenes (27080, 27104). Korean pine bark extract contains procyanidins (27086). Essential oil from the needles contains alpha-terpineol, linalool, limonene, anethole, caryophyllene, eugenol, trans-communol, 13-epi-torulosol, serratane triterpenoids, beta-sitosterol, and trans-communic, neoabietic, dehydroabietic, abietic, levopimaric, and palustric acids (110680). Essential oil from the cones contains limonene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 3-carene, beta-myrcene, isolongifolene, bornyl acetate, caryophyllene, and camphene (110680).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPotential anti-inflammatory effects of Korean pine nut oil may be related to its fatty acid constituents. In vitro evidence suggests that exposing macrophage cells to pinolenic acid, a fatty acid in Korean pine nut oil, suppresses the synthesis of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) from dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid (27112). In brown Norway rats immunized with intraperitoneal ovalbumin, a 10% Korean pine nut oil diet increases leukotriene (LT) B4 production compared to a diet based on safflower oil (27090).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that Korean pine essential oil has antifungal effects, particularly against Candida glabrata and Cryptococcus neoformans (27103, 27105).\nAntitumor effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that Korean pine extract containing procyanidins can reduce the weight of tumors generated from cervical cancer cells, possibly by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing the expression of Ki-67, mutant p53, and Bcl-2 genes (27086).\nAppetite-suppressant effects\nClinical research shows that a specific Korean pine nut oil product (PinnoThin, Lipid Nutrition) suppresses the appetite by increasing satiety hormones cholecystokinin (CCK-8), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY, thereby reducing food intake (27091, 27092, 27093).\nBody fat effects\nIn mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, addition of Korean pine nut oil reduces white adipose tissue accumulation and weight gain, when compared with adding soybean oil. Korean pine nut oil increases expression of ghrelin receptors and agouti-related peptide, which increase appetite, but also increases levels of appetite-suppressing neuropeptides. Korean pine nut oil seems to suppress intestinal fatty acid absorption, downregulates fatty acid uptake by adipocytes, upregulates lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipocytes, decreases chylomicron synthesis, and increases fecal non-esterified fatty acid excretion (110679).\nCutaneous effects\nPreliminary research in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis shows that applying butylene glycol extracts of Korean pine needles and cones to the skin, and giving aqueous extracts orally for 5 weeks reduces erythema, edema, excoriation, itching, and lichenification. In the skin, the extracts reduced mast cell numbers, immune cell infiltration, abnormal cell shapes, and levels of immunoglobulin E, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-4, interferon-gamma, and lipid peroxides (110680).\nHypotensive effects\nAnimal research shows that pinolenic acid, a constituent of Korean pine nut oil, reduces blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats fed high-fat diets (27096). In people with normal blood pressure, taking an extract of Korean pine needles orally, 600 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure by about 5 mmHg but does not affect diastolic blood pressure (97259).\nImmunological effects\nIn brown Norway rats immunized with intraperitoneal ovalbumin, a diet consisting of 10% Korean pine nut oil does not affect CD8+ T-lymphocyte population, but leukotriene B4 production and splenic production of IgG and IgE are increased compared to diets containing safflower oil or evening primrose oil (27090).\nLipid-lowering effects\nIn vitro research shows that treating a particular liver cancer cell line with a high pinolenic acid-containing extract of Korean pine nut increases the internalization of 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) compared to extracts containing low levels of pinolenic acid. Theoretically, Korean pine nut oil with higher amounts of pinolenic acid may help lower LDL levels by enhancing hepatic uptake (27089). However, animal research shows that Korean pine nut oil does not significantly improve serum levels of cholesterol or triglycerides (27096, 27097), although a small but significant decrease in liver apolipoprotein C3 (apoC-III) has been observed (27097). In people with mild dyslipidemia (total cholesterol 200-239 mg/dL), taking an extract of Korean pine needles orally, 600 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not have a significant effect on any serum lipid levels (97259)."

    "Kratom": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Kratom is a tree native to Southeast Asia (27130, 104635). Traditionally, the leaves were chewed or brewed in a tea, but kratom is now available in many formulations, including powders, capsules, tablets, liquids, gums, and resins (104634, 113075, 113067). The bioactive constituents of kratom are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Mitragynine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is the most abundant bioactive alkaloid in kratom, while 7-hydroxymitragynine is a mu-opioid agonist that is estimated to be approximately 10-13 times as potent as morphine (101704, 103219, 113065).",
            "Warnings": "The tree and leaves of kratom are illegal or restricted in some countries and states, although it is possible to obtain kratom preparations over the internet (90818, 90819, 104635). In 2016 the DEA considered placing the kratom constituents mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. However, after this was met by strong opposition from kratom support groups and some members of Congress, the DEA withdrew its intent to schedule kratom (95799).\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned consumers on multiple occasions that kratom use has been linked to serious adverse effects including respiratory depression, aggression, hallucinations, delusions, vomiting, seizures, liver damage, severe withdrawal, and death (21025, 94896, 95803). Furthermore, a salmonella outbreak from kratom products in pills, powders, and teas was reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018. At least 199 people spanning more than 41 states were affected, and 54 patients were hospitalized (95805, 113078). Kratom samples tested by the FDA found that 33 out of 66 (50%) samples contained one or more serotypes of salmonella associated with illness, suggesting widespread contamination. The FDA and state regulatory agencies issued 13 recalls from March to June 2018 for 67 kratom products from 26 distributors due to the risk of salmonella infection (113078).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Short-term use of kratom, especially in combination with other substances, has been associated with cases of intrahepatic cholestasis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, encephalopathy syndrome, and death (27133, 95797, 95798, 99182, 103216, 104634, 104637, 108758, 108760, 108763)(108764, 108765, 113069). Long-term use of kratom has been associated with tolerance and withdrawal symptoms including abdominal pain, acute mania, aggression, agitation, anxiety, diarrhea, difficulty concentrating, dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, muscle aches and spasms, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, shakiness, and tremors (27115, 27125, 27130, 104637, 108757, 113061, 113067, 113079, 113080, 115446)(115449, 115933).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about safety of kratom when applied topically.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. There have been multiple case reports of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the infants of those who used kratom during pregnancy (100503, 100504). Animal research suggests that kratom crosses the placenta (100506).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, kratom is possibly unsafe. Topically, no adverse effects have been reported; however, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Constipation, dependence (chronic use), dry mouth, frequent urination, nausea, tongue numbness, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Cardiac arrest, death, encephalopathy syndrome, hallucinations, hypertension, hypothyroidism, insomnia, liver damage, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory depression, seizures, serotonin syndrome, and tachycardia. However, a definite causal link between kratom and most of these serious adverse effects has not yet been confirmed.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, kratom can cause tachycardia and changes in blood pressure, especially when used in doses of 8 grams or more (95819). In one Poison Control Center report of 3484 exposures to kratom, the majority of which involved oral single-substance exposures, 45% of cases reported cardiovascular effects (108565). Patients who have called poison control centers in the United States, Thailand, and British Columbia report stimulant effects including tachycardia and hypertension after chronic and acute kratom use (95796, 95797, 95798, 95818, 101707, 104633, 104636, 104637, 113075).\n\nAdditionally, a large analysis of adverse effect reporting databases suggests that mitragynine, a constituent of kratom, is associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, but not QTc prolongation. The validity of this study is limited by voluntary reports and potential for multiple co-ingestions or co-exposures in individual reports (114575).\n\nOne observational study reported that regular kratom use, with an estimated daily intake of mitragynine 7.06 mg/kg/day, was associated with at least an 8-fold increase in the odds of presenting with sinus tachycardia when compared with non-kratom users. However, there was no difference in the odds of having other ECG abnormalities (104636). In this study, kratom use was associated with an increased odds of borderline QTc intervals, but not prolonged QTc intervals. The highest odds occurred in those who started using kratom after age 18, had used kratom for more than 6 years, or those who had used kratom within 3 hours of the ECG (104636). In regular kratom users, a case series conducted to analyze serum mitragynine levels with respect to cardiovascular functioning found that higher serum mitragynine levels (i.e., at least 9.6 mg/L) were associated with prolongation of the QT interval and such effects were found to be dose-dependent (108566).\n\nIn one case report, an otherwise healthy, 35-year-old male with a history of opioid use disorder presented with cardiac arrest after recently consuming kratom tea multiple times per day. No other substance use was identified on toxicology screening or via patient report (101706).\n\nAnother case of cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation has been reported in a 24-year-old male who reported long-term use of kratom (dose and frequency unknown). While the patient had a history of polysubstance abuse, his serum and urine drug screens were negative for opiates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and cocaine (103215). Similarly, cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation was reported in an 18-year-old male during football training following the consumption of 2 grams of kratom and an energy drink. Blood tests were positive for kratom and caffeine. It is unclear if the cardiac event was related to kratom, caffeine, exercise, or other factors (115452). A 32-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, depression, and obesity presented after collapsing due to seizure with acute mitragynine intoxication. The patient also presented with cardiomegaly with left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatomegaly, cerebral edema, and pulmonary edema. Postmortem toxicology analysis of blood, organs, and gastric contents were negative for all illicit and prescription drugs except for the kratom components mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (113069).\n\nThere have been two case reports of 54-year-old adults using kratom regularly for one year who developed stimulatory effects and a large hemorrhagic stroke. In both cases, the development of these adverse effects occurred immediately after the transition to a different kratom product (101705, 108759). In one case, the product was found to be adulterated with phenethylamine (PEA), an amphetamine-like chemical, which was considered the likely cause of these effects (101705).\nless\nDermatologic\nA case of photodistributed hyperpigmentation on the arms and face has been reported in a 54-year-old male who regularly consumed powdered kratom in orange juice 3-4 times daily for up to 5 years (113073). Another case of progressive, drug-induced photodistributed hyperpigmentation on the neck, chest, arms, and legs was reported in a 56-year-old female who took 4-5 doses of kratom daily for 7 years (113064).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case of primary hypothyroidism has been reported for an individual who regularly consumed kratom (27132). However, a causal link between kratom use and thyroid dysfunction has not yet been determined.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nKratom ingestion has been associated with nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, tongue numbness, increased appetite, and constipation (27130, 27136, 95797, 95818, 104637, 113067, 113080, 115451). In one Poison Control Center report of 3484 exposures to kratom, the majority of which involved oral single-substance exposures, 25% of cases reported gastrointestinal effects (108565). Observational research, data from the British Columbia poison control center, and a report from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System have found that habitual intake of kratom is associated with withdrawal symptoms, including decreased appetite and diarrhea (27115, 113067, 113075).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, kratom has been associated with cases of liver damage. Between 2003 and 2019, there were 11 cases of liver injury reported in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) with definite, highly likely, or probable causality attributed to kratom. Of these cases, 8 were reported between 2017 and 2019. The median time from kratom use to the onset of symptoms was 14 days. Just over half of the patients had evidence of mixed liver injury, including both hepatocellular and cholestatic injury (104634). In addition, published case reports, the FDA adverse event databases, DILIN, and the British Columbia poison control center identified 72 reports of kratom-induced liver injury, although it's possible some duplication of reporting occurred across the databases (103216, 113075).\n\nMultiple detailed case reports of liver injury have been published (27133, 95798, 101703, 108761, 108764, 113075, 113076, 113084). One case of intrahepatic cholestasis has been reported for a 25-year-old healthy male who consumed kratom powder, starting at 1-2 teaspoons (2.3-7 grams) daily and increasing to 4-6 teaspoons (9-21 grams) daily over 2 weeks (27133). In another case report, a 40-year-old female presented with symptoms of mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular liver injury after consuming kratom once weekly for the past month. Her symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of kratom (101703). Cases of transaminitis, with or without bilirubin elevation, also have been described (95798, 108761, 113084, 113080, 113085). In one such case, a 60-year-old patient presented with elevated transaminases and bilirubin after ingesting kratom one teaspoon three times daily for one month. The liver enzymes normalized after discontinuing kratom and receiving supportive treatment with N-acetylcysteine (95798). In another case, a patient with a several-year history of kratom use and a history of hepatic steatosis, choledocholithiasis, and cholecystectomy presented with worsening jaundice, scleral icterus, ascites, and pitting edema. The patient was found to have cholestatic hepatitis consistent with drug-induced liver injury, as well as steatohepatitis with marked fibrosis and scarring (108764). A third case also reported a mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular liver injury in a 23-year-old male who had consumed a cocktail containing kratom leaves, caffeinated soda, and diphenhydramine syrup daily for 2 weeks. Liver function tests normalized after supportive care and discontinuation of the kratom-containing product (113084). In one case of chronic kratom abuse, an adult presented with acute liver failure with hyperbilirubinemia and acute kidney injury. The patient recovered after plasma exchange treatment daily for 4 days in addition to supportive care (114574).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nObservational research has found that habitual intake of kratom is associated with withdrawal symptoms, including arthralgias, lower extremity hyperreflexia, muscle pain, rigidity, spasms, and tremors (27115, 27130, 104637, 113061, 113080).\n\nIn a case report, a 45-year-old adult who had used kratom intermittently for 10 months experienced mild rhabdomyolysis and generalized seizures (95798). Several cases of severe rhabdomyolysis and associated kidney injury necessitating hemodialysis have been described (108763, 108765).\n\nIn another case report, a 39-year-old adult experienced transient paralysis, with full awareness but an inability to move or speak, within 1 hour of using kratom. The patient reported a recent history of kratom use over the past few months, but that the paralysis occurred immediately after the use of a different kratom product (108767).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIn one Poison Control Center report of 3484 exposures to kratom, the majority of which involved oral single-substance exposures, 75% of cases reported neurologic effects, including agitation, coma, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, hallucinations, seizures, and tremor (108565). Other reports of calls to poison control centers related to kratom use and data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System show that 5% to 25% of cases included reports of seizures, coma, headache, or confusion (95798, 101707, 104637, 113071).\n\nMultiple cases of kratom-induced new-onset or recurrent generalized tonic-clonic seizures have been reported in regular users of kratom (103214, 108760, 113069). One case series describes two patients with prior epilepsy who developed breakthrough seizures associated with kratom use and one patient who developed a diagnosis of epilepsy after continued use of kratom. Seizures generally occurred within 1 month of initiation of kratom and ceased with discontinuation of kratom and continuation of an effective antiepileptic drug regimen (108758).\n\nMost case reports of seizure often involve use of multiple active agents, including diphenhydramine, methamphetamine, and other medications not normally associated with seizures (108760). A case of seizure and coma has been reported for a 64-year-old habitual kratom user who had ingested a tea containing an undetermined quantity of kratom and jimson weed 30 minutes prior to the event. This patient had also been taking amitriptyline and oxycodone chronically, although neither of these drugs is typically associated with increased seizure risk (27131). Additionally, a case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures has been reported for a 43-year-old male patient who added modafinil 100 mg to his chronic ingestion of kratom tea four times daily as self-treatment for opioid withdrawal. Modafinil is not generally associated with increased seizures; however, it is speculated that the combination of modafinil with kratom may have contributed to the adverse event (27127). Finally, there is a case report of a 22-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with severe headache, confusion, hypertension, and visual disturbances due to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) after taking an undisclosed amount of dextroamphetamine and kratom. It is believed that the combination with kratom resulted in increased blood pressure and neurotoxicity that caused PRES (95797).\n\nOrally, kratom has been linked to respiratory depression, particularly when used in combination with other mu-opioid agonists (27119, 27120, 27136, 104637, 113075, 114755). In reviews of kratom-associated adverse events reported to the National Poison Data System, up to 12% of cases experienced respiratory effects, including respiratory depression (101707, 104637, 108565). There were 9 reports of deaths most likely due to respiratory depression in patients who ingested a combination product (Krypton) containing kratom and O-desmethyltramadol, another mu-receptor agonist (27119, 27120). Serum concentrations of O-desmethyltramadol ranged from 0.4 to 4.3 mcg/gram. Tramadol concentrations >1 mcg/gram are considered toxic, and O-desmethyltramadol is considered to be a more potent metabolite of tramadol. Therefore, it is believed that O-desmethyltramadol probably contributed to the toxicity, but kratom possibly had an additive effect. Nearly all of these patients had brain edema and lung edema or congestion and some also had liver steatosis during autopsy. Many of these patients had a history of drug abuse and also had detectable serum concentrations of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, alcohol, amphetamines, zopiclone, alimemazine, or other drugs (27120).\n\nKratom was implicated in a case of serotonin syndrome in a patient taking multiple serotonergic prescription medications. In the case report, a 63-year-old male was stable for 2 years on bupropion, buspirone, desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone when he started taking kratom 3 times daily for 3 months. The patient presented with aphasia, spontaneous clonus, confusion, diaphoresis, dysarthria, facial droop, fever, flushing, hyperreflexia, and tremors with elevated creatine phosphokinase and lactic acid. Symptoms improved after discontinuing kratom and supportive care with cyproheptadine, lorazepam, intravenous fluids, and cooling blankets (113059).\n\nObservational research has found that habitual intake of kratom is associated with withdrawal symptoms, including hot flashes and fever (27115).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn patients who habitually ingest kratom, withdrawal symptoms include watery eyes (27115). Additionally, there are multiple case reports of ocular clonus resulting from taking high doses of kratom that users referred to as \"the wobbles\" (113080).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, kratom has been associated with aggression, agitation, altered mental status, anxiety, delusions, depression, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, paranoia, restlessness, sedation, and suicidal ideation, in case reports and case series (27136, 95798, 113067, 113071, 113079, 113080, 114755, 115445). In a review of kratom-associated adverse events reported to the National Poison Data System, 18.6% of users reported agitation, 13.6% reported drowsiness, 8.1% reported confusion, and 4.8% reported hallucinations (101707). In an analysis of kratom abuse cases in Thailand and the United States from 2010-2017, agitation/irritability, drowsiness/lethargy, confusion, and hallucinations were reported in approximately 26%, 21%, 16%, and 7%, respectively (104637). Additionally, data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004 to 2021 shows that kratom use was linked to dependence, anxiety, withdrawal syndrome, and drug abuse in 11%, 6%, 5%, and 5% of total adverse events reported (113067).\n\nA cross-sectional study in approximately 400 adults with regular kratom use suggests that kratom dose and frequency of use are positively associated with symptoms of kratom use disorder and withdrawal (115446). Additionally, multiple case reports of patients who habitually ingest kratom at high doses report physical tolerance, dependence, and subsequent withdrawal upon discontinuation that is consistent with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for kratom use disorder. Some cases of dependence and/or withdrawal have been successfully treated with buprenorphine/naloxone (108757, 108766, 113061, 113079, 113080, 114754, 115446, 115449, 115933). One case of acute withdrawal symptoms was managed with intravenous lorazepam and dexmedetomidine (114754). Additionally, in a case of acute mania due to kratom withdrawal, aripiprazole was used to manage symptoms (115933).\n\nThere have been multiple case reports of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurring in the infants of patients who used kratom throughout pregnancy. Daily kratom doses in these cases ranged from 15-60 grams daily; self-directed attempts to discontinue use during pregnancy failed due to symptoms of withdrawal. The affected infants were successfully treated with standard NAS monitoring and care (100503, 100504). The absence of kratom identification by standard urine toxicology tests can make detection of kratom use challenging (100504, 100505). However, specialized umbilical cord testing can identify kratom analytes mitragynine and speciociliatine as biomarkers for in-utero kratom exposure (113062). In some patients, prenatal screening with questionnaires specifically inquiring about kratom use has led to early detection and successful transition to buprenorphine for the remainder of the pregnancy (100505).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, kratom has been linked to respiratory depression, particularly when used in combination with other mu-opioid agonists (27119, 27120, 27136, 104637, 108565, 113071, 114755). In one case report, a 36-year-old male with a history of substance abuse and smoking was diagnosed with kratom-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after presenting with progressive respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and bilateral lung infiltrates. The patient was treated with mechanical ventilation, intravenous methylprednisolone, and supplemental oxygen (113057). Additionally, a 32-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, depression, and obesity presented after collapsing due to seizure with acute mitragynine intoxication. The patient was found to have pulmonary edema along with cardiomegaly with left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatomegaly, and cerebral edema. Postmortem toxicology analysis of blood, organs, and gastric contents were negative for all illicit and prescription drugs except for the kratom components mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (113069).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, kratom has been associated with frequent urination, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal insufficiency, (27130, 27136, 95797, 108762, 113066, 113068). In one case report, a 61-year-old male with no significant past medical history experienced persistent asymptomatic hyperkalemia after 4 months of regular, nearly daily use of kratom. Potassium levels normalized upon discontinuation of kratom (108762). In another case, a 62-year-old male with severe hyponatremia presented with altered mental status, restlessness, and minimal fluid intake after consuming large doses of kratom. The hyponatremia was treated with fluids and discontinuation of kratom (113068).\n\nIn another case report, a 21-year-old female was diagnosed with acute renal insufficiency after presenting with nausea, vomiting, left flank pain, elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and bilateral enlarged kidneys after consuming kratom tea. Testing of the kratom leaf sample revealed the presence of hydrocodone, morphine, and mitragynine which all contributed to acute renal insufficiency. The symptoms resolved following discontinuation of the kratom product and supportive care with intravenous fluids. It is unclear whether the renal insufficiency was due to kratom or the other adulterants in the tested sample (113066).\nless\nOther\nData from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System shows that from 2004 to 2021, out of 489 kratom-related adverse reaction reports, 102 deaths and 34 accidental deaths were reported, accounting for 21% and 7% of total adverse events reported. However, only 45% of reported adverse events listed kratom as the only drug ingested (113067). In February 2018, the FDA reported at least 44 deaths associated with kratom use. This number was based on information from academic research, poison control centers, medical examiner reports, social science research, and adverse event reports. The exact cause of death was not determined in most cases (95804). More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) to determine what percentage of kratom-positive deaths reported between July 2016 and December 2017 were caused by kratom. Of 27,338 overdose deaths reported, 152 of the decedents tested positive for kratom in a postmortem analysis. Of these cases in which the decedents were kratom-positive, 91 of the deaths were considered to be kratom-involved (99182). In one Poison Control Center report of 3484 exposures to kratom, the majority of which involved oral single-substance exposures, 8 deaths occurred in cases where kratom was the only substance involved (108565). Adverse effects prior to kratom-related death have included pulmonary edema and congestion, pulmonary embolism, encephalopathy, cardiorespiratory arrest, cardiomegaly, hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures (95804, 113069).\n\nIn almost all cases, kratom was used along with other drugs, so it is unclear if kratom was the primary causal agent or a contributing factor (95804, 99182, 99811, 103217, 113067). Furthermore, in an analysis of deaths attributed to kratom in Colorado, re-testing of residual blood from decedents found that all cases of kratom-related death involved other drugs, including those that were initially reported as not involving other drugs (99811). Concomitant drugs included fentanyl, benzodiazepines, opioids, stimulants, antidepressants, antihistamines, antitussives, sedatives, antihypertensives, antidiarrheals, anticonvulsants, and other medications (95804, 99182, 99811). Additionally, samples of commercially available kratom products may contain high levels of lead which pose significant health risks to consumers, especially at high doses. There is significant overlap in adverse effects in the central nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system between kratom and lead toxicity, which raises the possibility that toxic effects attributed to kratom may actually be due to lead contaminants in kratom products (113074).\n\nLong-term, heavy kratom intake does not appear to be associated with abnormalities in standard hematological and clinical chemistry blood tests (98450, 98451).\nless",

Data from a sample of 28 kratom products obtained by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests the presence of lead at levels of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg per gram of kratom, which could exceed the FDA's provisional tolerant total daily intake and far exceeds lead levels found in various common foods (113074).",

Although results from animal research suggest that mitragynine causes less respiratory depression than the CNS depressant codeine (27130), fatalities have been reported for patients who ingested a combination of kratom and O-desmethyltramadol, another mu-receptor agonist (27119, 27120). Additionally, observational research suggests that adverse effects such as drowsiness and coma are more likely to occur in individuals taking kratom in combination with agents such as opioids and sedatives (104637). Theoretically, ingesting kratom along with other CNS depressants can increase the risk of adverse effects, including drowsiness, coma, and/or severe or fatal respiratory depression.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, kratom might increase the levels and clinical effects of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.\nIn vitro research suggests that kratom extract inhibits the activity of CYP1A2 (27134). In one case report, a 63-year-old male presented with possible serotonin syndrome after taking an unknown dose of kratom for up to 3 months along with serotonergic prescription medications bupropion, buspirone, desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone. It was hypothesized that kratom inhibited CYP1A2-mediaed metabolism of ziprasidone which consequently increased systemic exposure to serotonin (113059).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, kratom might increase the levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\nIn vitro research shows that kratom extract weakly inhibits CYP2C19 enzyme activity (27134).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, kratom might increase the levels and clinical effects of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.\nIn vitro research suggests that kratom extract inhibits CYP2D6 enzyme activity (27134). However, human research shows that a single low dose of kratom tea 2 grams does not inhibit CYP2D6 activity. However, this kratom dose is lower than what is normally taken for psychoactive effects (113083). In one case report, a 63-year-old male presented with possible serotonin syndrome after taking an unknown dose of kratom for up to 3 months along with serotonergic prescription medications bupropion, buspirone, desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone. It was hypothesized that kratom inhibited CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of buspirone and consequently increased systemic exposure to serotonin (113059). In another case, a 37-year-old male stable for 15 years on amitriptyline presented with anticholinergic symptoms including xerostomia, dry eyes, and constipation, along with mildly elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes after taking progressively higher doses of up to 14 grams of kratom daily for 12 weeks. It was hypothesized that the adverse effects of amitriptyline were precipitated by CYP2D6 inhibition by kratom (113085).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) INHIBITORS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCYP3A4 inhibitors might increase the concentrations and clinical effects of kratom's primary active alkaloid mitragynine.\nA pharmacokinetic study in healthy adults suggests that CYP3A4 inhibition with itraconazole increases the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of mitragynine by about 1.5-fold. However, CYP3A4 inhibition reduces the Cmax and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) over 72 hours of 7-hydroxymitragynine, one of kratom's active constituents, by about 3-fold, possibly by decreasing the metabolism of mitragynine to 7-hydroxymitragynin (115451).\n\nAnimal research suggests that CYP3A4 inhibition with ketoconazole reduces the metabolism and clearance of kratom, increasing the Cmax of the active metabolite mitragynine by 130%, time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) from 1 to 2.6 hours, and AUC by 120%. Additionally, CYP3A4-mediated conversion of mitragynine into 7-hydroxymitragynine increases systematic exposure by 130%. However, other CYP isoforms are likely involved in this conversion. CYP3A4 inhibition could lead to increased adverse effects and mu-opioid-receptor-mediated behavioral effects associated with kratom and its metabolites (113065).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nKratom might increase the levels and clinical effects of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nIn vitro research shows that kratom extract inhibits CYP3A4 enzyme activity (27134). A pharmacokinetic study in adults shows that taking kratom tea 2 grams modestly increases the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of CYP3A4 probe midazolam by 40-50% and its CYP3A4-mediated metabolites 18-27%. However, a lack of change in the half-life of midazolam and a simulation of the kratom-midazolam interaction suggest that kratom inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes in the small intestine but not the liver (113083). Additionally, there is one case report of a 27-year-old male who died from neuroleptic malignant-like symptoms after concomitant use of kratom and quetiapine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although it did not appear that the patient had consumed large quantities of quetiapine, postmortem plasma levels were in the lethal range, indicating possible inhibition of CYP3A4 by kratom (99810). In another case report, a 63-year-old male presented with possible serotonin syndrome after taking an unknown dose of kratom for up to 3 months along with serotonergic prescription medications bupropion, buspirone, desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone. It is hypothesized that CYP3A4 inhibition by kratom reduced metabolism of desvenlafaxine, trazodone, and ziprasidone and consequently increased systemic exposure to serotonin (113059).\nless\nMODAFINIL (Provigil)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, taking kratom in combination with modafinil may increase the risk of seizures.\nA 43-year-old male patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures after adding modafinil 100 mg to his chronic ingestion of kratom tea four times daily to further improve alertness and as a self-treatment for opioid withdrawal (27127). The exact mechanism by which this interaction may occur is unknown.\nless\nNALTREXONE (Vivitrol)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTaking kratom in combination with naltrexone might precipitate withdrawal.\nAnimal research shows that, while naltrexone does not antagonize the primary kratom alkaloid mitragynine, it does inhibit the behavioral effects of the metabolite 7-hyroxymitragynine by antagonizing its binding at the mu-opioid receptor (113070). In humans, taking naltrexone has precipitated withdrawal from kratom. In one case, a patient chronically consuming kratom developed agitation, hallucinations, and delirium within about 2 hours of beginning oral naltrexone therapy (114754). In another case, a 38-year-old male who was admitted to a residential rehabilitation treatment program for polysubstance abuse experienced opioid withdrawal after administration of intramuscular naltrexone. Although the patient reported discontinuing kratom, continued use was confirmed through positive urine mitragynine tests. Manufacturer guidance states that patients should be opioid-free for a minimum of 7-10 days prior to initiating treatment with naltrexone; this case report suggests that kratom use should be given similar consideration (108761).\nless\nQUETIAPINE (Seroquel)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, taking kratom in combination with quetiapine may increase levels and adverse effects of quetiapine.\nA 27-year-old male was found deceased due to neuroleptic malignant-like symptoms after concomitant consumption of quetiapine and kratom. Although it did not appear that he had consumed large quantities of the medication, he was found to have a lethal plasma level of quetiapine (99810). It is hypothesized that kratom inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, the primary metabolic pathway for quetiapine (99810). Also, a 36-year-old male presented to the emergency department with serotonin syndrome and QT interval prolongation after concomitant use of quetiapine, venlafaxine, and kratom.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nMost cases of kratom overdose present with altered states of consciousness and include signs and symptoms of opioid syndrome, sympathetic overactivation, and serotonin-like syndrome. Opioid syndrome may present as depressed consciousness, coma, bradypnea, miosis, or vomiting. However, kratom is not detected via routine opioid urine drug screens (114574, 114755). Analyses of fingernail clippings and hair samples from users of kratom have detected mitragynine and other bioactive alkaloids (115447, 115450). Sympathetic overactivation may appear as hypertension, tachycardia, and mydriasis (113069, 113075, 113080, 114755). Signs and symptoms of excess serotonergic excess include agitation, restlessness, confusion, diaphoresis, myoclonus, and vomiting. These syndromes of kratom overdose may manifest differently depending on the patient's medical history, kratom tolerance and dose, and concomitant substances ingested (113069, 113075, 113080, 114755).\n\nDeaths have occurred in individuals using kratom (95804, 99182, 113067, 113069, 114576, 114577). In one case, a patient was asystolic after collapsing due to seizure with acute mitragynine intoxication. The patient was also found to have cardiomegaly with left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatomegaly, cerebral edema, and pulmonary edema. Postmortem toxicology analysis of blood, organs, and gastric contents were negative for all illicit and prescription drugs except for the kratom components mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (113069).\n\nHowever, in most cases kratom was used along with other drugs, so it is unclear if kratom was the primary causal agent or a contributing factor (95804, 99182, 99811, 103217, 104637, 114576, 114577). Concomitant drugs have included acetaminophen, alcohol, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, marijuana, opioids, stimulants, antidepressants, antihistamines, antitussives, sedatives, antihypertensives, antidiarrheals, anticonvulsants, MDMA, 3-fluorophenmetrazine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, L-tyrosine, phenibut, maca root, and other medications (95804, 99182, 99811, 104637, 113071, 113075, 114576, 114577).\n\nThere have also been cases of non-fatal overdose with kratom alone. In at least two cases, patients presented after loss of consciousness with reversible nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe rhabdomyolysis with associated kidney injury, with or without compartment syndrome or cerebrovascular accident (108763, 108765). Additionally, in at least one case without other contributing drugs, an adult presented with respiratory depression and altered mental status after consumption of over 3200 mg kratom (114755).\nTreatment\nTreatment of kratom overdose is comprised of supportive care, including intravenous fluids, intralipid, benzodiazepines, supplemental oxygen, naloxone, naltrexone, sedation, intubation, antiemetics, vasopressors, and hemodialysis (104637, 108763, 108765, 113070, 113071). For sympathetic overactivation, labetalol has been administered (113071). In some cases, patients have experienced rebound respiratory depression and other symptoms within 24 hours of naloxone administration. These patients may require repeated naloxone doses, supplemental oxygen, or other supportive care (114755).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn healthy adults, a single dose of kratom 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg, containing mitragynine 13.3, 26.6, and 53.2 mg respectively, yields a mitragynine Cmax of 32, 57, and 125 ng/mL, each with Tmax of 1.3 hours and 24-hour area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of 108, 244, and 558 h*ng/mL, respectively. (115444). Additional pharmacokinetic studies of single or repeated doses of kratom yield similar results (115451, 115444).\n\nEvidence from animal research suggests that absorption of mitragynine, a component of kratom, is incomplete and slow; absolute oral bioavailability is 3.03% (27145). Steady-state pharmacokinetic animal research suggests sex differences, with oral administration yielding a higher maximum plasma concentration and higher area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) in female rats than male rats (115448).\nDistribution\nIn a small clinical study in chronic users, the estimated volume of distribution of mitragynine was 38 L/kg (95818). In vitro research suggests that the kratom compounds mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine penetrate the blood brain barrier via passive diffusion. These constituents also appear to be highly protein bound in the plasma (95819).\nMetabolism\nIn a small clinical study in chronic users, excretion of unchanged mitragynine in the urine was about 0.14%, suggesting that mitragynine is primarily metabolized by the liver (95797, 95818). The primary metabolite of mitragynine is 7-hydroxymitragynine. Clinical research in healthy adults, shows that ingestion of single does of kratom 1000-4000 mg, containing mitragynine 13.3-53.2 mg yields a 7-hydroxymitragynine Cmax of 6.6-22.7 ng/mL at 1.5-1.8,hours .Ingestion of the aforementioned doses daily for 15 days yielded similar Cmax and Tmax values for 7-hydroxymitragynine. However, there was significant variability between study participants (155444). In animal research, metabolites of mitraciliatine, speciogynine, and isopaynantheine, compounds found in kratom, were found in the blood (27139, 27142). In animal research, paynantheine or mitragynine, resulted in 9-O-demethyl paynantheine, 16-carboxy paynantheine, 9-O-demethyl-16-carboxy paynantheine, 17-O-demethyl paynantheine, 17-O-demethyl-16,17-dihydro paynantheine, 9,17-O-bisdemethyl paynantheine, 9,17-O-bisdemethyl-16,17-dihydro paynantheine, 17-carboxy-16,17-dihydro paynantheine, and 9-O-demethyl-17-carboxy-16,17-dihydro paynantheine as phase I metabolites in the urine (27143, 27146).\n\nSteady-state pharmacokinetic animal research suggests sex differences in metabolism, with oral administration of mitragynine yielding a higher area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of 7-hydroxymitragynine and other metabolites in female rats than male rats (115448).\nExcretion\nA small clinical study shows that after ingestion of 25 mL of kratom tea containing 23.6 mg of mitragynine the elimination half-life is about 8.7 hours for mitragynine and 7.4 hours for its primary metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine (115451).\n\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that after ingestion of a single dose of oral encapsulated dried kratom leaf powder 500-4000 mg, containing mitragynine 6.65-53.2 mg the half life is 8.5-43.4 hours, and the half life of 7-hydroxymitragynine is 1.7-4.7 hours. When these same 4 doses were consumed daily for 15 days, the half life of mitragynine is 25.7-67.9 hours, while the half-life of 7-hydroxymitragynine is 2.4-24.7 hours (115444).\n\nIn a small clinical study in chronic users that consumed 4 kratom leaves up to 9 times daily, oral consumption of 60-120 mL kratom tea containing about 0.1 to 0.2 mg/mL mitragynine (6-24 mg mitragynine per dose) resulted in a long half-life of about 1 day. This means it would take about 5 days to clear most of the kratom tea to from the body. Excretion of the unchanged mitragynine in the urine was about 0.14%, suggesting that mitragynine is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted in the feces (95797, 95818).\n\nEvidence from animal research suggests that mitragynine shows biphasic elimination from plasma after intravenous administration, with a half-life of 2.9 hours and a clearance rate of 0.29 L/hr/kg (27145), while the elimination of mitragynine following oral administration is slower, with a half-life of 3.8-9.4 hours and a clearance rate of 1.6-7 L/hr/kg (26208, 26209, 27145). Steady-state pharmacokinetic animal research suggests sex differences in excretion. Oral administration of mitragynine 40 mg/kg every 12 hours for 5-6 days results in renal clearance of mitragynine of 0.64 mL/h in male rats and 0.98 mL/h in female rats. (115448).\n\nMitragynine, as well as speciociliatine, speciogynine, mitraciliatine, paynantheine, and O-desmethyltramadol have been found in the urine of individuals who have consumed kratom (27133, 27135, 27140, 27141). Mitragynine has three other diastereomers, mitraciliatine, speciogynine, and speciociliatine, which vary in relative proportions and urinary concentrations depending on geographical location, climate, and preparation method of kratom (113060). The urinary glycoprotein AZ122 is a sensitive and specific biomarker for habitual kratom use ranging from 1 to 20 years (113063).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of kratom is the leaf (104634, 104635). Kratom contains corynantheidine, isopaynantheine, mitraciliatine, mitragynine, paynantheine, speciociliatine, speciogynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and 9-hydroxycorynantheidine (27117, 27118, 27139, 27140, 27142, 27143, 27144, 103219, 104635, 115443). Mitragynine is the most abundant alkaloid in kratom and is metabolized primarily to 7-hydroxymitragynine (115444). The alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are thought to be the main active constituents of kratom (95797). Twenty kratom leaves are estimated to contain about 18 mg of mitragynine (95802). Mitragynine makes up 60% of kratom's alkaloid content, while 7-hydroxymitragynine makes up 2%(95801) Mitragynine makes up 2% to 6% of the dried kratom plant material by weight, while 7-hydroxymitragynine makes up 0.04% by weight (95804, 95819). An analysis of samples showed that most products contain mitragynine at levels between 3.3-11.3 mg/gram raw material. However, some samples contain as much as 59.8 mg/gram (104635, 115443).\n\nSome kratom products have been suspected to be adulterated with respect to these constituents. In a laboratory study, samples of kratom products available on the market were believed to be adulterated with higher concentrations of the constituent 7-hydroxymitragynine compared to what is normally present in kratom plants. The 7-hydroxymitragynine concentration was found to be 0.09-0.59 mg/gram in capsules, which is up to 4.5-fold higher than what is naturally present in kratom leaves (95801).\nAddictive effects\nIn an animal model, administering kratom leaf constituent mitragynine causes some withdrawal signs and upregulates calcium-binding proteins calretinin, F-actin, annexin A3, and beta-centractin when compared with control and similarly to morphine. The upregulation of proteins was greater at higher doses and longer durations of mitragynine administration. Researchers theorize that mitragynine blocks calcium ion channels leading to the upregulation of calcium-binding proteins, particularly calretinin, which is highly expressed in excitability neurons and modulates calcium signaling. Calretinin upregulation reduces GABA release, thereby increasing dopamine release, and leading to kratom dependence (112843).\nAdrenergic effects\nIn vitro research shows that some constituents of kratom bind to alpha adrenergic receptors. Corynantheidine has higher affinity for adrenergic receptors than it does for opioid receptors. Mitragynine also has affinity for adrenergic receptors, but its affinity is lower than corynantheidine. Additional research shows that mitragynine is a partial agonist at alpha-1A and -1D adrenergic receptors and displays competitive antagonism at alpha-1A, -1B, -1D, and -2C adrenergic receptors (103219).\nAnalgesic effects\nKratom has been used for chronic pain due to its analgesic effects. Kratom contains mitragynine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist that is about 25% as potent as morphine (27126, 27128, 27130, 95799, 95819, 103219). Another mu-opioid agonist in kratom, 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is present in much smaller quantities, has been estimated to be 10 times as potent as morphine (95799). In mice, administration of 7-hydroxymitragynine demonstrated high abuse potential and increased intake of other opiates. Administration of mitragynine, on the other hand, reduced the overall intake of morphine and did not demonstrate abuse potential (101704). Mitragynine has also been shown to be effective for mitigating symptoms of morphine withdrawal in rats, albeit at larger doses when compared with methadone and buprenorphine (103220). Higher doses of kratom 5-15 grams are said to produce analgesic opioid-like effects, while doses of 1-5 grams have stimulating effects (95800, 95802, 95804).\n\nOf the constituents in kratom, 7-hydroxymitragynine has the highest affinity for mu opioid receptors, followed by speciociliatine, 9-hydroxycorynantheidine, corynantheidine, and then mitragynine. Additionally, 7-hydroxymitragynine has the highest affinity for kappa opioid receptors, followed by speciociliatine, mitragynine, and then corynantheidine. Mitragynine has a similar affinity for both mu and kappa opioid receptors, while 7-hydroxymitragynine, corynantheidine, and speciociliatine have greater affinity for mu opioid receptors than for kappa opioid receptors (103219).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn an animal model of type 2 diabetes, administration of kratom improves body weight, food intake, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum insulin, and measures of insulin resistance when compared with the diabetic control group and similarly to metformin. Kratom also improves markers of liver and kidney function and prevents pancreatic histopathological damage when compared with diabetic control groups. Researchers theorize that kratom inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes, preventing intestinal carbohydrate metabolism and subsequent elevations in postprandial glucose levels (113086).\nAntidopaminergic effects\nThere is interest in using kratom to treat alcohol use disorder. Some research shows that oral intake of a methanolic extract of kratom inhibits ethanol seeking behavior in mice. This is thought to be due to antidopaminergic activity, as kratom was also found to attenuate alcohol-induced elevations in dopamine levels in these mice (103218).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn an animal model of diabetes, kratom administration improves biomarkers of oxidative stress as indicated by increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione and reduced malondialdehyde when compared with diabetic controls (113086).\nCardiotoxic effects\nKratom use can increase the risk of tachycardia (95819, 101707, 104636, 104637). In vitro, the constituent mitragynine can inhibit the activity of potassium channels in the myocardial cells (104636).\nCognitive effects\nAnimal research suggests that the primary kratom alkaloid mitragynine 3-30 mg/kg and lyophilized kratom decoction (LKD) exposure during adolescence can cause cognitive and behavioral deficits resulting from altered brain metabolites in cognition-associated brain regions (113082, 113087). Acute administration of mitragynine and LKD does not impair short-term recognition memory, long-term recognition memory, or spatial learning but does seem to harm reference memory (113087). However, when the same test was replicated after the animals reached adulthood, high-dose mitragynine impaired long-term recognition memory while both mitragynine and LKD impaired reference memory. Furthermore, there was no impact on short-term recognition memory in adult animals previously exposed to mitragynine and LKD as adolescents (113082).\n\nAdditionally, acute mitragynine and LKD exposure decreases social interaction and exploratory behaviors similarly to morphine, suggesting that kratom may result in anxiogenic effects and social withdrawal in adolescents (113087). However, the social behavioral deficits were absent in adult rats, suggesting that social effects are reversible after a period of kratom abstinence (113082).\n\nKratom-treated adolescent animals showed alterations in pathways involved in the metabolism of arachindonic acid, pantothenate and coenzyme A, tryptophan, and taurine and hypotaurine. These pathways are implicated in neuroplasticity, signal transduction, cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, and serotonin neurotransmission (113082, 113087).\nDepressant effects\nKratom contains mitragynine, a mu-receptor agonist that is believed to cause respiratory depression (95819). Although results from animal research suggest that mitragynine causes less respiratory depression than the CNS depressant codeine (27130), fatalities have been reported for patients who ingested a combination of kratom and O-desmethyltramadol, another mu-receptor agonist with depressant effects (27119, 27120).\nNeurologic effects\nKratom has reportedly been used for centuries for its psychoactive properties, opium-like effects, and ability to treat opioid addiction and opioid withdrawal (27121, 27122, 27123, 27124)."

Taking krill oil also appears to improve tear film stability and eye redness (96114).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Oral krill oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking capsules containing krill oil, zinc, vitamin D, sea buckthorn berry oil, cacao bean extract, hyaluronic acid, and red clover isoflavones (GliSODin Skin Nutrients Advanced Anti-Aging Formula, Isocell North America Inc.) 780 mg three times daily along with applying tazarotene cream 0.1% nightly for about 12 weeks improves fine wrinkles, overall sun damage, skin moisture, and skin elasticity when compared with tazarotene cream alone. It is not clear if these benefits are due to krill oil, other ingredients, or the combination (91778).\nless\nAlzheimer disease.

Although there has been interest in using oral krill oil for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of krill oil for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for improving cognitive function in children.\nA clinical trial shows that taking krill oil 4 grams daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 520 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 280 mg, usually for 12 months does not improve measures of cognitive function compared with placebo in school children (110372, 110374). Some of the children took krill oil 2 grams daily for 3 months before changing to 4 grams for the remaining 9 months. In addition, despite the relatively large number of children included in the study, conclusions are limited due to high drop-out and low adherence rates. The effect of krill oil on cognitive function in adults is not clear.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for depression in adolescents.\nIn adolescents with depressive feelings, preliminary clinical research shows that taking 4 capsules daily of krill oil for 3 months, and then 8 capsules daily for another 9 months, does not reduce self-reported depressive feelings or improve self-esteem when compared with placebo (104571). However, compliance was low. The krill oil product used provided eicosapentaenoic acid 65 mg and docosahexaenoic acid 35 mg per capsule. The effect of krill oil on clinical depression or in adults with depression is not clear.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for glycemic control.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, preliminary clinical research shows that taking two krill oil capsules daily providing omega-3 fatty acids 1000 mg for 4-21 weeks does not improve most glycemic indices when compared to olive oil. However, there was a small improvement in levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after 21 weeks (104572). Most patients in this study were also using oral hypoglycemic drugs.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for reducing pain or analgesic use.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 2 grams daily reduces the need for analgesics in females with dysmenorrhea by up to 50% from baseline (15754). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA small clinical trial in resistance-trained males shows that taking krill oil 3 grams daily for 3 days before a bout of muscle-damaging resistance exercise modestly reduces levels of serum creatine kinase 24 and 48 hours later compared with taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in agility in the first 24 hours and muscle strength over 72 hours. The krill oil provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 360 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 210 mg daily, as well as 2590 mcg daily astaxanthin. There were no effects of taking krill oil on levels of lactate dehydrogenase or on recovery for sprint time (110373). Preliminary clinical research in untrained males shows that taking a specific blend of krill oil and New Zealand green-lipped mussel lipid extract (ESPO-572, Pharmalink), at a dosage of 200 mg daily for 30 days, starting 26 days before a downhill run and following 72 hours post-exercise, reduces plasma creatine kinase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and improves joint range of motion, when compared with placebo. However, this combination was similarly effective to a lipid extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel (PCSO-524; Pharmalink), suggesting that any benefits may be due to New Zealand green-lipped mussel, as opposed to krill oil (105509).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Evidence for the use of oral krill oil for hyperlipidemia is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking krill oil reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 16 mg/dL in patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or normal lipid levels (96162). However, a sensitivity analysis reveals that this benefit is related to the inclusion of a single preliminary clinical trial. This trial shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 1-3 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with both fish oil and placebo in patients with hyperlipidemia (15753). When this study was removed from the meta-analysis, krill oil showed no significant benefit on LDL cholesterol levels (96162). However, the available clinical research has involved a range of doses, durations, and populations (15753, 19374, 96162). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in healthy volunteers or people with dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or cardiovascular disease shows that krill oil and fish oil similarly lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increase HDL cholesterol (104110).\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral krill oil for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of krill oil for this condition.\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for hypertriglyceridemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking krill oil reduces triglyceride levels by about 14 mg/dL in patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or normal lipid levels (96162). Another meta-analysis of two randomized, controlled trials in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking krill oil 4 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 26%, compared with a 15% reduction in the placebo group (107474). Also, a small clinical study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Superba Krill Oil, Aker BioMarine ASA) 0.5-4 grams in two divided doses daily for 12 weeks lowers triglyceride levels by 10% when compared with baseline. The effect does not appear to be dose-dependent, and there is significant variability in the triglyceride level changes. Krill oil did not affect levels of total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol (91600).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for weight loss.\nA small clinical trial in females with a body mass index (BMI) over 25 kg/m2 shows that taking krill oil (Pholias, Anapolis, Goias) 1.5 grams twice daily for 8 weeks, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 500 mg daily, does not affect anthropometric measures, including waist and abdominal circumference and BMI, compared with placebo (110371).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nClinical research in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking krill oil (Superba BOOST, Aker BioMarine) 4 grams daily for 6 months, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.6 grams, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.28 grams, and astaxanthin 0.45 mg daily, modestly improves knee pain, stiffness, and function, compared with taking placebo. However, it is unclear if any benefits are clinically significant and there was no effect on the estimated use of NSAIDs (110370). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that among patients with cardiovascular disease and either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 300 mg daily for 30 days improves pain by 38%, stiffness by 39%, and functionality by 36% when compared with baseline. These improvements are significantly greater than those seen with placebo (15760). The effects of krill oil specifically in patients with osteoarthritis is unclear from this study.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there has been interest in using oral krill oil for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of krill oil for this condition.\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms of PMS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 2 grams daily reduces self-reported symptoms of PMS (15754). However, the validity of these findings is limited by concerns with the study methodology. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product containing krill oil 350 mg, thiamine 1.4 mg, riboflavin 1.6 mg, vitamin B6 2 mg, soy isoflavones 50 mg, and rosemary extract 50 mg (Cleanmarine for Women, Novabrands Ltd. Co) two capsules daily for 3 months reduces anxiety, mood swings, breast tenderness, food cravings, bloating, skin outbreaks, forgetfulness, fatigue and insomnia, and headaches when compared with baseline. However, it is unclear if these improvements are due to krill oil, other ingredients, or the combination, and the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group (91604).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that among patients with cardiovascular disease and either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 300 mg daily for 30 days improves pain by 38%, stiffness by 39%, and functionality by 36% when compared with baseline. These improvements are significantly greater than those seen with placebo (15760).\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral krill oil is beneficial for improving muscle loss or strength in older adults.\nClinical research in inactive adults over age 65 years shows that taking krill oil (Superba BOOST, Aker BioMarine) 2 grams twice daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 772 mg, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 384 mg, and choline 316 mg, for 6 months modestly increases knee and grip strength, and muscle thickness, compared with taking placebo. Knee and grip strength increased by 7.1% and 8.8%, respectively, over baseline. Both improvements were statistically significant compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on general physical performance (110369).\nless\nStroke.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with krill oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCompared to fish oil, the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in krill oil products is usually lower. Some researchers have speculated that the phospholipid-bound EPA and DHA from krill oil is more bioavailable than the triglyceride-bound EPA and DHA from fish oil (15753, 104110). However, the evidence in humans is conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that there is a greater increase in plasma levels of EPA and DHA following supplementation with krill oil compared to fish oil (91602). However, other clinical research disagrees and shows that EPA and DHA from krill oil and fish oil are equally bioavailable (57836, 110345, 110375). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that EPA and DHA from krill meal, which is also incorporated into phospholipids, are not better absorbed than EPA and DHA from fish oil (91602).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nKrill oil contains significant amounts of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are incorporated into phospholipids (15753, 48193). These phospholipids primarily consist of phosphatidylcholine, with smaller amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine (15754, 15756, 48193, 57833, 57843).\n\nKrill oil also contains significant amounts of omega-9 fatty acids, but relatively small amounts of omega-6 fatty acids. Krill oil also provides triglycerides, vitamin A, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), marine derived tocopherol (alpha-tocomonoenol), astaxanthin, and a unique flavonoid (15754, 15756, 15757). The composition of krill oil can vary depending on the species of krill from which it is extracted.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLike fish oils, there is interest in using krill oil for preventing or treating inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and skin conditions. Most of the potential benefits are attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish and krill oils. These polyunsaturated fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. Although much research exists on omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils, there is very little research on the use of fatty acids from krill oil. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 300 mg daily significantly reduces C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis (15760). However, other clinical research does not show that taking krill oil reduces levels of CRP (110369, 110370). In humans with dry eye disease, taking fish oil decreases levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 (96114). However, some clinical research shows that taking krill oil increases antioxidant effects but does not reduce levels of the inflammatory mediators IL-2, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (110373). Animal research shows that krill oil can decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joints of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (57840).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that krill oil can reduce the accumulation of triglycerides in adipocyte cells, possibly by decreasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-alpha (57847). Theoretically, this may help prevent the development of obesity.\nAnticancer effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that krill oil can inhibit growth of colon cancer cells (57829). A specific mechanism of action for this anticancer effect is unclear.\nCardiovascular effects\nLike fish oils, there is interest in using krill oil for preventing cardiovascular disease and related conditions. Most of the potential benefits are attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish and krill oils. These polyunsaturated fatty acids have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Although much research exists on omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils, there is very little research on the use of fatty acids from krill oil. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific krill oil product (Neptune Krill Oil, Neptune Technologies & Bioresources, Inc.) 300 mg daily significantly reduces C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to placebo in people with cardiovascular disease (15760). In addition, taking krill oil has been shown to increase endothelial function (104572).\nHepatic effects\nIn mice fed a high-fat diet, krill oil appears to reduce liver weight and total liver fat, possibly by reducing hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol (19376).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn some research in humans and animals, krill oil appears to decrease blood glucose levels (15753, 19376). However, not all research agrees (104572). A specific mechanism of action is unknown.\nHypolipemic effects\nKrill oil is thought to reduce the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol (96162).\nImmune-related effects\nThere is interest in krill oil and other fish oils for autoimmune diseases. In autoimmune disease-prone animal models, krill oil seems to increase hepatic antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Krill oil also increases hepatic levels of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and decreases levels of arachidonic acid (15755).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking krill oil 0.50 grams twice daily at breakfast and dinner for 12 weeks increases concentrations of oxyhemoglobin in the cerebral cortex during working memory tasks in healthy, elderly men. Increased oxyhemoglobin levels correlate with increased brain activity, suggesting that krill oil may help prevent or treat age-related cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear if the increased brain activity correlate with improved performance on working memory tasks (91603).\nRenal effects\nIn female rats particularly sensitive to diet-induced alterations in kidney function, krill protein concentrate supplementation resulted in higher glomerular filtration rates and lower proteinuria and lower urinary n-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) levels and minimal microtubular calcium deposition (57839)."

Oral kudzu seems to be beneficial for reducing alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers; however, it may not be beneficial in those with chronic alcohol use disorder.\nSome research shows that heavy drinkers who take a specific kudzu root extract (Alkontrol-Herbal; NPI-031; Natural Pharmacia International, Inc.) 0.5-1 grams three times daily for 1-4 weeks consume less beer when given an opportunity to drink and may have more abstinent days (13085, 92257). Other research shows that binge drinkers who take kudzu extract 2 grams as a single dose 2.5 hours prior to a 90-minute binge drinking episode consume 37% fewer beers than those taking placebo (92258). However, kudzu does not seem to decrease the craving for alcohol (10386, 13085, 57948, 92257).

It is unclear if oral kudzu is beneficial for diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking oral puerarin, a kudzu constituent, 250 mg three times daily in addition to rosiglitazone 4 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared to baseline (57951). The effect of kudzu alone is unclear. Additionally, the lack of a comparator group limits the validity of this finding.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy.

The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Small clinical studies suggest that oral kudzu may modestly improve menopausal symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking kudzu 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg daily for 6 months during perimenopause improves climacteric symptoms based on a modified Green climacteric scale when compared with baseline (57890, 57942). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking kudzu extract 0.84-2.52 grams daily for 4 weeks, providing puerarin 113-338 mg daily, modestly reduces overall menopausal symptoms when compared with baseline (108154). The validity of the findings from these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.

However, doses of 200 mg do not seem to be as effective (57954).\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. It is unclear if oral or intravaginal kudzu is beneficial for postmenopausal conditions.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal individuals shows that taking kudzu containing isoflavones 100 mg orally once daily for 3 months improves flexible thinking and attention when compared with control. However, it does not appear to improve total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or sex hormone levels (11386). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal individuals shows that taking kudzu 20 mg, 30 mg, or 50 mg daily for 24 weeks improves vaginal dryness and pH when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. It also decreases a specific biomarker of bone turnover, called bone alkaline phosphatase, when compared with placebo (57924, 57929). It is unclear if this correlates with improved bone density or with a reduced risk of osteoporosis.\n\nKudzu has also been evaluated as an intravaginal gel. One small clinical study shows that applying 0.5 grams of kudzu 6% gel into the vagina every night for 2 weeks, followed by 3 nights each week for 9 weeks, improves vaginal symptoms of dryness, soreness, irritation, and abnormal discharge similarly to conjugated estrogen cream applied on the same schedule. However, kudzu gel is less effective than conjugated estrogen cream for improving overall vaginal health (96740). Another small clinical study of postmenopausal patients shows that applying 0.5 grams of kudzu 6% gel intravaginally every night for 3 weeks increases vaginal arterial blood flow and restores atrophic vaginal tissue when compared with placebo after 12 weeks (110702). In contrast, a similar study shows that applying 0.5 grams of kudzu 5% gel into the vagina every night for 2 weeks, followed by 3 nights each week for 10 weeks, does not improve vaginal symptoms when compared with placebo gel (105521). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nRhinosinusitis.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with kudzu.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal and human research, unmetabolized puerarin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a peak in under 2 hours. However, the absorption is incomplete (57898, 57923, 57960). In animal research, daidzin is more bioavailable when consumed in kudzu when compared with being consumed alone, suggesting other constituents in kudzu increase absorption (57963).\nDistribution\nIn animal research, puerarin is found in various organs including the kidney, liver, spleen, and brain (57898, 57960). Also, puerarin and other isoflavonoids found in kudzu, such as 3′-methoxypuerarin, 3′-hydroxypuerarin, daidzein, and daidzein-8-C-piosyl-(1-6)-glycoside, are also distributed to the brain when kudzu is given intravenously (92263).\nMetabolism\nIn animal research, after absorption from the gut, puerarin is metabolized to mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives (57898).\nExcretion\nIn animal research, puerarin metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces (57898). In human research, the half-life of puerarin via the oral route was found to be approximately 4.3 hours (57923).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of kudzu are the root, flower, and leaf. Kudzu contains isoflavone constituents including daidzin, daidzein, puerarin, tectoridin, tectorigenin, glycitin, glycitein, biochanin A, genistin, and genistein (11711, 13085, 13295, 57894, 57948, 57954, 57969, 92257, 92258, 92263). Kudzu also contains spinatserol (57918) and triterpenoids (57944).\nAlcohol effects\nKudzu extracts or individual isoflavones such as daidzin consistently suppress voluntary alcohol intake in rodent models of alcohol use disorder (1523, 1524, 13289, 13290, 57965). Kudzu extract, daidzein, and daidzin decrease alcohol consumption and shorten alcohol-induced sleep in alcohol-craving animals. Preclinical research suggests kudzu causes later and lower peak blood alcohol levels and a flattened dose response curve (13297). Kudzu might decrease peak blood alcohol levels due to delayed gastric emptying, exposing alcohol to a longer time for first-pass metabolism in the stomach (1523, 1524). Slowed gastric emptying might prolong the effects of alcohol.\n\nOther research suggests kudzu might have antioxidant effects and speed up the metabolism of toxic alcohol metabolites (13294). Kudzu might also protect against ethanol-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells (57858). Preliminary research suggests the kudzu constituent puerarin might lessen feelings of anxiety associated with alcohol withdrawal (13293).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary laboratory and human research suggests that kudzu and its constituents, including puerarin, may inhibit inflammatory processes, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines (57900, 57931, 57938, 57939).\nAntilipemic effects\nKudzu and its constituents appear to have hypocholesterolemic activity (13285, 13286).\nAntioxidant effects\nKudzu or its constituents might have antioxidant activity (13285, 13288, 57871, 57887, 57907, 57919).\nAntipyretic effects\nKudzu might have antipyretic effects, possibly through the effect of puerarin on serotonin receptors (13281, 13282).\nAntithrombotic effects\nIn human and animal research, kudzu has antithrombotic and antiplatelet activity (13291, 57865, 57880, 57961). Puerarin also enhances the activity of fibrinolysis (57856).\nBone effects\nKudzu may have benefits for bone density. In human research, kudzu improves bone turnover markers in postmenopausal adults (57929, 108154). In animal research, kudzu has been shown to increase bone mineral density (57874). The constituent puerarin appears to play a role by suppressing bone resorption and promoting bone formation (57885, 57912).\nCardiovascular effects\nKudzu might have effects on the cardiovascular system. Preliminary research suggests kudzu has a protective effect against myocardial ischemia (13282). Puerarin seems to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diminish myocardial oxygen consumption (13279). Puerarin also might have vasorelaxant properties, possibly by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors (13283). There is also some evidence that puerarin might decrease plasma renin and angiotensin II activity, and platelet aggregation (13278, 13280, 13291). The kudzu constituent daidzein might also have antiarrhythmic properties (13284).\nCytochrome P450 system effects\nPreliminary research suggests that kudzu and puerarin both inhibit and induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. However, it is unclear which CYP isoenzymes are affected and to what degree (13288).\nEstrogenic effects\nThere is interest in using oral or topical kudzu root extract to treat postmenopausal vaginal symptoms. Isoflavone constituents have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, similar to selective estrogen receptor modulators (11386, 13295, 57874, 57877, 57896). These phytoestrogens might have additive or synergistic effects with each other (13295). In animal research, kudzu increases vaginal proliferation and decreases vaginal dryness, possibly related to constituent phytoestrogens (92254).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal individuals reports conflicting effects of applying kudzu gel to the vagina for vaginal symptoms of dryness, soreness, irritation, and abnormal discharge when compared with conjugated estrogen cream or placebo gel applied on the same schedule (96740, 105521). In one study, kudzu gel increased vaginal artery circulation and restored atrophic vaginal tissue. Researchers theorize that the improvement in vaginal blood flow and atrophy may be due to the estrogenic effects of kudzu (110702).\n\nApplying kudzu gel into the vagina does not appear to affect vaginal pH or endometrial thickness when compared with baseline or placebo gel, but this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference. In contrast, applying kudzu gel into the vagina does improve bacterial vaginosis scores when compared with placebo (105521). However, kudzu gel is less effective than conjugated estrogen cream in improving overall vaginal health and vaginal maturation, indicating lower total estrogen exposure when compared with estrogen cream (96740).\nHepatotoxic effects\nCase reports in humans suggest that kudzu may be hepatotoxic. Animal research confirms these effects (88777, 92259, 92260, 92262). Animal models suggest that the hepatotoxicity of kudzu may be related to adverse effects on hepatic cells causing apoptosis (92262). Histopathological changes of the liver confirm adverse effects related to kudzu with central hepatocellular necrosis and hemorrhage (92259).\n\nHowever, other preliminary research suggests that kudzu may be hepatoprotective against chemically-induced toxicity. Animal research shows that using the combination of kudzu and milk thistle has protective effects on alcoholic liver disease (102956). The reason for these conflicting findings is unclear.\nHypoglycemic effects\nKudzu or its constituents appear to have hypoglycemic activity (13285, 13292, 57868, 57951). Laboratory research suggests that puerarin increases glucose utilization (13292) and activates alpha1-adrenoceptors on the adrenal gland to enhance the secretion of beta-endorphin (57892, 57868) resulting in decreased plasma glucose.\nNeurologic effects\nKudzu may have neuroprotective effects as shown in laboratory in vitro and animal models (57851, 57861, 57885) and the constituent puerarin may enhance cerebral blood flow due to dilatation of the intracranial arteries (57964). Puerarin and 3′-methoxypuerarin may be the active neurological constituents of kudzu (92263).\nStroke effects\nResearch in animal models of stroke suggests an ethanolic extract of kudzu root can increase levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which might improve post-stroke depression (15498). In ischemic stroke, puerarin might reduce ischemic reperfusion injury by dilating cerebral vessels to improve circulation, reducing platelet aggregation, inhibiting free radical production, and increasing superoxide dismutase activity (16400)."
