            "Overview": "N,N-DMPEA is a chemically modified form of phenethylamine, a monoamine alkaloid found in plants, animals, and certain foods (24346, 24348, 24349, 24352, 24353, 95468). Phenethylamines such as N,N-DMPEA can also be found in various dietary supplements marketed for weight loss and athletic performance (95468). N,N-DMPEA is also a common food additive used for flavoring (95469).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used in small amounts for flavoring food (95469).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used ophthalmically. N,N-DMPEA 15% ophthalmic solution has been used with apparent safety for 21 days (95470).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in medicinal amounts. There is insufficient reliable evidence regarding the safety of oral N,N-DMPEA in humans. However, one case of hemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of a multi-ingredient supplement (Jacked Power, MM Sports) containing N,N-DMPEA has been reported. While further analysis showed that this supplement actually contained beta-methylphenylethylamine (BMPEA) and not N,N-DMPEA, patients should avoid taking products which include N,N-DMPEA on the label due to the overall lack of safety data and potential risk of unlisted ingredients (89219, 95472).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information is available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOphthalmically, N,N-DMPEA seems to be well tolerated. No adverse effects were reported in one clinical trial evaluating ophthalmic use of N,N-DMPEA for 21 days (95470). It is unknown whether N,N-DMPEA causes adverse effects when taken orally in amounts found in supplements.",

Specifically, phenethylamines occur naturally in small amounts in Acacia rigidula, bitter almond oil, and chocolate (95468). Phenethylamines induce serotonin and dopamine secretion and can have neurologically stimulating properties such as hallucinogenic effects. The specific systemic effects of N,N-DMPEA have not been studied (95468).\nOcular effects\nN,N-DMPEA has been studied for ophthalmic use to alleviate dry eye. It seems to increase the protein content of tears, increase tear stability, and decrease tear surface tension. This may be due to N,N-DMPEA stimulating lacrimal sigma receptors and increasing protein content and tear lipocalin (95470, 95471)."

    "N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the amino acid L-cysteine. In the body, it is a source of sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, which allows it to act as a potent antioxidant. Also, N-acetyl cysteine increases glutathione levels in the body; glutathione deficiency is associated with a variety of pathological conditions (7868, 64613, 64681, 64765, 64770, 64785).",
            "Warnings": "N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is approved as a drug by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because it was approved as a drug before being marketed as a dietary supplement, the FDA considers NAC an unlawful ingredient in dietary supplements and has issued multiple warning letters for dietary supplement products containing NAC (104163). However, in August 2022, the FDA stated that it is considering a rule to allow the sale of NAC as a dietary supplement. Until a final ruling is made, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for sale and distribution of NAC as a dietary supplement, provided the products are not otherwise in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (108940).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using N-acetyl cysteine for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally, intravenously, intratracheally, or by inhalation and appropriately. N-acetyl cysteine is an FDA-approved prescription drug (832, 1539, 1705, 1710, 2245, 2246, 2252, 2253, 2254, 2256)(2258, 2259, 2260, 5808, 6176, 6611, 7868, 10270, 10271, 16840)(91243, 91247, 102027, 102660, 102666, 99531).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. N-acetyl cysteine has been safely used at doses of 900-2700 mg daily for 8-12 weeks (91235, 91239, 91241, 102666). ...when used intravenously and appropriately. Intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 140 mg/kg/day plus oral N-acetyl cysteine 70 mg/kg four times daily for up to 10 months has been safely used (64547).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, intratracheally, intravenously, or by inhalation. N-acetyl cysteine crosses the placenta, but has not been associated with adverse effects to the fetus (1711, 64615, 64493, 97041). However, N-acetyl cysteine should only be used in pregnancy when clearly indicated, such as in cases of acetaminophen toxicity.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, intravenously, and as an inhalation, N-acetyl cysteine is generally well-tolerated when used in typical doses. Most adverse effects to N-acetyl cysteine occur when single doses of greater than 9 grams are used or when a regimen of greater than 30 grams daily is followed.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, heartburn, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nIntravenously: Skin rash and hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nInhaled: Bronchospasm, cough, epigastric pain, throat irritation, and wheezing.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Chest tightness, hemoptysis, and palpitations have been reported.\n\nIntravenously: Anaphylaxis, angina, dystonic reactions, tachycardia, and transient sinus bradycardia have been reported.\nCardiovascular\nIntravenously, N-acetyl cysteine has been reported to significantly increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure after exposure to nitroglycerin when compared with placebo (2280). Tachycardia, chest pain, angina, and transient sinus bradycardia have been rarely reported after administration of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine (2280, 7872, 64658).\n\nIntratracheally, infants receiving 5% N-acetyl cysteine every four hours for chronic lung disease have developed bradycardia (64490).\n\nOrally, palpitations and chest tightness have been reported rarely in clinical research evaluating oral N-acetyl cysteine at doses up to 600 mg twice daily (64675, 64717, 64762).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, N-acetyl cysteine may cause hives (64713, 64739, 64813), flushing (2260, 64715), and edema (64714). Rash has also been reported (64510, 64715, 64717, 102656). In one study, flushing was reported in 2% of patients receiving 600 mg of N-acetyl cysteine orally twice daily for six months (2260).\n\nIntravenously, N-acetyl cysteine may cause rash, and the occurrence seems to be more common than with oral use (2254, 64492, 64562, 64658, 64759, 64794). Hives (2280, 64794), facial edema (2280), flushing (64412), and pruritus (64658, 64763) have also been reported. In a small case series of 10 healthy male patients receiving 150 mg/kg of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine for muscle fatigue, erythema was experienced 30 minutes after infusion. Other side effects reported by these patients include facial erythema, palmar erythema, and sweating (64763). In other clinical research, three patients developed an erythematous flare at the sites of previous venipunctures after receiving 5.5 gm/m2 of N-acetyl cysteine with doxorubicin therapy (64712). Pain, inflammation, and excoriation of the skin have been reported after a 20% N-acetyl cysteine solution leaked from the catheter in one patient (64726).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, gastrointestinal complaints are the most common adverse effects reported with N-acetyl cysteine. These include heartburn (64608, 64715, 64717, 64738, 64739, 102666), dyspepsia (1710, 64715, 64717, 64724, 64738), and epigastric pain (2260, 10429, 64715, 64717). In one case report, esophagitis related to ulcerations occurred following intake of N-acetyl cysteine while in the supine position with inadequate water (102655). Other common side effects include loss of appetite (64715, 64812), flatulence (2256, 64510), diarrhea (64713, 64715, 97049), constipation (64715), dry mouth (64715, 64724), nausea (7868, 11430, 64715, 64724, 64738, 64812, 97049), vomiting (64717, 64724, 64715, 97049), gastric upset (64510, 64545, 97045, 97049), acid reflux (108450), changes in bowel habits (108450), and intolerance to taste and odor (64510, 64545). N-acetyl cysteine's unpleasant odor makes it difficult for some patients to take orally. Using a straw to drink N-acetyl cysteine solutions can improve tolerability. Additionally, placement of a nasogastric or duodenal tube and administration of metoclopramide or ondansetron can be helpful for patients unable to tolerate oral N-acetyl cysteine (17).\n\nIntravenously, N-acetyl cysteine may cause diarrhea (64712), dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting (64763), mild gastrointestinal upset (102657), and metallic taste (64763).\n\nWhen inhaled, N-acetyl cysteine may cause epigastric pain and throat irritation (64703, 64707, 64674).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, dysuria was reported in 2% of patients receiving 600 mg of N-acetyl cysteine twice daily for 6 months in one clinical trial (2260).\nless\nHematologic\nIn general, hematologic adverse reactions are reported more frequently with intravenous N-acetyl cysteine compared with oral use. In surgical patients, decreased prothrombin time (1341, 64511), prolonged coagulation time (64511), increased blood loss (64511, 64644), and decreased platelet aggregation (64511) have been reported after administration of IV N-acetyl cysteine. In one clinical trial, six healthy patients were administered a loading dose of IV N-acetyl cysteine 10 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg per hour for 32 hours. All patients experienced a decrease in prothrombin time by 30% to 40%. The decrease prothrombin time (25.4 sec to 20.6 sec) reached a steady state after 16 hours (1341). In a clinical trial evaluating patients with acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhage occurred in three patients taking intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 10 mg/min, heparin (per study protocol), and aspirin (7872). Two pediatric patients receiving intravenous N-acetyl cysteine (loading dose: 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg) experienced episodes of coagulopathy; however, patients were being treated for acetaminophen overdose (64794).\n\nHemoptysis was reported in six patients receiving 200 mg of N-acetyl cysteine orally twice daily for 6 months for treatment of chronic bronchitis (64739).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, anaphylaxis to N-acetyl cysteine has been rarely reported (64794). However, anaphylactic reactions to intravenous N-acetyl cysteine appear to be more common (1716, 64412, 64449, 64628, 64710, 64711, 64721, 64786, 64789).\n\nAnaphylactic reactions to N-acetyl cysteine have involved rash, angioedema, hypotension, and bronchospasm (64449, 64711, 64720). The mechanism of this reaction is unclear, but some data suggest it is not an immunologic hypersensitivity reaction but rather an acute toxic effect of N-acetyl cysteine (64786, 64641, 64720). Management guidelines for the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions to intravenous N-acetyl cysteine have been published. In most cases, treatment is not required or treatment with diphenhydramine or salbutamol is sufficient to continue or restart N-acetyl cysteine infusion. Antihistamines are useful in controlling and preventing recurrence of anaphylactoid symptoms (1716).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn one clinical trial, joint pain was reported in more than 15% of patients receiving oral N-acetyl cysteine (64608). In other research, one patient experienced pain in the legs while taking 600 mg of N-acetyl cysteine twice daily for the treatment of chronic bronchitis (64762).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, headache has been frequently reported with N-acetyl cysteine in clinical research (7873, 11430, 64510, 64608, 64672, 64713, 64715, 64724, 64762). Other less common adverse effects reported in patients taking oral N-acetyl cysteine at a total daily dose of 600-1200 mg include dizziness (64715, 64717, 64724, 64762), tiredness (64675, 64717), vivid dreams (102666), disorientation, and inability to concentrate (64673). One pediatric patient receiving oral N-acetyl cysteine (loading dose: 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg) experienced encephalopathy (64794).\n\nIntravenously, N-acetyl cysteine has been associated with rare neurologic adverse reactions , including headache (7872), lightheadedness (64763), and dystonic reactions (64794). In a previously healthy 2-year-old female, status epilepticus occurred during intravenous N-acetyl cysteine therapy for paracetamol ingestion (64781). Increased deterioration in bulbar function in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has also been reported with IV N-acetyl cysteine (2254).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nWhile rare, blurred vision has been reported in research on oral N-acetyl cysteine (64715). Additionally, in a previously healthy 2-year-old female, status epilepticus followed by cortical blindness occurred during intravenous N-acetyl cysteine therapy for paracetamol ingestion. In this case, vision was almost completely recovered 18-months later (64781).\nless\nPsychiatric\nIntravenously, dysphoria was experienced 30 minutes after infusion of N-acetyl cysteine in 8 of 10 healthy males assessed in one clinical study (64763).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nRespiratory adverse reactions to N-acetyl cysteine are most commonly reported with inhalable dosage forms. These include wheezing (64455, 64707), bronchospasm (64455, 64699), and cough (64455, 64456, 64703, 64811). While less frequent, wheezing (64675), bronchospasm (64675), increased sputum production (7868), cough (7868, 64510), decreased peak flow (64510), dyspnea (64714), and cold symptoms (64510) have been reported with oral N-acetyl cysteine in clinical research. A few cases of wheezing (64718, 64719), cough (64763), and bronchospasm (64658) have also been reported with intravenous N-acetyl cysteine. Additionally, respiratory arrest has been reported in one case where a 16 year-old female was being treated for acetaminophen toxicity with intravenous N-acetyl cysteine (64450).\n\nTwo premature infants receiving 5% N-acetyl cysteine via intratracheal instillation for the treatment of chronic lung disease had an increased frequency of cyanotic spells (64490).\nless\nOther\nInjection site reactions, including burning and phlebitis, have been reported in patients receiving IV N-acetyl cysteine (1341, 64763). Fever associated with IV N-acetyl cysteine was reported in one patient during clinical research (64759).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nAcetaminophen poisoning. Oral and intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, as prescription drug products, are effective for treating acetaminophen poisoning.\nAdministering prescription N-acetyl cysteine orally or intravenously is effective in decreasing mortality rate and preventing the permanent sequelae of acetaminophen poisoning (17, 64513, 64745, 64746). N-acetyl cysteine injection and oral effervescent tablets are approved by the US FDA for this use (102147, 104164).\nless\nAtelectasis. When inhaled, N-acetyl cysteine is effective for treating atelectasis.\nN-acetyl cysteine solution for inhalation is effective for atelectasis caused by mucus obstruction (15, 91650) and is approved by the US FDA for this use (102147).\nless\nBronchial diagnostic studies. When inhaled, N-acetyl cysteine is effective for bronchial diagnostic study preparation.\nN-acetyl cysteine solution for inhalation is helpful when used to prepare people for bronchial diagnostic studies (15, 91650), and is approved by the US FDA for this use (102147).\nless\nTracheostomy care. When inhaled and used as adjunct therapy, N-acetyl cysteine is effective for preventing endotracheal crusting in patients with a tracheostomy.\nN-acetyl cysteine solution for inhalation is effective when used as an adjunct for preventing endotracheal crusting in tracheostomy care (15), and is approved by the US FDA for this use (102147).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAngina. Oral or intravenous N-acetyl cysteine may reduce nitroglycerin tolerance in patients with angina. However, some studies suggest that N-acetyl cysteine might increase the risk for severe headaches and hypotension when used with intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin.\nAdministering N-acetyl cysteine orally or intravenously, in combination with nitroglycerin, seems to improve unstable angina pectoris (2245, 2246). There is also some clinical research showing that concurrent intravenous or oral administration of N-acetyl cysteine reduces the development of nitroglycerin tolerance (832, 2245, 64546). However, other research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally does not reduce the development of nitroglycerin tolerance in angina patients (2281, 2282). Additionally, severe headache and hypotension can occur when oral N-acetyl cysteine and nitroglycerin are administered together, which may limit the feasibility of concomitant use (2245).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Oral N-acetyl cysteine may improve irritability, but not other symptoms, associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nOne small clinical study in children with autism shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 900 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms of irritability when compared with placebo (91241). Another small clinical study in children and adolescents with autism shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg daily plus risperidone for 8 weeks is more effective than risperidone alone for reducing irritability (91239). However, it does not seem to improve other symptoms, such as hyperactivity, social withdrawal, lethargy, repetitive behaviors, and inappropriate speech (91239, 91241, 97047).\nless\nBronchitis. Via inhalation, N-acetyl cysteine is FDA-approved for managing acute episodes of bronchitis. Oral N-acetyl cysteine may help to reduce the occurrence of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis when used for 3-36 months.\nN-acetyl cysteine solution for inhalation is FDA-approved for the management of acute bronchopulmonary disease, including bronchitis (102147). Taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200-1500 mg daily orally for 4 months seems to reduce shortness of breath and coughing, and improve lung capacity, in patients with sulfur mustard-induced bronchitis (64586, 64614). Also, taking N-acetyl cysteine orally, usually 400-600 mg daily, seems to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis by a moderate amount when used for 3-36 months (6176, 64419, 102660). Symptom improvement has been shown to occur in 61% of patients taking N-acetyl cysteine, compared with 34% of those taking placebo (102660). However, oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to have a beneficial effect on chronic bronchitis when administered for shorter durations (64685, 64696, 64737, 64818).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Taking N-acetyl cysteine orally seems to decrease the exacerbation rate and improve symptoms in patients with moderate to severe COPD, particularly those who are not taking inhaled corticosteroids. Also, taking N-acetyl cysteine along with standard therapy appears to improve recovery in patients hospitalized due to an acute exacerbation.\nN-acetyl cysteine solution for inhalation is FDA-approved for the management of chronic bronchopulmonary disease, such as COPD (102147). A meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies involving 2,691 patients shows that N-acetyl cysteine, given as 257-1800 mg daily for at least 6 months, decreases the number of patients experiencing at least one COPD exacerbation by 15% when compared with placebo; however, it is not associated with a reduction in COPD exacerbation rate or improvement in measures of lung function (97046). Some smaller studies have shown a higher improvement rate of 23% to 40%, with the greatest efficacy seen in patients who are not already taking inhaled corticosteroids (10429, 64552). While some studies have failed to show any benefit of N-acetyl cysteine, the lack of benefit appears to correlate with a treatment duration of less than 6 months (64704, 97039, 97046). The 2015 guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society (AECOPD) recommend that N-acetyl cysteine be considered as an adjunctive treatment option for patients with moderate to severe COPD and a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous 2 years (97043). The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline also states that N-acetyl cysteine may be an appropriate treatment option for patients who are not able to use inhaled corticosteroids (97050).\n\nIn hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD, preliminary clinical research shows that adding N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg daily to regular treatment has a moderate effect on wheeze and the need for oxygen over a 7-day period when compared with regular treatment alone (102653).\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. Oral or intravenous administration of N-acetyl cysteine seems to prevent contrast induced nephropathy in patients with kidney dysfunction. However, it is not beneficial in those with normal kidney function or diabetes.\nLarge meta-analyses of over 150 clinical studies in patients with reduced kidney function (serum creatinine of 1.2-2.4 mg/dL) show that oral N-acetyl cysteine is more effective than either sodium bicarbonate or saline hydration alone in preventing contrast agent-induced kidney damage after coronary angiography, computed tomography, left heart catheterization, and/or percutaneous coronary intervention. N-acetyl cysteine in combination with sodium bicarbonate appears to have similar efficacy to N-acetyl cysteine monotherapy, with an odds ratio of 0.62-0.67, when compared with hydration alone. Pretreatment with high-dose statin, prostaglandin, or theophylline appears to be more effective than N-acetyl cysteine, with odds ratios of 0.37, 0.37, and 0.48, respectively, when compared with hydration alone. However, combination treatment with N-acetyl cysteine and a high-dose statin appears to provide the greatest benefit of all treatments studied, with an odds ratio of 0.31, when compared with hydration alone. No treatments demonstrate significant efficacy in reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients with diabetes (97036, 97038). Some evidence also suggests that N-acetyl cysteine may have similar effects to fenoldopam in reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients with reduced kidney function (64489, 97036, 97038). N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients with normal kidney function (mean serum creatinine less than 1.2 mg/dL) when compared with control (64538, 64573, 64617). Although many individual studies have failed to show a significant benefit (11430, 64514, 64543, 64561, 64581, 64623, 64639, 91232, 91236, 106884), pooled evidence from these and many additional studies provide a benchmark for the place for N-acetyl cysteine in reducing the risk of contrast induced kidney damage in people with reduced kidney function.\nless\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Oral N-acetyl cysteine seems to reduce homocysteine levels.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally seems to reduce homocysteine levels in patients with elevated homocysteine levels, including those with kidney failure requiring dialysis (2258, 64542, 64596).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral N-acetyl cysteine seems to reduce lipoprotein(a) levels.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally seems to modestly reduce lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with hyperlipidemia (2256, 2257, 64516).\nless\nIfosfamide (Ifex) toxicity. Oral N-acetyl cysteine may be beneficial for reducing ifosfamide toxicity, although it does not appear to be as effective as mesna.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally seems to reduce ifosfamide-induced bladder toxicity (5808, 10270, 64730). However, mesna seems to be more effective for preventing ifosfamide toxicity than N-acetyl cysteine (10748).\nless\nInfluenza. Oral N-acetyl cysteine may reduce the risk for symptomatic influenza.\nOne multi-center clinical trial conducted in Italy shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for 6 months does not prevent influenza infection, but reduces the risk for clinically apparent disease by 68%, when compared with placebo (2260).\nless\nKidney failure. Oral N-acetyl cysteine may reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with kidney failure.\nOne clinical study in adults with kidney failure who have been on dialysis for at least 3 months shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events, such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, by about 40% when compared with placebo. There was no effect on total mortality or mortality from cardiovascular causes, although the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes (10430).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, along with standard therapy, seems to improve outcomes in patients with MI. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nClinical research in adults undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation MI shows that administering N-acetyl cysteine with nitroglycerin as a continuous intravenous infusion for 48 hours reduces myocardial infarct size by 5.5%, doubles the extent of myocardial salvage, and shortens the time to chest pain resolution when compared with nitroglycerin plus placebo (97044). Additional preliminary clinical research shows that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, when given with nitroglycerin and streptokinase in patients with evolving MI, may preserve left ventricular function and reduce oxidative stress (7872, 64502, 64778).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Subcutaneous administration of N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve survival or disease progression in patients with ALS.\nOne clinical trial in patients with ALS shows that administering N-acetyl cysteine 50 mg/kg daily for 12 months via subcutaneous injection does not improve survival or slow disease progression when compared with placebo (2254).\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to prevent or treat doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally does not seem to prevent or reverse doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity when compared with placebo or a control group (2252, 2253, 64712).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Intratracheal N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.\nClinical research in premature infants shows that intratracheal N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve symptoms, hasten recovery of chronic lung disease, or reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo (64460, 64490).\nless\nCannabis use disorder. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve abstinence rates in patients with cannabis use disorder.\nMost clinical research in adolescents and adults with cannabis use disorder shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg twice daily for 8-12 weeks as an adjunct to counseling and other interventions does not reduce symptoms of depression or help with cannabis abstinence (99531, 102663, 102666, 102668). Although a single study shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine more than doubles the odds of a negative urine cannabinoid test over an 8-week period in adolescents aged 15-21 when compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in the time to first negative urine cannabinoid test or end of treatment abstinence (102666).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Oral or inhaled N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nMost clinical research shows that taking oral or nebulized N-acetyl cysteine does not significantly improve lung function or lung capacity in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared with a control (22735, 64406, 64671, 64743). However, one preliminary clinical study shows that high-dose oral N-acetyl cysteine reduces the number and activity of airway neutrophils in these patients when compared with placebo (64510).\nless\nErythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve photosensitivity in patients with EPP.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1800 mg daily orally for 4 weeks does not improve photosensitivity in patients with EPP when compared with placebo or baseline (64448, 64756).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Adding oral N-acetyl cysteine to conventional Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication regimens does not seem to increase eradication rates.\nDespite conflicting findings from individual, small clinical studies (64497, 97042), meta-analyses of clinical research show that adding N-acetyl cysteine to a standard antibiotic eradication regimen does not improve eradication when compared with standard eradication therapy alone (99530, 106901). N-acetyl cysteine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg orally twice daily in combination with curcumin 30 mg, bovine lactoferrin 100 mg, and pantoprazole 20 mg, all taken twice daily for one week, without antibiotic therapy does not eradicate H. pylori infection, although it might improve dyspeptic symptoms and gastrointestinal inflammation (64559).\nless\nHepatitis. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not appear to improve treatment response in patients with hepatitis. However, when taken with interferon, it might lengthen the time to relapse.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally does not seem to benefit patients with acute viral hepatitis (64462). Also, adding N-acetyl cysteine to conventional interferon therapy does not seem to improve treatment response in patients with hepatitis C when compared with interferon therapy alone (64418, 64799, 64825). However, some clinical research shows that adding N-acetyl cysteine to interferon therapy delays relapse in hepatitis C patients when compared with interferon treatment alone (64424).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to increase CD4+ cell count in patients with HIV.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking N-acetyl cysteine 400 mg orally twice daily or 600 mg once daily for 4-6 months does not improve CD4+ cell counts or viral load in patients with HIV when compared with placebo (64482, 64779). In addition, taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg orally three times daily in combination with sodium selenite 500 mcg daily for up to 24 weeks does not affect the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes or viral load in HIV patients when compared with a control (64798).\nless\nHypotension. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve renal outcomes in patients with prolonged hypotension.\nOne clinical trial in patients with prolonged hypotension shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally for 7 days does not reduce the risk of acute kidney failure when compared with placebo (64545).\nless\nInfertility. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve fertility in females with unexplained infertility.\nOne clinical trial in females with unexplained infertility shows that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg daily in addition to clomiphene citrate 50 mg twice daily for 5 days, beginning on the second day of the cycle, does not improve pregnancy rate or reduce miscarriage rate when compared with clomiphene citrate alone (64528).\nless\nLiver transplant. Intravenous N-acetyl cysteine during liver donor operation does not seem to improve liver transplant outcomes. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne clinical trial shows that administering N-acetyl cysteine intravenously during a liver donor operation and preserving the liver in cold solution containing N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce the risk of ischemia reperfusion injury or acute cellular rejection in liver transplant recipients when compared with control (64486).\nless\nPancreatitis. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to prevent pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Additionally, intravenous N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to reduce the risk of organ dysfunction in patients being treated for severe acute pancreatitis.\nTwo clinical trials show that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg once before undergoing ERCP does not reduce the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis when compared with placebo (64522, 109939). One of these trials also evaluated oral N-acetyl cysteine in combination with rectal indomethacin, but the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis did not appear to be lower when compared with taking indomethacin alone. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between those groups (109939).\n\nIn patients with severe acute pancreatitis, intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, in combination with selenium and vitamin C, also does not seem to reduce the risk of organ dysfunction (64551).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Oral or intravenous N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve survival, prevent complications, or reduce length of hospital stay in patients undergoing cardiac or liver surgery.\nN-acetyl cysteine, taken orally or intravenously, does not seem to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, kidney injury, or mortality or reduce the length of hospital stay following cardiac surgery (64610, 64624, 64628, 64635, 91233, 91240). While some meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally or intravenously reduces the odds of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 36% to 44% when compared with placebo in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (64635, 91233, 91240), conflicting results exist (64624). In patients undergoing liver resection, intravenous N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce complication rate, risk of liver failure, length of hospital stay, or mortality when compared with a control group. In fact, patients receiving N-acetyl cysteine were more likely to experience delirium and its associated complications (99532).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nHead and neck cancer. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to reduce mortality, improve event-free survival, or prevent additional tumors in patients with head and neck cancer.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally does not prevent second primary tumors in patients with head and neck cancer (1710). Also, N-acetyl cysteine alone, or in combination with retinyl palmitate, has no effect on mortality or event-free survival in these patients (1710).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to reduce mortality, improve event-free survival, or prevent additional tumors in patients with lung cancer.\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine orally does not prevent second primary tumors in patients with lung cancer (1710). Also, N-acetyl cysteine alone, or in combination with retinyl palmitate, has no effect on mortality or event-free survival in these patients (1705, 1710).\nless\nMultisystem organ failure. Administering intravenous N-acetyl cysteine might increase the risk of mortality due to multisystem organ failure. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nAdministering N-acetyl cysteine intravenously, greater than 24 hours after hospital admission, might increase mortality rate due to multisystem organ failure. The effect of N-acetyl cysteine given within 24 hours of hospital admission requires further study (7871).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Research on the use of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine in patients with ARDS is conflicting. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nSome clinical research shows that N-acetyl cysteine might reduce mortality and improve oxygenation in patients with acute lung injury/ARDS when compared with a control (64619). These patients were administered intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 150 mg/kg on the first day followed by 50 mg/kg for 3 more days. However, other clinical research shows that administering intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 40 mg/kg daily for 3 days does not reduce the risk of ARDS development in patients with acute lung injury (64771). Also, some clinical research shows that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine for up to 6 days does not reduce the time for improvement in patients with ARDS (64492). These discrepancies may be due to variations in genes involved in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) expression (64619).\nless\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). It is unclear if oral or intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with ALD.\nA case series of three male children with this rare condition suggests that administering N-acetyl cysteine orally and intravenously might improve overall survival and stabilize neurologic status after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation when compared with historical controls (64547).\nless\nAging. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking a combination product containing N-acetyl cysteine 100 mg/kg, glycerine 100 mg/kg, and alanine 200 mg/kg orally daily for 16 weeks modestly improved waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and some serum markers of oxidative stress, but not body-mass index or diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo (110624). It is unclear if this effect is due to N-acetyl cysteine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAlcohol use disorder. It is unclear whether oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for alcohol use disorder.\nA very small clinical study in adults with alcohol use disorder shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg daily with topiramate 200 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce alcohol consumption or the incidence of topiramate-related cognitive impairment when compared with placebo plus topiramate (113421).\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for preventing alcohol-related liver damage, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this condition.\nAltitude sickness. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine can treat or prevent altitude sickness.\nOne very small clinical trial shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 400 mg daily does not reduce altitude-associated anorexia or improve food intake in individuals exposed to high altitudes when compared with either placebo or vitamin E 400 mg daily (64599).\nless\nAluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in people with aluminum phosphide poisoning.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small, mostly low-quality clinical studies in patients with aluminum phosphide poisoning suggests that administering intravenous N-acetyl cysteine reduces the odds of mortality when compared with control (111892).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for Alzheimer disease.\nOne clinical trial in a small number of patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 50 mg/kg daily for 6 months does not improve most cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer disease when compared with placebo (7870). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease also shows that taking a combination product containing N-acetyl cysteine 2.55 grams, L-serine 12.35 grams, nicotinamide riboside 1 gram, and L-carnitine tartrate 3.73 grams orally once daily for 28 days followed by twice daily for 56 more days improves cognitive functioning scores by 14% to 29% when compared with placebo (110623). It is unclear if this effect is due to N-acetyl cysteine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAminoglycoside ototoxicity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral N-acetyl cysteine may modestly reduce the risk of ototoxicity caused by aminoglycoside therapy.\nA meta-analysis of available clinical research in adults with kidney failure receiving aminoglycosides for bloodstream infections shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days, or for up to 7 days after completion of aminoglycoside therapy, reduces the risk of hearing loss by 33% when compared with placebo. The findings of this analysis are limited by the small sample sizes and high risk of bias of the included studies (97049).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if inhaling N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with asthma.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that, when administered as an aerosol daily for one week in combination with isoproterenol, N-acetyl cysteine 10% improves lung capacity and decreases sputum viscosity when compared with placebo in patients with asthma (64674).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine can improve athletic performance.\nSome small clinical studies shows that N-acetyl cysteine might be beneficial if taken orally at a dose of 1200 mg daily for 9 days leading up to exercise or when administered intravenously both before and during exercise (64529, 91248), but that it might not improve performance when taken as a single 20 mg/kg oral dose 60 minutes prior to exercise (102028).\nless\nBack pain. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for back pain.\nA small clinical study in adults with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disc herniation shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily as an adjunctive treatment to naproxen 500 mg twice daily modestly reduces pain and pain-related disability when compared with placebo at 8 weeks, but not at earlier time points (113081).\nless\nBiliary disorders. It is unclear if intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with biliary disorders. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing surgical bypass for obstructive jaundice shows that postoperative intravenous N-acetyl cysteine for 48 hours reduces levels of some liver enzymes, but not bilirubin levels or mean hospital stay, when compared with a control group. Although all liver enzyme levels had not returned to normal by 30 days after surgery, they were more improved in the group using N-acetylcysteine (102654).\nless\nBipolar disorder. The effects of oral N-acetyl cysteine in patients with bipolar disorder are conflicting. Oral N-acetyl cysteine might reduce symptoms of depression and increase remission rates, but it does not appear to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of mania or for maintaining remission.\nOne clinical study in patients with bipolar disorder shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1000 mg twice daily as adjunct to usual therapy for 24 weeks reduces symptoms of depression when compared with placebo (64608). A subgroup analysis of patients from this study who were diagnosed with bipolar II disorder shows that this dose of N-acetyl cysteine can increase the number of patients who achieve remission of both depression and mania, but not the number achieving remission of only one of these, when compared with placebo (91243). However, other research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 3 grams daily in addition to standard therapy for 20 weeks does not improve depression when compared with placebo in patients with bipolar depression experiencing a depressive episode for at least 4 weeks. A limitation of this study is the high (56%) placebo response rate, which might have limited the ability to detect between-group differences in symptoms improvements (99529).\n\nTaking N-acetyl cysteine as an adjunct to usual therapy does not appear to be beneficial for maintaining remission. A clinical study in patients with bipolar disorder shows that, although taking N-acetyl cysteine 1000 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms of bipolar disorder when compared to baseline, maintenance therapy with N-acetyl cysteine for an additional 6 months does not improve depression symptoms or prevent recurrence when compared with placebo (91234).\nless\nBronchiectasis. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has been evaluated in patients with bronchiectasis, with promising results.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese adults with bronchiectasis shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for 12 months reduces the risk of exacerbation by 59% when compared with a control group receiving on-demand treatment only. For every eight patients treated with N-acetyl cysteine, one additional patient was free of exacerbations at 12 months when compared with on-demand treatment only (102027).\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with N-acetyl cysteine solution is beneficial in patients with canker sores.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with recurrent canker sores shows that rinsing the mouth with N-acetyl cysteine (ACC, HEXAL AG) 200 mg dissolved in water for 30 seconds is no more effective than 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate for canker sore healing time or level of pain. However, pain was reduced by 50% to 90% more over baseline 2-4 days after use of N-acetyl cysteine when compared with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (102659).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nSome observational research in children aged 2-17 years with chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity has found that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 3 mcg/kg over 24 hours is associated with day-to-day improvement in liver injury, based on liver function enzyme levels, when compared with no N-acetyl cysteine therapy. Decreases in liver enzymes also occurred earlier in patients using N-acetyl cysteine (102664).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral N-acetyl cysteine may reduce the risk for peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving oxaliplatin.\nOne preliminary clinical study in patients with colon cancer shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg orally at 1.5 hours prior to oxaliplatin therapy reduces the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy when compared with placebo (64505). Another small clinical trial in patients with gastric or colorectal cancers shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine (Osveh Pharmaceutical Company) 1200 mg one hour before receiving oxaliplatin during eight courses of chemotherapy reduces the incidence and severity of neurotoxicity symptoms when compared with placebo. In patients taking N-acetyl cysteine, 31% had no signs of neurotoxicity after oxaliplatin chemotherapy, compared with 0% of those taking placebo. Also, 44% had mild symptoms, compared with 6% of those taking placebo. However, there were no significant differences in electrophysiological sensory results (102665).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve kidney function in patients with CKD or reduce the risk of kidney injury or other complications after cardiac surgery in patients with CKD. However, intravenous N-acetyl cysteine might offer some benefit in patients with CKD undergoing cardiac surgery.\nClinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg orally daily in combination with standard antihypertensive drugs does not reduce proteinuria or other markers of kidney injury in patients with CKD (64627).\n\nN-acetyl cysteine has also been evaluated for the prevention of acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery in patients with CKD, with conflicting results. Several meta-analyses have shown that N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury, postoperative complications, postoperative interventions, length of hospitalization, or mortality after cardiac surgery in adults with CKD (95766, 95767, 95768). However, these meta-analyses found that intravenous, but not oral, N-acetyl cysteine might be beneficial (95767, 95768). A more recent meta-analysis shows that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine reduces the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury by 23% and reduces the risk of cardiac adverse events by 17% (99533). However, most of the studies included in this latter meta-analysis were small and the definition of cardiac events varied among the included studies. Higher quality research is needed to determine the benefit, if any, of N-acetyl cysteine in reducing acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery in patients with CKD.\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is effective for reducing cravings or withdrawal symptoms in people trying to stop cocaine use.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for 2 days reduces the desire to use cocaine when compared with placebo in individuals with cocaine dependence (64563). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for 2 days does not reduce cravings or withdrawal symptoms when compared with placebo in patients hospitalized for cocaine dependency (64504).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is effective for preventing colorectal cancer.\nClinical research in a small group of patients with a history of adenomatous colonic polyps shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 800 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces the proliferative index of colonic crypts, suggesting that N-acetyl cysteine might decrease the likelihood of colorectal cancer (7873).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral or intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients undergoing CABG surgery.\nA small clinical study shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 300 mg orally in addition to intermittent blood cardioplegia does not affect postoperative outcomes or the risk of mortality when compared with control in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery (64638). Another small clinical study shows that giving N-acetyl cysteine 100 mg/kg by intravenous infusion, for two doses during CABG surgery and one postoperative dose, seems to reduce serum creatinine levels at 4 and 48 hours after surgery and reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury when compared with placebo. However, serum creatinine levels were within the normal range in all patients (106886).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Small clinical trials suggest that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is not beneficial in patients at risk for respiratory failure from severe COVID-19. It is unclear if oral use is beneficial.\nA small single-center clinical trial of patients presenting to the emergency room with COVID-19 pneumonia in Brazil shows that receiving intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 21 grams in dextrose 5% over 20 hours in conjunction with institutional standard care, including empiric antibiotics, does not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or mortality when compared with dextrose 5% (105560). Another small single-center clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Iran shows that receiving a continuous intravenous infusion of N-acetyl cysteine 40 mg/kg in dextrose 5% daily for 3 days in conjunction with institutional standard care, including corticosteroids, vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc, also does not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, or mortality when compared with dextrose 5% (105561). Similarly, a retrospective study of patients hospitalized in Italy for COVID-19 pneumonia shows that receiving intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 300 mg three times daily, switched to 600 mg twice daily if the patient was clinically stable, for a duration of least 5 days, does not improve inpatient mortality, ICU admission, length of ICU stay, or the incidence of atelectasis, when compared with no supplementation. At a 6-month follow-up, treatment with N-acetyl cysteine also did not appear to impact long-term outcomes in these patients (108449).\n\nIn contrast, a small, retrospective study in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia shows that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine, 600 mg twice daily for 10 days in addition to standard care, including empiric antibiotics, corticosteroids, and remdesivir, reduces the risk for severe respiratory failure requiring ventilator support and reduces mortality at 14 days in those with severe pneumonia when compared with standard care alone (106885). Prospective, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if mouthwash solutions containing N-acetyl cysteine can reduce dental plaque; higher concentrations may be more effective than lower concentrations.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a mouthwash solution containing N-acetyl cysteine 10% four times daily for 7 days reduces dental plaque (64687). However, other clinical research shows that rinsing twice daily for 3 weeks with N-acetyl cysteine 1.25% does not reduce the development of plaque. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine 1.25% was not beneficial when used for 2 weeks as a treatment for experimental plaque (102662).\nless\nDry eye. Small clinical studies suggest that eye drops containing N-acetyl cysteine, with or without chitosan, might improve objective measures of dry eye.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with dry eye shows that using tear solution containing 20% N-acetyl cysteine every two hours for 2 months improves objective, but not subjective, symptoms of dry eye syndrome when compared with artificial tears (64705). A small clinical study in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease shows that applying a specific product (Lacrimera) containing chitosan-N-acetyl cysteine as one drop once or twice daily improves tear film thickness (TFT) after 10 minutes of application, and is maintained for 24 hours, when compared with placebo. Once or twice daily application does not seem to alter the level of benefit (97710). It is unclear if the benefit of this combination product is due to N-acetyl cysteine, chitosan, or the combination.\nless\nEndometriosis. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain shows that taking a combination product containing N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg, alpha lipoic acid 400 mg, bromelain 50 mg, and zinc 20 mg daily for 6 months improves pain and reduces analgesic intake when compared to baseline (99535). This study was limited by a lack of comparator group.\nless\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). It is unclear if N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can improve visualization when used as a premedication for EGD.\nClinical research shows that giving NAC orally, 600 mg in 90 mL of an emulsion formulation, 20 minutes prior to EGD reduces foaming and mucus, allowing better visualization of the mucosa. The percentage of patients with no bubbles affecting visualization is about 51% with NAC, compared with 34% with placebo. The percentage not requiring suction or endoscopic flushes is 50% with NAC and 27% with placebo. Giving simethicone 150 mg in combination with NAC further improves visualization (108941).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is effective for preventing or treating exercise-induced muscle damage.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 20 mg/kg daily in three divided doses after muscle-damaging exercise does not improve muscle repair or inflammatory response in healthy patients taking part in a specific resistance training program (91244).\nless\nFibrocystic breast disease. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is effective for fibrocystic beast disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in adult females with fibrocystic breast disease and cyclical mastalgia shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine (Osvah Pharmaceutical Company) 600 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks modestly improves pain scores when compared with placebo (109938).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if mouthwash containing N-acetyl cysteine is effective for the prevention or treatment of gingivitis.\nClinical research shows that rinsing twice daily for 3 weeks with N-acetyl cysteine 1.25% is slightly more effective than placebo for reducing the development of gingivitis. However, there was no effect on plaque. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine is not as effective as chlorhexidine 0.2% and had no benefit when used for 2 weeks as a treatment for experimental gingivitis (102662).\nless\nHangover. Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for treating hangovers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is effective for preventing or treating hearing loss.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 900-2700 mg orally daily for up to 42 days modestly protects against noise-induced hearing loss in middle to high hearing thresholds (0 to 4 kHz and 0 to 6 kHz), but not low hearing thresholds (0 to 2 kHz), when compared with control. However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity (109937). Another meta-analysis of 2 clinical trials in adults with sudden hearing loss shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg orally daily for 2 weeks to 3 months moderately improves pure tone threshold hearing when compared with control (109940).\nless\nHepatorenal syndrome. It is unclear if intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nA case series of 12 patients with hepatorenal syndrome reported that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, starting with a 150 mg/kg loading dose over 2 hours, followed by a continuous infusion of 100 mg/kg daily for 5 days, modestly improved kidney function, but not liver function or blood pressure. When compared with historical controls, N-acetyl cysteine administration was also associated with an improvement in total survival time (1752). Prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with HHT.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg three times daily orally for 12 weeks decreases the frequency and severity of daytime nosebleeds, but not nighttime nosebleeds, when compared to baseline in individuals with HHT (64643). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonia. It is unclear if oral or inhaled N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for the management of various forms of interstitial pneumonia.\nA very small clinical study in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg three times daily for 12 weeks seems to improve pulmonary function tests and decrease biochemical markers of disease when compared with baseline (7868). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a specific type of interstitial pneumonia, shows that oral or inhaled N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce the risk of acute exacerbations or attenuate decline of lung function as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), when compared with placebo (99538).\nless\nLead toxicity. Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for lead toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nMalaria. It is unclear if intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial as an adjunct in treating malaria. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne small clinical study shows that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine, in combination with intravenous artesunate, does not reduce symptoms or the risk of mortality in patients with severe malaria when compared with artesunate alone (64630).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear of oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for male infertility.\nClinical research in adults with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg orally daily for 26 weeks improves sperm concentration, but not sperm motility, when compared with placebo (64626). Additionally, a preliminary clinical study in adults with asthenoteratozoospermia shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg daily for 3 months improves sperm motility and concentration, increases protamine, and improves hormone levels and sperm morphology when compared to baseline (99534). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nThere is also interest in using N-acetyl cysteine to attenuate the infertility effects observed after COVID-19 infection. A large clinical study in males who had normal sperm analysis prior to COVID-19, but with significantly lower sperm parameters within 6 weeks after infection, shows that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg daily for 3 months improves sperm volume, concentration, morphology, and total motility when compared with baseline post-COVID-19 levels (108447). Although the study enrolled a control group, the investigators did not provide a statistical comparison of outcomes between groups, limiting the validity of this finding.\nless\nMercury toxicity. Although there has been interest in using oral N-acetyl cysteine for mercury toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nMiscarriage. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its benefit when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg daily with folic acid 500 mcg daily improves the likelihood of maintaining pregnancy past 20 weeks when compared with folic acid alone in adults with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (64616).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral and intravenous N-acetyl cysteine are beneficial in patients with MS.\nOne clinical trial in a small group of patients with MS shows that intravenous and oral N-acetyl cysteine in addition to standard care for 2 months improves self-reported cognition by a moderate amount when compared with standard care alone. Self-reported attention also seems to improve (102657).\nless\nNitrate tolerance. Intravenous N-acetyl cysteine seems to reduce the development of nitrate tolerance. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has shown mixed results for this use.\nSome clinical research shows that concurrent intravenous or oral administration of N-acetyl cysteine reduces the development of nitroglycerin tolerance (832, 2245, 64546). However, other research suggests that oral N-acetyl cysteine does not reduce the development of nitroglycerin tolerance in patients with angina (2281, 2282).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with NASH.\nOne small clinical study in patients with NASH shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1.2 grams with metformin 850-1500 mg daily for 48 weeks reduces NASH activity scores and measures of steatosis and hepatocellular ballooning, but not inflammation or fibrosis, when compared to baseline. However, taking the same dose of N-acetyl cysteine and metformin along with ursodeoxycholic acid 15 mg/kg daily does not improve these outcomes, or improve liver enzyme levels, when compared with baseline (102026). The reasons for these disparate findings are unclear. Inadequate statistical power and the lack of a comparator group limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Oral N-acetyl cysteine might improve some symptoms of OCD when used with fluvoxamine in adults. Its effects when used in combination with other psychiatric medications or as monotherapy in children and adults is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1000 mg twice daily along with fluvoxamine 200 mg daily for 10 weeks modestly reduces overall symptoms of OCD and symptoms of obsession when compared with fluvoxamine alone. However, the addition of N-acetyl cysteine is not associated with an improvement in symptoms of compulsion, nor with a statistically significant increase in partial or complete responders, when compared with fluvoxamine alone (97048).\n\nA clinical trial in adults with OCD who are taking various psychiatric medications shows that adding oral N-acetyl cysteine 2000-4000 mg daily for 20 weeks does not reduce symptoms of OCD, or improve secondary outcomes such as anxiety, mood, functioning, or quality of life, when compared with placebo (108450). Over half (63%) of patients had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, limiting the applicability of these findings. Other preliminary clinical research in adults with moderate to severe OCD who are taking various psychiatric medications shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 3000 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve OCD symptoms when compared with placebo (97045).\n\nA very small preliminary clinical trial in children aged 8-17 years, most of whom are not taking psychiatric medications, shows some benefit for symptom reduction when N-acetyl cysteine 2700 mg daily for 12 weeks is compared with placebo (102656).\nless\nOtitis media. Although there has been interest in using ear drops containing N-acetyl cysteine for otitis media, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of N-acetyl cysteine for this purpose.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral N-acetyl cysteine might improve pregnancy-related outcomes in PCOS, although it appears to be less effective than metformin. Evidence on its benefits for other symptoms of PCOS is conflicting.\nSome research in patients with PCOS shows that N-acetyl cysteine can increase insulin sensitivity, improve hirsutism, and improve menstrual irregularity (64435, 64550, 91245, 102121). It may also improve fasting insulin levels, but results are conflicting (64435, 64550, 91245). Other research shows that N-acetyl cysteine, alone or as a specific combination product (Ovaric HP, Just Pharma), increases ovulation rates in some, but not all, patients with PCOS (64480, 64550, 64553, 91246, 91247, 102121).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine increases the odds of having a live birth, getting pregnant, and/or ovulating by about 3-fold when compared with placebo. Its effects on the odds of pregnancy and ovulation appear to be greater in those resistant to clomiphene citrate. However, when compared with metformin, N-acetyl cysteine appears to decrease the odds of getting pregnant by about 60% and decrease the odds of ovulation by about 87%. N-acetyl cysteine also does not appear to reduce the rate of miscarriage, menstrual irregularity, or the severity of acne or hirsutism in people with PCOS (93057). Another meta-analysis shows that N-acetyl cysteine in various doses is associated with an insignificant improvement in ovulation and pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, and miscarriage rate, and is less efficacious than metformin for all of these outcomes (106888).\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for preventing postmenopausal bone loss.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 2 grams daily for 3 months does not reduce postmenopausal bone loss when compared with placebo (64576).\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in veterans with PTSD.\nA small clinical study in veterans with PTSD and a history of substance use disorders shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks while receiving cognitive behavioral therapy reduces depressive symptoms and the rate of self-reported PTSD symptoms when compared with cognitive behavioral therapy plus placebo. Additionally, receiving N-acetyl cysteine reduces the amount and frequency of cravings by 81% and 72%, respectively, compared to a reduction of 32% and 29% for those receiving cognitive behavioral therapy with placebo. The use of N-acetyl cysteine did not impact the intensity of cravings or the actual rate of substance use during the study, which was low for all patients (97037).\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for reducing the risk for preterm labor.\nSome clinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 0.6 grams daily orally in combination with 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), beginning at 16 to 18 weeks gestation and continuing until active labor, increases the likelihood of reaching 36 weeks gestation and increases gestational age at delivery in adults with previous preterm labor and bacterial vaginosis when compared with 17-OHPC alone (64615). However, taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 0.6 grams every 8 hours, beginning at 25 to 33 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery, does not improve the treatment-to-delivery interval when compared with placebo in adults with early onset severe pre-eclampsia and/or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome (64493).\nless\nRadiation-induced sialadenitis. It is unclear if mouthwash containing N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial for reducing dry mouth during chemoradiotherapy.\nOne clinical trial in a small group of patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that using a mouth rinse containing N-acetyl cysteine 500 mg five times daily during radiotherapy and 2 weeks postradiotherapy improves daytime and total sticky saliva and feelings of dry mouth by up to 38% when compared with placebo. However, N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to improve nighttime symptoms (102661).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral N-acetyl cysteine seems to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The benefits of N-acetyl cysteine on positive symptoms of schizophrenia are less clear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine for at least 6 months has a small to moderate effect on negative symptoms when compared with placebo. However, taking N-acetyl cysteine for only 8 weeks does not reduce negative symptoms, suggesting that a longer duration of treatment may be necessary (102658). Individual clinical studies show that N-acetyl cysteine does not improve positive symptoms, social function, cognition, and clinical global impression when compared with placebo (64605, 99528). However, a meta-analysis of available research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine for any duration has a small effect on positive symptoms, a moderate effect on working memory, and a large effect on overall symptoms (102658). It is possible that many individual studies were underpowered to detect a difference.\nless\nSepsis. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine may improve respiratory function and tissue oxygenation, but not mortality, in patients with septic shock.\nTwo small clinical studies show that intravenous N-acetyl cysteine might improve respiratory function and tissue oxygenation, but not mortality, in some patients with recently diagnosed septic shock when compared with placebo (64760, 64797).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. Small clinical studies suggest that oral N-acetyl cysteine may improve ocular and oral manifestations of this condition.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with Sjogren syndrome show that taking oral N-acetyl cysteine 200 mg three times daily for 4 weeks reduces eye soreness and irritability, bad breath, and daytime thirst when compared with a control group; however, objective signs of dry eye were not improved (64673, 64812).\nless\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous acetylcysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage shows that administering intravenous acetylcysteine 1000 and selenium 800 mcg mg twice daily starting within 24 hours of admission for 14 days but does not improve neurological outcomes (i.e., level of disability at 30 days as assessed by modified Rankin scale) or radiological outcomes (e.g., hematoma volume, hydrocephalus, vasospasm) when compared with placebo (113644).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with SLE.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally 2.4-4.8 grams daily for 3 months significantly reduces disease activity and fatigue when compared with placebo in patients with SLE (91242).\nless\nThrombocytopenia. Oral N-acetyl cysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia resistant or refractory to steroid therapy shows taking N-acetyl cysteine 400 mg every 8 hours with atorvastatin daily for at least one month at least doubles platelet count or increases it above 30 × 109/L compared to baseline in 60% of participants. However, 40% of participants did not respond to treatment (111572). It is unclear if this effect is due to N-acetyl cysteine, atorvastatin, or the combination. The validity of these findings is limited by the very small sample size, insufficient randomization, lack of a comparator group, and low retention rate, especially in the non-responder group.\nless\nTourette syndrome. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nOne small clinical trial in children 8-17 years of age with Tourette syndrome shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by 1200 mg twice daily for the next 10 weeks, does not improve tic symptoms, premonitory urges, or the comorbid symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression when compared with placebo (97040).\nless\nTrichotillomania. Oral N-acetyl cysteine might offer some benefit to adults, but not children, with trichotillomania.\nOne small clinical trial in adults shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine orally, in doses up to 2400 mg daily, significantly decreases the urge to pull hair, the amount of hair pulled, and patients' perception of their control over hair pulling as measured by a self-rating scale. After 12 weeks of treatment, scores decreased by 40% (16840). However, in children, taking N-acetyl cysteine in doses up to 2400 mg daily for 12 weeks does not seem to improve hair pulling when compared with placebo (91235).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nOne small clinical trial shows that oral N-acetyl cysteine 0.8 grams daily in combination with mesalamine 2.4 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve the rate of clinical remission in individuals with ulcerative colitis when compared with mesalamine alone (64606).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral N-acetyl cysteine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research in female breast cancer survivors has found that taking the combination of D-mannose 500 mg, N-acetyl cysteine 100 mg, and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract 200 mg daily for 2 months in addition to antibiotic therapy is associated with reduced recurrence of UTIs and urinary discomfort when compared with antibiotics alone (97360).\nless\nUterine fibroids. It is unclear if oral N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients with uterine fibroids.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces the volume of uterine fibroids by about 25%, compared with a reduction of about 1% with placebo. N-acetyl cysteine also reduces painful and heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with placebo (106889).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if postoperative intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is beneficial in patients undergoing lower extremity amputation.\nA clinical study in patients undergoing lower extremity amputation due to critical limb-threatening ischemia shows that receiving postoperative intravenous N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg twice daily for 5 days, beginning within 3 hours after surgery, improves tissue perfusion from days 3 to 5 and amputation stump healing at day 30 in patients that are defined as high-risk, but not in the intent-to-treat population, when compared with placebo (108448). The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment and the inclusion of both above-the-knee and below-the-knee amputations.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate N-acetyl cysteine for these uses.",

Conversely, although clinical research suggests that although activated charcoal can reduce the absorption of N-acetyl cysteine by up to 40%, it does not seem to reduce its clinical effects (1755, 22774, 22775, 64501, 64647).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAccidental overdose has been reported in patients receiving intravenous N-acetyl cysteine. In most cases the dose given was 10 times the recommended dose. In other cases, the infusion was administered too rapidly or a subsequent dose was given too close in time to the previous infusion. Adverse events associated with these overdoses included hypotension and kidney failure. Death has also been reported after intravenous N-acetyl cysteine overdose; however, it is unclear whether the deaths were due to N-acetyl cysteine or to an acetaminophen overdose for which the N-acetyl cysteine was indicated (64711).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with N-acetyl cysteine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe bioavailability of oral N-acetyl cysteine is low, ranging from 4% to 10% (64655, 64678, 64684). The low bioavailability may be attributed to deacetylation of N-acetyl cysteine in the intestinal mucosa and lumen (64655). In pharmacokinetic research, the area under the curve (AUC) in humans after a single oral 600 mg N-acetyl cysteine dose was 32.87 mcM/L, while the Tmax was about 0.7-1 hour for both 200 mg and 600 mg doses (64660, 106887). Other research suggests that the Tmax is closer to 1.5 hours (64660). In patients receiving standard intravenous N-acetyl cysteine treatment for acetaminophen poisoning, the average plasma concentration of N-acetyl cysteine was 554 mg/L after the initial loading dose (150 mg/kg over 15 minutes). At steady-state, an N-acetyl cysteine level of 35 mg/L was maintained after 12 hours, and the AUC was 1748 mg/hr/L (64656). The AUC of N-acetyl cysteine is elevated in patients with cirrhosis (64788).\nDistribution\nAssessing the pharmacokinetics of N-acetyl cysteine is difficult because it binds to cysteine and other sulfhydryl molecules. Because these compounds are widely available in tissues, N-acetyl cysteine is rapidly removed from plasma (10268). N-acetyl cysteine is highly protein-bound (64729, 64647). Some pharmacokinetic research shows that oral N-acetyl cysteine is approximately 50-64% protein-bound (64723, 64647), with a volume of distribution of 0.33-0.59 L/kg (64647, 64678, 64684). At high concentrations, oral N-acetyl cysteine remains active in the human lung for approximately five hours (64723).\nMetabolism\nAnimal research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine is rapidly metabolized to disulfides via deacetylation and oxidation (64725).\nExcretion\nThe plasma clearance of N-acetyl cysteine was found to be 0.84 L/hr/kg after a 400 mg oral dose and 0.11 L/hr/kg after a 200 mg intravenous dose (64678). After intravenous treatment for acetaminophen poisoning, total clearance of N-acetyl cysteine was 3.18 mL/min/kg in one study (64656). N-acetyl cysteine has a renal clearance of approximately 30% (64684, 64647). In other research, the fraction of an oral dose of 600 mg excreted in the urine in 36 hours is 3.7% (106887). The major excretory product of N-acetyl cysteine appears to be sulfate (64647). The half-life of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine has been reported to be less than 30 minutes in some pharmacokinetic research (64817). The terminal half-life of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine is around 5.6-5.7 hours while the terminal half-life of oral N-acetyl cysteine is around 6.25 hours both oral and intravenous N-acetyl cysteine range from 5.6-6.25 hours (64647, 64656, 64678). In other research, the half-life of oral N-acetyl cysteine after taking 600 mg orally twice daily for 3 days is 15.4 hours in Chinese individuals and 18.7 hours in Caucasians (106887). Patients with cirrhosis appear to have a slower plasma clearance and prolonged half-life (64788).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nN-acetyl cysteine is the N-acetyl derivative of the amino acid L-cysteine (1705). N-acetyl cysteine is a precursor of glutathione, which is a potent antioxidant. Glutathione cannot cross the cell membrane, but N-acetyl cysteine easily crosses the cell membrane where it is converted to cysteine and, subsequently, glutathione. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl-free radicals reduce intracellular and extracellular concentrations of glutathione. N-acetyl cysteine is a very efficient way to replenish glutathione and reduce damage caused by ROS (1761, 7874).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nN-acetyl cysteine appears to reduce cellular production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) (1763). Some in vitro research shows that N-acetyl cysteine inhibits markers of inflammation, such as phospholipid metabolism, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and protease activity (64442). Although the mechanism has not yet been elucidated, some in vitro research suggests that nitric oxide synthesis may explain some of the anti-inflammatory effects of N-acetyl cysteine (64469). Preliminary clinical research in adult females with fibrocystic breast disease shows that taking N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks modestly lowers markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, when compared with placebo (109938).\n\nIn isolated neutrophils and monocytes, N-acetyl cysteine inhibited chemotaxis (64679), release of elastase, respiratory burst, and NF-kappaB activation (64499). However, when given orally, N-acetyl cysteine resulted in reduction of neutrophil activity and respiratory burst, but not chemotaxis (64677, 64499). Control of redox-sensitive transcription factors by N-acetyl cysteine may play a role in its anti-inflammatory effects (64527). Also, intraoperative N-acetyl cysteine administration during liver transplantation increased plasma IL-4 and IL-10 (64620).\nAntibacterial effects\nN-acetyl cysteine cleaves the disulfide bonds of mucus glycoproteins, destabilizing biofilms. This could theoretically allow antibiotics to more easily reach bacteria that produce biofilms (106901).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine has anticancer effects (64421, 64425, 64431, 64432, 64683, 64769, 64816). While the anticancer mechanism has not been determined, results from some in vitro and animal research suggest that N-acetyl cysteine inhibits the invasive activity and angiogenesis of tumor cells (1767). Additional animal models suggest that N-acetyl cysteine may promote anti-angiogenesis through angiostatin production, which promotes vascular collapse of the tumor (64470). Other animal research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine's antitumor activity is related to changes in TNF-alpha and TNF receptor processing (64787). Some in vitro research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine may inhibit the growth of hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines via anti-NF-kappaB activity (64431). Other in vitro research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine's anticancer effects may be explained by enhanced adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to tumor cells (64747) or via inhibition of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production (64414).\nAnticoagulant effects\nPreliminary evidence indicates that N-acetyl cysteine can impair platelet aggregation (64511, 64644). N-acetyl cysteine appears to increase synthesis of nitric oxide, a potent inhibitor of platelet function (10272).\nAntidote effects (acetaminophen toxicity)\nN-acetyl cysteine is effective for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity because it restores glutathione levels in the liver and acts as an alternative substrate for conjugation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites (15). The mechanism of the protective action of N-acetyl cysteine against the toxicity of acetaminophen has been suggested to involve the inhibition of the O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome P-448) (64691).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of N-acetyl cysteine may explain its apparent ability to prevent adverse effects caused by toxic chemicals, drug reactions, and nonionic low-osmolality contrast agents (1762, 6611). The antioxidant and free radical properties might also make N-acetyl cysteine useful in the treatment of pulmonary and cardiac disease (1705, 1765). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, N-acetyl cysteine administration counteracted the oxidative stress associated with oxygen administration; namely, it prevented the oxidization of erythrocyte GSH and protein (64495). After N-acetyl cysteine treatment of humans, there was a decrease in the production of superoxide anions by stimulated neutrophils (64793). In humans undergoing knee surgery, low-dose N-acetyl cysteine infusion resulted in significantly lower plasma, but not tissue, malondialdehyde (MDA; a marker of oxidative stress) levels upon reperfusion (64485). N-acetyl cysteine did not have an effect on MDA levels in COPD patients treated for 15 days (64609). Some in vitro research showed that N-acetyl cysteine prevented oxidative stress-induced suppression of IL-2 biosynthesis (64416). Other in vitro research showed that N-acetyl cysteine protected A431 epithelial cells against oxidative stress induced by quinine menadione (64751).\nAntisepsis effects\nSome animal research suggests that IV N-acetyl cysteine may improve some markers of sepsis. Dogs with E. coli-induced sepsis were treated with N-acetyl cysteine 150 mg/kg followed by a 20 mg/kg per hour infusion. Compared to a control, dogs receiving N-acetyl cysteine maintained a higher cardiac index, oxygen delivery, and left ventricular stroke work index and had lower systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (64768). In additional animal research, dogs receiving the same dose of IV N-acetyl cysteine showed improved oxygen availability and decreased TNF release when compared with placebo after exposure to E. coli endotoxin (64757).\nAntiviral effects\nIn patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, N-acetyl cysteine can increase levels of glutathione. Increased concentration of glutathione seems to reduce oxidative stress associated with HIV disease and to improve the number and activity of CD4 T-lymphocytes (1539). Despite this, most clinical research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine does not provide additional benefit to HIV patients (64482, 64779, 64798). Additionally, some in vitro research shows that N-acetyl cysteine might actually enhance growth of HIV in certain cell types. The mechanism of this activity is unclear (64783).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine's antioxidant effects might inhibit LDL oxidation, slow the progression of atherosclerotic lesions, and increase expression of nitric oxide synthase in vascular smooth muscle cells (64409, 64602, 64800). However, preliminary clinical evidence shows that N-acetyl cysteine 1200-2400 mg daily does not improve oxidized LDL or serum lipids in healthy adults (64465). There is some interest in using N-acetyl cysteine to protect the heart after myocardial infarction. In clinical research, continuous infusion of N-acetyl cysteine in conjunction with nitroglycerin reduces myocardial infarct size and increases myocardial salvage in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a myocardial infarction. The extent of myocardial salvage was directly correlated with increased myeloperoxidase levels and reduced malondialdehyde levels. N-acetyl cysteine administration was also associated with a 42% reduction in median creatine kinase levels (97044).\nCystic fibrosis effects\nWhile N-acetyl cysteine does not seem to benefit cystic fibrosis patients in clinical research, some evidence suggests that N-acetyl cysteine may have a role in this disease. In vitro research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine may induce electrolyte secretion from airway epithelial cells (64774). Additionally, in children, some evidence suggests that N-acetyl cysteine improves electrolyte transport across the epithelia via osmotic effects or alteration of certain factors which influence this transport (64447).\nDental effects\nSome early clinical research shows that using a mouthwash solution containing N-acetyl cysteine reduces dental plaque or gingivitis (64687, 102662). N-acetyl cysteine might reduce bacterial growth, including oral pathogenic bacteria, by breaking the disulfide bonds of bacterial proteins. N-acetyl cysteine may also inhibit bacterial adherence (102662).\nExercise performance enhancement\nIn human research, N-acetyl cysteine appears to increase exercise performance by reducing respiratory muscle fatigue (64618). The exercise benefits of N-acetyl cysteine are also purportedly due to its antioxidant effects (64595, 64584, 91248). N-acetyl cysteine also seems to improve potassium regulation, which plays a role in reducing fatigue (64529).\nHeavy metal toxicity protective effects\nSome animal research shows that N-acetyl cysteine acts as a chelating agent for certain heavy metals, including potassium dichromate, boric acid, and mercuric chloride (36849, 64519). N-acetyl cysteine does not appear to be effective in the treatment of lead tetraacetate or cadmium intoxication (36849, 64428). Some animal research also suggests that N-acetyl cysteine may protect embryos from the toxic effects of methyl mercuric chloride (64772). However, other animal research indicates that N-acetyl cysteine might actually increase the risk for teratogenic effects from mercury, chromium, and cadmium (64666). The mechanism for these differing results is unclear.\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, N-acetyl cysteine appears to improve disease activity by blocking mTOR in T lymphocytes (91242). N-acetyl cysteine increased the number of CD4+ cells in patients with suboptimal glutathione levels (64758). In cells isolated from healthy adults and HIV patients, N-acetyl cysteine enhanced the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of neutrophils and mononuclear cells and partially reversed the antineoplastic drug 1,3 bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)-induced inhibition of neutrophils (64749). After N-acetyl cysteine treatment of humans, there was an improvement in neutrophil phagocytic capacity, although random or chemotactic migration was not affected (64793). Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine immunoenhanced CD4+ T cells isolated from 30 HIV+ and matching controls (64773). Mitogenesis was also enhanced in both groups approximately twofold. IL-2 production with activators anti-CD3, PMA, or anti-CD28 was enhanced two- to threefold for both groups. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine, however, suppressed IL-4 production by activators anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, also in both groups. An in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the effects of glutathione, glutathione ester, and N-acetyl cysteine on the induction of HIV expression in the chronically infected monocytic U1cell line (64537). N-acetyl cysteine suppressed reverse transcriptase activity >90%. Longer incubation periods produced greater suppression of reverse transcriptase. N-acetyl cysteine also inhibited the induction of HIV protein synthesis. Other in vitro research showed that N-acetyl cysteine inhibited TNF-alpha-stimulated HIV replication as well as cytokine-enhanced HIV long-terminal repeat-directed expression of beta-galactosidase (64649). In vitro, N-acetyl cysteine suppressed human immunodeficiency virus in persistently infected cells (64446).\nNephroprotective effects\nSome animal research suggests that N-acetyl cysteine improves outcomes after renal failure due to cadmium exposure, inferior vena cava occlusion, or ischemic kidney injury (64782, 64796, 64804).\nNeurological effects\nThe glutamatergic and antioxidant properties of N-acetyl cysteine are purported to improve neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism (91239, 91241), bipolar disorder (91234, 91237, 91243), and trichotillomania (16840, 91235). There is also interest in using N-acetyl cysteine for improving compulsive behaviors, which is associated with hyperactivity in the cortical-striatum-thalamus-cortical circuits, possibly due to abnormal glutamate levels (97045). N-acetyl cysteine appears to increase the uptake of cysteine. Uptake of cysteine activates a reverse transport of glutamate into the extracellular space. Restoring glutamate to the extracellular space inhibits further release of glutamate which improves compulsive behaviors (16840).\nNeuroprotective effects\nN-acetyl cysteine may offer neuronal protection by preserving mitochondria and protecting motor neurons (64625). It is hypothesized that neuroprotection may also be facilitated via the scavenging of free radicals and reduction of oxidative stress beyond the blood brain barrier. There is some interest in using N-acetyl cysteine for fetal neuroprotection after diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection, or chorioamnionitis. Early research shows that administering N-acetyl cysteine 100 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours until delivery decreases levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), increases levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), and reduces maternal cytokines, with no apparent negative effects on cardiovascular function or cerebral or systemic perfusion in the fetus or infant (97041).\nPulmonary effects\nSome clinical, animal, and in vitro research suggests that, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, N-acetyl cysteine may help break down mucus and provide a protective effect against lung injury caused by cigarette smoke or ischemia (64423, 64454, 64510, 64676, 64682, 64692, 64696, 64700, 64707, 64739)(64810, 64811).\nThyroid effects\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) shows that taking NAC orally, 600 mcg daily for 12 weeks, reduces reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) levels when compared with placebo. There is no effect on free T3, free thyroxine (FT4), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (108942)."

A small clinical study in patients with CFS shows that taking a specific product (ReConnect, Vitae Natural Nutrition) containing NADH 10 mg plus coenzyme Q10 100 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces fatigue index scores by about 6%, compared with about 3% in those taking placebo (93686). A larger clinical study also shows that taking NADH 20 mg plus coenzyme Q10 200 mg daily for 8 weeks improves some measures of fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life when compared with baseline. No improvements in these measures were reported with placebo (107448).

However, a large, open-label clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease shows that taking NADH 5 mg by mouth or administering intravenous NADH 12.5 mg over 30 minutes every other day for 14 days reduces disability scores by between 30% and 50% in around 19% of patients and reduces scores by between 10% and 30% in around 59% of patients when compared with baseline (3089). Also, a smaller, open-label clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease shows that administering intravenous NADH 10 mg over 30 minutes once daily for 7 days improves symptoms as measured by the UPDRS and increases the bioavailability of levodopa when compared with baseline (3086).

Seven days after initiating nattokinase 400 mg daily, the patient reported vertigo and unsteady gait and was diagnosed with an acute cerebellar hemorrhage.

Oral nattokinase has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that taking a combination product containing nattokinase 34 fibrinolytic units, chokeberry 1.64 grams, Panax ginseng 1.36 grams, and shiitake mushroom 960 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves measures of insulin resistance, but does not reduce fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when compared with placebo (108301).\nless\nInfertility. Although there has been interest in using oral nattokinase for infertility, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of nattokinase for this condition.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Although there has been interest in using oral nattokinase for stroke, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of nattokinase for this condition.\nVenous insufficiency. It is unclear if oral nattokinase is beneficial in patients with venous insufficiency.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with venous insufficiency who underwent vascular surgery suggests that taking nattokinase 2000 fibrinolytic units daily for 30 days after surgery may induce remission of clinical symptoms (109553). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral nattokinase is beneficial in patients with VTE.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or phlebitis suggests that taking nattokinase 2000 fibrinolytic units daily for 30 days after a 30-day regimen of fondaparinux or enoxaparin may induce remission of clinical symptoms (109553). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group and the use of anticoagulants before nattokinase therapy.\n\nNattokinase has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for prophylaxis of DVT during long-haul flights. A small clinical trial shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Flite Tabs, Aidan), containing 150 mg of a proprietary blend of nattokinase and maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research), 2 hours before a flight and 6 hours later, might decrease the risk of DVT during long plane flights (12075).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOral nattokinase seems to be bioavailable when administered to humans (12073, 92311). Animal research also suggests that nattokinase is sufficiently absorbed in the intestinal tract to have systemic effects (12074, 92311).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNattokinase is a serine proteinase enzyme derived from the Japanese food natto. Natto is boiled soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis (12072, 12090, 92311, 92312). Nattokinase is thought to be produced through this fermentation process and is not found in other soy foods. Nattokinase is composed of 275 amino acid residues (64832, 92312).\nAntithrombotic effects\nIn vitro and clinical evidence suggests that nattokinase has antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects (12070, 12073, 92311). It works by inactivating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and its fibrinolytic activity is 4 times that of plasmin (12070, 12074, 12091, 64831). Its average activity is about 40 CU (plasmin units)/gram (12072). Nattokinase might prevent atherosclerosis due to its fibrinolytic activity at the blood vessel wall. Animal research shows that taking a natto extract containing nattokinase can reduce vessel wall thickening following endothelial injury. Nattokinase also seems to cause lysis of thrombi that form at the vessel wall (12070, 12071). However, a clinical study in patients at low risk for cardiovascular disease shows that taking nattokinase 2000 fibrinolytic units orally daily for a median of 3 years is not associated with any change in subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by carotid artery intima-media thickness and carotid arterial stiffness (106406).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is some interest in using nattokinase for gastrointestinal conditions, specifically inflammatory bowel disease. Animal research shows that a specifically engineered recombinant probiotic strain (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 [EcNnatto]) designed to express nattokinase mitigates clinical symptoms of colitis. Further, in the mouse model of induced colitis, this product appears to increase colon length, reduce drug activity index scores, and decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines when compared with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) alone and placebo. The anti-inflammatory effects suggest that this product might reduce intestinal epithelial barrier injury and mucosal inflammation normally associated with colitis. This product also increased the expression of occludin and the production of Lgr5, both of which may aid in the restoration of the intestinal epithelial barrier (111254)."

The limonoid constituents in neem, which have been shown to inhibit melanogenesis and have cytotoxic effects, combined with repeated, local trauma from this dental hygiene practice are thought to cause this leucodermic reaction. In a case series of seven patients experiencing vitiligo of the lips from neem twigs, use of toothpaste and topical tacrolimus along with avoidance of neem stopped the progression of depigmentation in all patients. Repigmentation was reported in four of the seven patients 12 months after discontinuing neem-based dental hygiene practices (100958).\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, neem products have been associated with dermatologic reactions. Some case reports have associated the use of topical neem oil with contact dermatitis (64851, 94568, 102867). In one case series, the topical application of neem seed extract shampoo was associated with skin irritation, red spots, and a burning feeling of the scalp (64848).

It is unclear if neem is as effective as chlorhexidine for this purpose.\nClinical research shows that using neem topically as a mouth rinse or gel extract twice daily for 3 weeks to 3 months can reduce dental plaque in some patients (12824, 64845, 94567, 97926, 104182). Neem leaf extracts, including one at a concentration of 2.5%, have been applied to the teeth and gums twice daily for up to 3 months (12824, 64845, 104182). Rinsing with 5 mL of neem solution (concentration unknown) or 15 mL of neem 2% solution twice daily for up to 30 days has also been used (94567, 97926).\n\nIt is unclear how neem compares to chlorhexidine for this purpose. One small clinical trial shows that applying neem gel shows similar improvements in plaque index when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% gel (104182), while another small study shows that rinsing with a neem solution may not be as effective as chlorhexidine 0.2% solution for reducing dental plaque (97926). Reasons for these disparate findings are unclear, but may be related to differences in patient populations, formulations used, and study length.\nless\nGingivitis. Topical neem mouth rinses and gel extracts may reduce gingivitis, but neem may not be effective in patients with chronic gingivitis. It is unclear if neem is as effective as chlorhexidine for this purpose.\nClinical research shows that using neem topically as a mouth rinse or gel extract twice daily for 3 weeks to 3 months appears to improve gingivitis in some patients (12824, 64845, 94567, 104182).

Although there has been interest in using oral and intravaginal neem for contraception, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of neem for this purpose.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is limited evidence on the oral use of a neem leaf extract in preventing COVID-19 in high-risk individuals.\nA clinical study in adults at high risk for COVID-19 infection (e.g. healthcare workers and relatives of patients with COVID-19) shows that taking a specific capsule formulation of neem leaf extract (Nisarga's Neem; Nisarga Biotech) 50 mg twice daily for 28 days decreases the rate of COVID-19 infections by day 29 to 4%, compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group. This suggests that 17 patients would need to take this product to prevent one infection (107882). The validity of this study is limited by the short duration of treatment and unclear reporting. Additionally, patients were only tested for COVID-19 at baseline, day 29, or if symptoms were present; therefore, asymptomatic COVID-19 infections may have been underreported.\nless\nCough. Although there has been interest in using oral neem for cough, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of neem for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral neem extract is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking metformin shows that taking a specific neem leaf and twig extract (PhytoBGS; Natreon Inc) 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves glycemic control in a dose-dependent manner. When compared with placebo, reductions in fasting plasma glucose with neem extract ranged from 8-22 mg/dL and reductions in glycated hemoglobin ranged from 0.18% to 1.47%. Postprandial glucose and measures of insulin resistance and endothelial function were also improved (104181).\nless\nDyspepsia.

In the treatment group, reductions in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranged from 3-6 mg/dL, 0.7-5.4 mg/dL, and 0.6% to 1.7%, respectively (107881). However, there was no improvement in lipid parameters, and a lower dose of 125 mg twice daily did not affect any measurements (107881). The validity of this study is limited due to unclear reporting.\nless\nMosquito repellent. Small clinical studies suggest that topical creams containing neem oil may provide moderate to high-level protection against mosquitos.\nSeveral small clinical studies show that topical application of a cream containing neem oil 1%, 2%, or 5% provides 37.5% to 100% protection against mosquitoes when compared with a placebo cream. Effectiveness seems to vary depending on mosquito species and geographic location (64876, 64878, 64882).\nless\nOsteoarthritis.

It is unclear if oral neem is beneficial in patients with peptic ulcers.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in six patients with peptic ulcers shows that taking neem bark extract 30-60 mg twice daily for 10 weeks reduces gastric secretions when compared to baseline and might aid in the healing of gastroduodenal ulcers. All patients treated with neem bark extract experienced at least 80% healing of gastroduodenal ulcers (12822). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small study size and the lack of a control group.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral neem is beneficial in patients with psoriasis.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with uncomplicated psoriasis shows that taking neem extract by mouth daily in combination with daily sun exposure and application of a Vaseline-based cream containing crude coal tar and salicylic acid for 12 weeks reduces psoriasis symptom severity by approximately 50% when compared with placebo (64892).\nless\nScleroderma. Topical neem has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research in patients with systemic sclerosis has found that topical application of a specific cream (Holoil, RI.MOS.

It is unknown if these effects are due to neem, St. John's wort, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these results is limited by a lack of randomization, blinding, and placebo-control.\nless\nTungiasis. It is unclear if topical neem oil is beneficial for the treatment of tungiasis.\nOne small clinical trial in children aged 6-15 years with tungiasis shows that topical application of an oil mixture containing neem seed oil 20% and virgin coconut oil 80%, 1 drop on days 1 and 3, kills about 40% of sand fleas within 7 days, a rate similar to standard treatment with a potassium permanganate 0.05% foot bath (104258).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there has been interest in using oral neem for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of neem for this purpose.\nWound healing. Topical neem has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-size clinical study in adults with dehisced post-surgical wounds shows that applying a specific aerosol product (1PWD, Kerecis AG) containing neem oil and St. John's wort to wounds during dressing changes does not improve wound healing scores at day 28 but may reduce pain scores when compared with silver-based dressings (alginates or polyurethane foam) (111592).

Signs and symptoms of overdose include gastrointestinal symptoms (loose stools, vomiting), hematologic abnormalities (anemia, metabolic acidosis, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis), hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and adverse neurologic effects (cerebral edema, coma, drowsiness, encephalopathy, loss of consciousness, seizures) (3473, 3474, 3476, 64865, 94750). Pathologic findings on liver and kidney biopsy reports in these children are consistent with Reye-like syndrome (3473, 3474, 3475).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with neem in adults.\n\nIn infants and young children, treatment of overdose with neem is supportive in nature, with a focus on managing convulsions and other symptoms related to the overdose (3476).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of neem.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of neem are the bark, leaf, seed, seed oil, and less frequently, the root, flower, and fruit. More than 135 compounds have been isolated from neem. Neem contains isoprenoids, proteins, polysaccharides, flavonoids, dihydrochalcone, coumarin, tannins, and other compounds. Nimbidin, a constituent of neem seed oil, contains sulfur and is thought to give neem seed oil its unpleasant odor (13384). Methods have been developed to remove the bitterness and odor (13384).\nAnti-acne effects\nNeem leaf extract has been used for acne. It seems to have astringent, antiviral, discutient, stimulant, and antibacterial properties, which may result in its activity against acne (64863).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nNeem bark contains tannins and polysaccharides that might have anti-inflammatory activity (12823). Topically, neem oil may modulate macrophage migration and activity, leading to inhibition of inflammation at the wound site and promoting healing (102867).\nAnticancer effects\nNeem bark polysaccharides seem to have antitumor effects (12829, 64864).\nAntimalarial effects\nThe neem seed oil constituent nimbolide seems to have antimalarial and antibacterial activity. Gedunin appears to have activity against fungal and malarial microbes. Azadirachtin also has antimalarial activity and is used as an insecticide (12823, 12836, 64866, 64881).\nAntimicrobial effect\nPreliminary research suggests neem seed oil has antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral effects (13384, 102867). Margolone, margolonone, and isomargolonone appear to be active against bacteria such as Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Serratia species (12823). Neem extracts have been shown to exert inhibitory effects on bacterial growth and cholera toxin (64862). Sulfur-containing neem leaf extracts seem to have antifungal effects. (12823). Mahmoodin has antibacterial activity (12823, 12836, 64866, 64881).\nAntioxidant effects\nOne clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific neem leaf and twig extract (Puritan's Pride Inc) 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks affects antioxidant levels and markers of oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, such as increasing levels of nitric oxide and reducing levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-2, and malondialdehyde when compared with placebo. A lower dose of 125 mg twice daily did not improve these measures (107881).\nAntiparasitic effects\nNeem is used as a remedy for endo- and ectoparasites (64854). Tap water and shampoo dilutions of neem seed extract have been examined as an acaricidal and insecticidal (64857).\nAntiviral\nPreliminary clinical research suggests neem seed oil has antiviral effects (13384). Extracts from neem have been implicated in delaying the progression of HIV by targeting lipid rafts (64852).\nContraceptive effects\nNeem leaf extract seems to have antispermatogenic and antiandrogenic properties. It seems to adversely affect sperm mobility and viability (12826, 12828). Nimbidin and another neem seed oil constituent, nimbin, have spermicidal activity (12823, 12836). Neem seed oil also might have immunostimulant effects which augment its contraceptive effects. It seems to stimulate cellular immune response. Preliminary clinical research suggests it might be useful as a long-term vaginal contraceptive, an effect that may be caused by a local cell-mediated immune response to the allogenic sperm and embryo (12825). A single intravaginal dose of neem seed extract provides long-term, reversible contraception in animals (12827). Preliminary clinical research suggests that neem oil does not have teratogenic or mutagenic effects (13384).\nGastrointestinal effects\nNeem has been used for peptic ulcers. An aqueous extract of neem bark seems to have antisecretory and antiulcer activity (12822). An extract of neem fruit seems to also have antiulcer activity (12823).\nHepatoprotective\nPreliminary research suggests that neem leaf extract might protect the liver from the hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen (12831, 12832).\nPesticidal effects\nAzadirachtin is a tetranortriterpinoid constituent of neem that interrupts metamorphosis in insects, causing pesticidal effects (64842, 64856, 104258).\nToxic effects\nNeem oil is toxic to infants and children, but the toxic constituent is unknown (3473, 3475). Researchers speculate that a long-chain monounsaturated free acid may be responsible (3475). In rat liver mitochondria in vitro, neem oil was a strong mitochondrial toxin, causing overall mitochondrial dysfunction and energy crisis. It caused uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased ATP production, inhibition of the electron-transport chain, and decreases in concentrations of intramitochondrial acetyl CoA and free CoA-SH. The toxic effects on mitochondrial respiration may be due to alteration of fatty acid metabolism by neem oil. Reye-like syndrome noted in infants who had consumed neem oil may occur because of its mitochondrial toxic effects. Neem oil consists mainly of long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (stearic, oleic, palmitic, linoleic) and some medium chain fatty acids. It also contains terpenoids, nimbin and nimbiol (64869). Neem oil induces mitochondrial permeability transition in rat liver mitochondria, causing mitochondrial swelling, depolarization, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (64885)."

It is unclear if oral New Zealand green-lipped mussel is beneficial in children with asthma.\nOne small clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic asthma shows that taking a specific lipid extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Lyprinol, Pharmalink), providing 50 mg omega-3 fatty acids, twice daily for 8 weeks decreases daytime wheezing and increases morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) when compared with placebo. However, this extract does not improve evening PEF or forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (15048). Another small clinical study in college students with persistent asthma shows that taking this same extract, providing 400 mg omega-3 fatty acids, daily for 3 weeks improves symptoms, reduces use of bronchodilators by about 7 puffs per day, and increases mean morning and evening peak flow by about 22 L/min when compared with placebo in patients with persistent asthma (94493). However, a small clinical study in children with moderate asthma shows that taking this extract providing 200 mg omega-3 fatty acids daily for 16 weeks does not reduce the use of asthma medication or improve symptoms when compared with placebo (94495).

Small clinical studies suggest that oral New Zealand green-lipped mussel extract may reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness in trained and untrained individuals.\nSeveral small clinical studies in long distance runners and untrained males show that taking a specific lipid extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel (PCSO-524, sold as Lyprinol or Omega XL, Pharmalink) or a specific blend of New Zealand green-lipped mussel lipid extract and Antarctic krill oil (ESPO-572, sold as Lyprinol Advanced, Pharmalink) reduces delayed-onset muscle soreness when compared with placebo (101896, 102379, 105509). In long distance runners, taking 400 mg daily for 11 weeks modestly reduces muscle soreness 24- and 48-hours after a 30 km training run (102379). In untrained males, taking 400 mg daily for 30 days, starting 26 days before a downhill run, reduces muscle soreness 72 and 96 hours later. However, there was no effect on pain threshold, thigh swelling, or strength recovery (101896). Also, taking the combination product (ESPO-572), providing 200 mg daily for 30 days, starting 26 days before a downhill run, reduces muscle soreness and increases pain threshold and range of motion when compared with placebo.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNew Zealand green-lipped mussel is a mollusk native to New Zealand. Freeze-dried mussel powder or lipid extracts are typically used in dietary supplements (15022, 94493, 94494, 94495). New Zealand green-lipped mussel contains about 2% lipids. Of these, about 60% are phospholipids, 22% are triglycerides, and 12% are free fatty acids (15064). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) make up about 45% of the total fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily including docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, make about 40% of total PUFAs (15049, 54161). Omega-6 fatty acids make up about 5% of total PUFAs (15049). Saturated fatty acids make up about 26% of total fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) make up about 23% of total fatty acid content. New Zealand green-lipped mussel also contains sterols. The most abundant sterol is cholesterol, about 30% (15049, 15064, 54161). New Zealand green-lipped mussel also contains palmitic acid, myristic acid, and stearic acid (105508).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nThere is interest in using New Zealand green-lipped mussel for arthritis due to a finding in early cancer research. Cancer patients, who took New Zealand green-lipped mussel preparations to test its potential role against cancer, reported that they had less joint pain and stiffness and improved joint movement (15022). Anti-arthritic effects of New Zealand green-lipped mussel are likely related to its anti-inflammatory effects (15022, 54167, 107926). However, some animal research also shows that New Zealand green-lipped mussel extract has chondroprotective effects, as evidenced by reduced levels of markers associated with cartilage destruction in a rat model of osteoarthritis (107926).\n\nIn a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, New Zealand green-lipped mussel appears to modulate the overall severity of arthritis and reduce inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage damage when compared with a control group. Furthermore, New Zealand green-lipped mussel appears to reduce proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1- beta, and interleukin-17 inside the joint, and decrease the number of interleukin-17-producing helper T cells. In vitro, New Zealand green-lipped mussel appears to suppress osteoclastogenesis in human-and mouse-derived monocytes when compared with a control group. Researchers theorize that this may be due to the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis-associated genes or the suppression of tartrate-resistant phosphatase (110714).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using New Zealand green-lipped mussel lipids in cancer patients. This is based on the potential for these lipids to cause apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro (94494).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome evidence suggests that New Zealand green-lipped mussel contains a prostaglandin inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory effects (932, 933). Some animal models suggest that a freeze-dried mussel extract has anti-inflammatory activity when administered intraperitoneally, but not when administered orally (15022). However, other animal model research shows anti-inflammatory activity when given orally (16051, 110714). Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily including, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, make about 40% of total PUFAs (15049). New Zealand green-lipped mussel extract, containing these omega-3 fatty acids, can decrease prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, involved in downstream inflammatory processes such as cytokine production (15022, 15048, 54148, 54165, 54166, 54168, 54186). The lipid extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel has also shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (54169). However, anti-inflammatory effects of the mussel have also been attributed to protein or glycogen components (932, 933).\nGastroprotective effects\nThere is interest in using New Zealand green-lipped mussel extracts and lipids to protect against gastrointestinal damage associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS). The potential gastroprotective effects are likely related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the mussel (94492).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using New Zealand green-lipped mussel oil for weight loss. Animal research shows that consuming New Zealand green-lipped mussel oil prevents weight gain in mice consuming high-fat diets and reduces weight in obese mice consuming high-fat diets (105508)."

            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when niacin is taken in food or as a supplement in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 30 mg daily for adults 18 years of age and 35 mg daily for adults 19 years and older (6243). ...when prescription products are used orally and appropriately in doses of up to 2 grams daily (12033).\nLIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs of niacin for children are: 1-3 years of age, 10 mg daily; 4-8 years of age, 15 mg daily; 9-13 years of age, 20 mg daily; 14-18 years of age, 30 mg daily (6243).\nCHILDREN:\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL of niacin during pregnancy and lactation is 30 mg daily for 14-18 years of age and 35 mg daily for 19 years and older (6243).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger oral doses of niacin during pregnancy or lactation; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, niacin is well tolerated in the amounts found in foods. It is also generally well tolerated in prescription doses when monitored by a healthcare provider.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Flushing, gastrointestinal complaints (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomiting), and elevated liver enzymes.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hepatotoxicity, myopathy, thrombocytopenia, and vision changes.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, flushing is a common dose-related adverse reaction to niacin. A large meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that up to 70% of patients may experience flushing (96211). Although flushing can occur with doses of niacin as low as 30 mg daily, it is more common with the larger doses used for treatment of dyslipidemia. The flushing reaction is due to prostaglandin-induced blood vessel dilation and can also include symptoms of burning, tingling, urticaria, erythema, pain, and itching of the face, arms, and chest. There may also be increased intracranial blood flow and headache (4889, 26089, 93341, 104933). Onset is highly variable and ranges from within 30 minutes to as long as 6 weeks after the initial dose (6243). Flushing can be minimized via various strategies, including taking doses with meals, slow dose titration, using extended release formulations, pretreating with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, taking regular-release niacin with meals, or taking the sustained-release product at bedtime (4852, 4853, 4854, 4857, 4858, 25922, 26073, 26084). Flushing often diminishes with continued use but can recur when niacin is restarted after missed doses (4863, 6243, 26081). The vasodilating effects of niacin can also cause hypotension, dizziness, tachycardia, arrhythmias, syncope, and vasovagal attacks, especially in patients who are already taking antihypertensive drugs (4863, 12033, 93341, 110494).\n\nHigh doses of niacin can raise homocysteine levels. A 17% increase has been reported with 1 gram daily and a 55% increased has been reported with 3 grams daily. Elevated homocysteine levels are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (490); however, the clinical significance of this effect is unknown. A large-scale study (AIM-HIGH) found that patients receiving extended-release niacin (Niaspan) 1500-2000 mg daily with a statin had an over two-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke (1.6%) when compared with those receiving only simvastatin (0.7%). However, when the risk was adjusted for confounding factors, niacin was not found to be associated with increased stroke risk (17627, 93354). A meta-analysis of three clinical trials conducted in approximately 29,000 patients showed a higher risk of mortality in patients taking niacin in addition to a statin when compared with a statin alone. However, with a p-value of 0.05 and confidence interval including 1, the validity of this finding remains unclear (97308).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, niacin can impair glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. Dosages of 3-4 grams daily appear to increase blood glucose in patients with or without diabetes, while dosages of 1.5 grams daily or less have minimal effects (12033). Niacin is thought to impair glucose tolerance by increasing insulin resistance or increasing hepatic output of glucose (4863, 11692, 11693). In patients with diabetes, niacin 4.5 grams daily for 5 weeks has been associated with an average 16% increase in plasma glucose and 21% increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (4860). Up to 35% of patients with diabetes may need to increase the dose or number of hypoglycemic agents when niacin is started (4458, 4860, 4863, 11689, 12033). Occasionally, severe hyperglycemia requiring hospitalization can occur (11693). In patients with impaired fasting glucose levels, niacin may also increase fasting blood glucose, and adding colesevelam might attenuate this effect (93343).\n\nAlthough patients without diabetes seem to only experience small and clinically insignificant increases in glucose (4458), niacin might increase their risk of developing diabetes. A meta-analysis of clinical research involving over 26,000 patients shows that using niacin over 5 years is associated with increased prevalence of new onset type 2 diabetes at a rate of 1 additional case of diabetes for every 43 patients treated with niacin (96207). This finding is limited because the individual trials were not designed to assess diabetes risk and the analysis could not be adjusted for confounding factors like obesity. One small clinical study shows that taking extended-release niacin with ezetimibe/simvastatin does not increase the risk of a new diagnosis of diabetes or need for antidiabetic medication when compared with ezetimibe/simvastatin alone after 16 months (93344). This may indicate that the increased risk of developing diabetes is associated with niacin use for more than 16 months.\n\nNiacin therapy has also been linked with hypothyroidism and its associated alterations in thyroid hormone and binding globulin tests (such as decreased total serum thyroxine, increased triiodothyronine, decreased thyroxine-binding globulin levels, and increased triiodothyronine uptake) (25916, 25925, 25926, 25928).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, large doses of niacin can cause gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, bloating, heartburn, abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, and activation of peptic ulcers (4458, 4863, 12033, 26083, 93341, 96211). These effects may be reduced by taking the drug with meals or antacid, and usually disappear within two weeks of continued therapy (4851, 26094). Gastrointestinal effects may be more common with time-release preparations of niacin (11691).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, sustained-release niacin has been associated with cases of reversible coagulopathy, mild eosinophilia, and decreased platelet counts (4818, 25915, 26097, 93340). Also, there have been reports of patients who developed leukopenia while taking niacin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (25916).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, niacin is associated with elevated liver function tests and jaundice, especially with doses of 3 grams/day or more, and when doses are rapidly increased (4458, 4863, 6243). The risk of hepatotoxicity appears to be higher with slow-release and extended-release products (4855, 4856, 4863, 6243, 11691, 12026, 12033, 93342). Niacin should be discontinued if liver function tests rise to three times the upper limit of normal (4863). There are rare cases of severe hepatotoxicity with fulminant hepatitis and encephalopathy due to niacin (4863, 6243, 11691). In one case, a patient taking extended-release niacin 2500 mg daily for 15 years developed decompensating cirrhosis and was diagnosed with chronic, toxic, metabolic liver injury. Despite medical intervention, the patient died (113553). Also, there is at least one case of niacin-induced coagulopathy resulting from liver injury without liver enzyme changes (93340).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, niacin has been associated with elevated creatine kinase levels (4818, 4888). Also, several cases of niacin-induced myopathy have been reported (26100, 26111). Concomitant administration of niacin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (14508, 25918, 26111); patients should be monitored closely.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, high-dose niacin has been associated with cases of neuropsychiatric adverse events such as extreme pain and psychosis. Two 65-year-old males taking niacin orally for 5 months for the treatment of dyslipidemias developed severe dental and gingival pain. The pain was relieved by the discontinuation of niacin. The pain was thought to be due to inflammation and pain referral to the teeth (4862). In one case report, a 52-year-old male with no history of psychiatric illness who initially complained of hot flushes when taking niacin 500 mg daily, presented with an acute psychotic episode involving mania after niacin was increased to 1000 mg daily (93350).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, chronic use of large amounts of niacin has been associated with dry eyes, toxic amblyopia, blurred vision, eyelid swelling, eyelid discoloration, loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, proptosis, keratitis, macular edema, and cystic maculopathy, which appear to be dose-dependent and reversible (4863, 6243, 26112).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDyslipidemia. Niacin prescription products, in doses of 500 mg or greater, are FDA-approved for primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Niacin dietary supplements are generally available in lower doses and have not been shown to improve lipid levels.\nPrescription niacin is not routinely recommended as second-line therapy for patients who primarily need to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is due to results from clinical trials showing no effect on cardiovascular related events or mortality (93346, 93354, 96208, 96211, 97308, 97477, 97336). However, niacin might be considered for patients with mixed hyperlipidemia or patients who need to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower triglycerides. Niacin might also be effective for isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia (4817).\n\nThe most pronounced increases in HDL and decreases in triglycerides occur at 1-1.5 grams daily, and the greatest LDL reduction occurs at 2-3 grams daily. Niacin reduces LDL cholesterol by up to 25%, compared with up to a 55% reduction with statins. High-dose niacin can also decrease triglycerides by 20% to 50%, increase HDL by 13% to 35%, decrease apolipoprotein B levels by 2% to 20%, and decrease lipoprotein(a) levels by 23% (4818, 4886, 4887, 4888, 4889, 4890, 12033, 25567, 93347, 96213). The effects of higher dose extended-release niacin on LDL cholesterol and triglycerides appear to be greater in females than males (25565). Experts recommend maximizing statins first because they have the best evidence for improving cardiovascular outcomes (97477, 97336, 97337). However, if patients cannot reach their LDL goal with a statin alone or if they cannot tolerate a statin, niacin might be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs when diet and single-drug therapy are not adequately effective (8545, 25566, 93351, 94191, 97337). Adding low-dose niacin, 50 mg daily, to statin therapy has no additional benefit on lipid levels (8546).\n\nPopulation research in adults without dyslipidemia has also found that higher dietary intake of niacin for 3-10 years is associated with a 29% lower risk of developing dyslipidemia when compared with low dietary niacin intake (110493).\nless\nPellagra. Oral niacin is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of pellagra.\nPopulation research has found that low consumption of niacin is associated with an increased risk of developing pellagra (25903). Taking niacin 500-1000 mg daily can resolve symptoms of pellagra within a week of treatment initiation (25904). However, niacinamide is sometimes preferred for this indication because it lacks the vasodilating effects of niacin (15, 6243).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia due to HIV/AIDs.\nSmall clinical trials in HIV patients with dyslipidemia associated with antiretroviral therapy shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated up to 2 grams daily for 14-48 weeks improves total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared to baseline (25570, 25902). Other preliminary clinical research in this population shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 2 grams daily for up to 2 years improves HDL cholesterol levels, but not total cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with no treatment (25569).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nClinical research shows that taking niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) 2 grams daily orally for 16 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 39 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared to baseline in patients with metabolic syndrome. These improvements are significant when compared with placebo and are further increased when niacin is taken along with prescription omega-3 ethyl esters (Lovaza, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily orally (93353). However, niacin does not seem to improve postprandial glucose levels in patients with metabolic syndrome (97333).\nless\nINEFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral niacin does not seem to reduce cardiovascular-related events in patients with or without CVD.\nOverall, niacin is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. Most clinical trials and meta-analyses conducted prior to 2011 showed a reduction in cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients taking niacin alone or in combination with a statin or clofibrate for primary or secondary prevention of CVD (4847, 7388, 25095, 25911, 25912, 93349). However, recent meta-analyses of these studies and additional moderate-to-high quality research conducted in over 39,000 patients show no effect of niacin on cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, or overall mortality (93346, 93354, 96208, 96211, 97308). Additionally, one meta-analysis shows that patients taking niacin are twice as likely to report side effects when compared with placebo (96211).\n\nFurthermore, an analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors (113554).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for reducing Alzheimer disease risk.\nObservational research has found that consuming higher amounts of niacin (17-45 mg daily) from food and supplements is associated with a slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with people who consume less niacin (14 mg daily) (12077). It is not known if the risk of Alzheimer disease is reduced by taking a stand-alone niacin supplement.\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral niacin prevents atherosclerosis progression.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that taking niacin orally, in combination with colestipol for up to 2 years, might modestly reduce progression of atherosclerosis as measured by coronary lesions and carotid arterial intima-media thickness in high-risk males with existing coronary atherosclerosis (25906, 25909, 25910). However, niacin does not seem to be better than statins. One clinical study in adults with atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease shows that taking extended-release niacin 1500 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 2 years does not reduce atherosclerosis of the superficial femoral artery when compared with simvastatin alone (96208). Niacin has also not been shown to prevent cardiovascular events or mortality (93346, 93354, 96208, 96211, 97308).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral niacin improves athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in untrained adult males shows that taking niacin 1000 mg orally once before a cycling test does not improve power, respiratory exchange ratio, or time to exhaustion when compared with placebo. In addition, these measures were significantly worse when compared with taking caffeine 5 mg/kg orally as a single dose (107942).\n\nClinical research in untrained males also shows that taking a supplement containing niacin 40 mg, caffeine 400 mg, capsicum extract 66.7 mg, and black pepper extract 10 mg prior to exercising does not improve strength, time to exhaustion, or maximal oxygen consumption when compared with placebo (37873).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral niacin for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition.\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for cancer.\nPopulation research in adults with cancer has found that high dietary niacin intake is associated with 49% and 27% lower risk of cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality when compared with low dietary niacin intake. The same study also found that taking niacin supplements is associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality, but not all-cause mortality when compared with not taking niacin supplements (110496).\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing cataracts.\nPopulation research has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a reduced risk of nuclear cataracts (6378). However, there is no reliable evidence that niacin supplements reduce the risk of cataracts.\nless\nCholera. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for cholera.\nOne small clinical study in adults with severe cholera shows that taking 1-2 grams niacin orally reduces fluid loss in the stool by 31% to 47% in the first 16 hours when compared with control. The 2 gram dose seemed to result in a greater reduction in fluid loss than the 1 gram dose (4868).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial in patients with ED and dyslipidemia.\nClinical research in patients with erectile dysfunction and dyslipidemia shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 1.5 grams nightly for a total of 12 weeks significantly improves penetration frequency and the maintenance of an erection after penetration when compared to baseline (25913). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing or treating glaucoma.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of niacin is associated with a lower odds of having glaucoma. However, this association was not consistently present when adjusting for confounders. The effects of niacin supplementation on glaucoma have not been evaluated (107942).\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing high levels of phosphorus in the blood.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients on maintenance dialysis who are no longer using phosphate binders shows that taking niacin 375-750 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces serum phosphorus levels by 2.1 mg/dL, increases calcium levels by 0.4 mg/dL, and decreases serum alkaline phosphatase when compared with baseline (25914). A small clinical study in Iranian adults on maintenance hemodialysis, with baseline serum phosphorus levels within normal range, shows that adding niacin 600 mg daily to standard of care for 8 weeks slightly reduces serum phosphorus levels when compared with control (116763). Clinical significance is unlikely. However, clinical research in patients on dialysis with inadequate phosphate control despite standard phosphate-binding therapy shows that taking niacin at the maximum tolerated dose, up to 1000 mg daily, for 12 weeks, does not decrease serum phosphate levels when compared with placebo (93341). It is possible that this latter study was too small to observe between-group differences in changes in serum phosphate levels.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing hypertension.\nObservational research in Chinese adults found a J-shaped association between dietary niacin intake and development of hypertension, with the lowest risk occurring in those with a daily dietary niacin intake of 14.3-16.7 mg (104934).\nless\nMeniere disease. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for Meniere disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition.\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing migraine headaches.\nPopulation research in adults has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a 28% lower likelihood of having migraine headaches when compared with low dietary intake of niacin (110495). However, the effect of niacin supplementation on migraines has not been studied.\nless\nMotion sickness. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this purpose.\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving Parkinson disease symptoms.\nLow-quality clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months improves Parkinson disease motor scores and fatigue scores by 17% and 26%, respectively, when compared with baseline (107944). However, higher quality clinical research shows that taking niacin 250 mg orally daily for 6 months does not improve Parkinson disease motor scores when compared with placebo (107943).\nless\nRetinal vein occlusion. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving retinal vein occlusion symptoms.\nA small case series in patients with chronic retinal vein occlusion shows that taking niacin titrated to 500 mg three times daily for 1 year is associated with reduced central macular thickness and improved visual acuity in over 50% of patients when compared with a control group. The addition of prednisolone eye drops does not alter the outcomes of those taking niacin (96212). The validity of this finding is limited due to the retrospective nature of this study.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition.\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving lipid levels in patients with sickle cell disease.\nA small clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease shows that taking extended-release niacin titrated to 1.5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve vascular function or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or apolipoprotein A-I cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (96209).\nless\nVertigo. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for vertigo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate niacin for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: Niacin is expressed on supplement labels as Niacin Equivalents (NE). 1 mg of niacin is the same as 1 mg NE. However, the total niacin content stated on a label can also include other forms of niacin, including niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, and tryptophan. Tryptophan 60 mg, niacinamide 1 mg, and inositol nicotinate 1 mg are all equivalent to 1 mg NE (6243). The Institute of Medicine publishes a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin B3, which includes niacin and niacinamide. The daily RDA of vitamin B3, expressed as NE, is: males 14 years and older, 16 mg NE; females 14 years and older, 14 mg NE; pregnancy, 18 mg NE; and breastfeeding, 17 mg NE (6243).\n\nPrescription niacin is most often used at a dose of 1-2 grams daily. Research on the use of supplemental niacin is limited. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nConcomitant ingestion of hot drinks with niacin may magnify niacin-induced flushing (6243).\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily adequate intake (AI) of vitamin B3 for infants 0-6 months of age is 2 mg of preformed niacin. For all other age groups, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide) is expressed as niacin equivalents (NE). The RDA for children is: 7-12 months of age, 4 mg NE; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg NE; 4-8 years of age, 8 mg NE; 9-13 years of age, 12 mg NE; females 14-18 years of age, 14 mg NE; males 14-18 years of age, 16 mg NE (6243).\n\nResearch is limited; typical dosing of supplemental niacin is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nNiacin is available in immediate-release formulations and, by prescription, in extended-release formulations. One specific extended-release niacin prescription formulation (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) releases niacin at a rate of 100 mg/hour (18).",

Large doses of niacin might also exacerbate liver dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. A case report describes delirium and lactic acidosis in a patient taking niacin 3 grams daily who ingested 1 liter of wine (14510). Advise patients to avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin.\nless\nALLOPURINOL (Zyloprim)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nC (Expert opinion)\nTheoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as allopurinol.\nLarge doses of niacin can reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially resulting in hyperuricemia (4860, 4863, 12033). Doses of uricosurics such as allopurinol might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin (4458). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin (4863).\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, niacin may have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\nSeveral cases of clotting factor synthesis deficiency and coagulopathy have been reported in patients taking sustained-release niacin (25915). Also, thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with niacin or niacin plus lovastatin (25916).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nNiacin can increase blood glucose levels and may diminish the effects of antidiabetes drugs.\nNiacin impairs glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance and increasing hepatic production of glucose (4860, 4863, 11692, 11693). In diabetes patients, niacin 4.5 grams daily for 5 weeks can increase plasma glucose by an average of 16% and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 21% (4860). However, lower doses of 1.5 grams daily or less appear to have minimal effects on blood glucose (12033). In some patients, glucose levels increase when niacin is started, but then return to baseline when a stable dose is reached (12033, 93344). Up to 35% of patients with diabetes may need adjustments in hypoglycemic therapy when niacin is added (4458, 4860, 4863, 11689, 12033).\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nTheoretically, niacin may increase the risk of hypotension when used with antihypertensive drugs.\nThe vasodilating effects of niacin can cause hypotension (4863, 12033, 93341). Furthermore, some clinical evidence suggests that a one-hour infusion of niacin can reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure in hypertensive patients. This effect is not observed in normotensive patients (25917).\nless\nASPIRIN\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nLarge doses of aspirin might alter the clearance of niacin.\nAspirin is often used with niacin to reduce niacin-induced flushing (4458, 11689). Doses of 80-975 mg aspirin have been used, but 325 mg appears to be optimal (4458, 4852, 4853, 11689). Aspirin also seems to reduce the clearance of niacin by competing for glycine conjugation. Taking aspirin 1 gram seems to reduce niacin clearance by 45% (14524). This is probably a dose-related effect and not clinically significant with the more common aspirin dose of 325 mg (11689, 14524).\nless\nBILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nBile acid sequestrants can bind niacin and decrease absorption. Separate administration by 4-6 hours to avoid an interaction.\nIn vitro studies show that colestipol (Colestid) binds about 98% of available niacin and cholestyramine (Questran) binds 10% to 30% (14511).\nless\nGEMFIBROZIL (Lopid)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil might increase the risk of myopathy in some patients.\nA case of myopathy from concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil has been reported (25920).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nNiacin is water-soluble and well-absorbed when taken orally (505, 6243, 11694). A single 1 gram dose of regular niacin appears to increase plasma levels of niacin from 0.15 mcg/mL to 16.5 mcg/mL by 60 minutes after oral ingestion (522). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of extended-release niacin 2 grams appears to be 9.3 mcg/mL; this concentration occurs at 4.6 hours after oral ingestion (26128). In humans, the bioavailability of unchanged niacin from a single 500 mg dose appears to be 1% from two slow-release formulations and 25% from a rapid-release formulation (26129).\nMetabolism\nNiacin is metabolized in the liver to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are essential for oxidation-reduction reactions, ATP synthesis, and ADP-ribose transfer reactions (2677).\nExcretion\nUrinary excretion of the metabolites N-methylnicotinamide, nicotinamide-N-oxide, N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5 carboxamide, nicotinamide, and nicotinuric acid has been shown following oral administration of niacin, with the highest recovery being for N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, N-methylnicotinamide, and nicotinuric acid (26130). Regular niacin preparations result in higher 24-hour urinary concentrations of nicotinuric acid than controlled-release preparations (26131). Urinary recovery of niacin and metabolites account for approximately 50% to 70% of the administered dose (26128, 26130).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin B3 includes niacin (nicotinic acid) and niacinamide (nicotinamide) (6243). Niacin is converted to niacinamide when ingested in amounts that do not exceed physiological requirements. When used in physiological amounts, the effects of niacin and niacinamide are indistinguishable. Niacin is water-soluble and well-absorbed when taken orally (505, 6243, 11694). Dietary sources include meats, beans, cereal grains, fish, and various niacin-fortified foods. In addition, some dietary tryptophan is converted to niacin in the body. Consumption of tryptophan 60 mg equals 1 mg of niacin or one niacin equivalent (2677, 6243). Niacin is a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These coenzymes are essential for oxidation-reduction reactions, ATP synthesis, and ADP-ribose transfer reactions (2677).\nAntibacterial effects\nEvidence from animal research and preliminary clinical research suggests that niacin can prevent fluid loss in patients with cholera by reversing cholera toxin-induced intestinal secretion (4868, 26119).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome research suggests niacin has cardioprotective effects while other research suggests the opposite. In patients with hyperlipidemia or peripheral arterial disease, niacin reduces fibrinogen concentrations in plasma and possibly stimulates fibrinolysis (4871, 8547). Evidence from animal research suggests that niacin helps preserve the myocardium following cardiac arrest and reperfusion by inhibiting beta-oxidation during preischemia and reperfusion, preventing the degradation of membrane phospholipids, reducing free fatty acid accumulation, and stimulating glycolysis (26120). Laboratory research suggests that niacin inhibits the formation of some cellular mediators in platelets, and increasing the production of others, resulting in an inhibition in platelet aggregation (26121). Increased production of some of these mediators plays a role in the visual flushing that occurs with niacin-induced vasodilation (6243). Despite the potential effects of niacin on vasodilation, any cardiovascular benefits of niacin do not appear to be related to improved endothelial or vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease or metabolic syndrome (93351, 93353). Additionally, metabolomics analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk who had participated in observational studies conducted in Europe and the United States suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors. Additionally, laboratory research on these identified metabolites shows that, at physiological levels, they elicit expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 on human vascular endothelial cells and enhanced leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelium (113554).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nThere is interest in using niacin for Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease itself, as well as treatment with levodopa, are associated with low plasma levels of niacin (107943, 107944). Preliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months increases niacin plasma levels; however, there is no association between niacin levels and changes in motor scores (107944). In addition, clinical research shows conflicting effects of supplemental niacin on Parkinson disease symptoms (107943, 107944).\nEndocrine effects\nNiacin can impair glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance (4863, 11692). The effects of niacin on triglyceride synthesis may also increase hepatic output of glucose by enhancing fatty acid utilization in the liver at the expense of glucose (4860, 11693, 26127).\nHypolipemic effects\nNiacin 1 gram daily or more can decrease total cholesterol by 8% to 21%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 8% to 25%, lipoprotein(a) by 23%, and triglycerides by 20% to 50%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations by 15% to 35% (8545, 96213). By binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor on adipocytes, niacin inhibits free fatty acid release from adipose tissue and inhibits cyclic AMP accumulation, which controls the activity of triglyceride lipase and hence lipolysis (26127). It also decreases the rate of liver synthesis of LDL and VLDL and increases the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma secondary to increased lipoprotein lipase activity (6243). Also, clinical research shows that niacin can reduce the number of VLDL particles, particularly the larger VLDL particles; increase the number of large but not small HDL particles; decrease the number of smaller, denser LDL particles; and increase the number of larger LDL particles (26123, 26124). In vitro research suggests that niacin increases HDL and apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 levels by reducing the uptake of HDL and apoA-1-containing HDL particles by liver cells, without affecting the removal of cholesterol ester-containing HDL particles (26122). The liver enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) plays a key role in the esterification of fatty acids to form triglycerides (26126). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that niacin reduces the synthesis of triglycerides by inhibiting the activity of DGAT2 (26125).\nNiacin deficiency\nNiacin deficiency causes pellagra, a condition characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia (2677, 6243). Pellagra was common in the early twentieth century, but niacin-fortified foods have virtually eliminated this disease in the West. It can be seen in patients with poor diet, chronic alcoholism, carcinoid tumors that decrease endogenous niacin production, and Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that interferes with tryptophan absorption (4850, 6243). Conditions that increase niacin requirements, such as hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, and lactation, can sometimes result in deficiency, but this is rare (4969). Some researchers think that sleep deprivation-induced dermatitis might be caused by niacin depletion because of similarities between this condition and pellagra (1350)."

Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study shows that applying niacinamide 4% gel twice daily for 8 weeks is as effective as clindamycin 1% gel for reducing the number and severity of acne lesions. The niacinamide gel appears to be more effective in patients with oily skin than those with non-oily skin (93360). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate acne vulgaris shows that applying niacinamide 5% cream twice daily, 10 minutes after applying benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel, for 12 weeks reduces the number of acne lesions, but not erythema or inflammation, when compared with benzoyl peroxide alone (107711).\n\nNiacinamide has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. In preliminary clinical research, oral niacinamide has been reported to improve acne when used in combination with zinc, copper, and folic acid (Nicomide) (25557), or in combination with azelaic acid, zinc, pyridoxine, copper, and folic acid (NicAzel, Elorac Inc.) (90800). In a small observational study, topical niacinamide 4% combined with gallic acid 1% and lauric acid 1% was associated with some improvement in acne (104931). It is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to niacinamide, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nDiabetes. Oral niacinamide does not seem to prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes, although it might slow its progression.\nAlthough some older research has suggested that taking high-dose niacinamide can reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes in high-risk children (4874), results from higher quality, more rigorous clinical trials show that taking niacinamide up to 3 grams daily for 5 years does not prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes (4875, 25553, 25554). However, taking niacinamide 1.2 grams/m2 daily for 5 years may prevent the loss of beta-cell function in these patients (25555). Also, there is evidence showing that niacinamide can preserve residual beta-cell function in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (4877, 4878, 4879, 4880, 25556). Clinical trials, including one placebo-controlled trial and one vitamin E-comparison study, show niacinamide can prolong the \"honeymoon period\" in those newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, when the pancreas is still capable of producing some insulin (4877, 4878, 4879, 4880, 25556). However, some scientists have raised concerns about potential induction of insulin resistance with short-term use of niacinamide 2 grams daily for 2 weeks (4881).\n\nNiacinamide has also been evaluated in adults with type 2 diabetes. A small clinical study in lean patients with type 2 diabetes who failed sulfonylurea therapy shows that taking niacinamide 500 mg three times daily for 6 months in addition to continuing insulin or a sulfonylurea increases C-peptide release and improves insulin secretion when compared with insulin alone (4882).\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. Adding oral niacinamide to standard treatment with phosphate binders further lowers blood levels of phosphorus in patients on hemodialysis.\nA meta-analysis of nine small clinical trials in patients on hemodialysis with hyperphosphatemia who are using a phosphate binder shows that taking niacinamide 250-1500 mg daily for 2-6 months lowers serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels when compared with placebo (98940) Another meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in the same patient population also shows that taking niacinamide, titrated from 500 mg to 1500 mg daily over 8 weeks, reduces serum phosphorus levels by about 0.9 mg/dL when compared with placebo (94188). Furthermore, a small, crossover clinical study in the same patient population shows that taking niacinamide (Nicotinamide, Orthica) 250 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 500 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce serum phosphate levels. However, in a per protocol analysis, serum phosphate levels were reduced by about 0.8 mg/dL when compared with placebo (116767). Other clinical research in this population shows that taking modified-release niacinamide 250-1500 mg orally daily for 12-24 weeks also lowers serum phosphate and parathyroid levels when compared with placebo. However, these effects were not maintained at 40-52 weeks follow-up (107709, 110499). In addition, this product was not compared with immediate-release niacinamide.\n\nNiacinamide has also been studied in place of phosphate binders. One small clinical study in patients on hemodialysis with hyperphosphatemia shows that taking niacinamide 500-1750 mg daily for 12 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after discontinuation of phosphate binders, decreases serum phosphorus levels by 1.5 mg/dL and intact parathyroid hormone levels by 50 pg/mL, without affecting calcium levels, when compared to baseline (25561).The validity of these findings is limited due to the lack of a control group.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral high-dose niacinamide might be beneficial for improving osteoarthritis symptoms.\nClinical research in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking niacinamide 3 grams daily in six divided doses for 12 weeks improves joint flexibility, reduces inflammation, and modestly decreases use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when compared with placebo (4883).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBrain tumor. Adding high-dose oral niacinamide to chemotherapy does not seem to improve survival in patients with brain tumors.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with surgically resected brain tumors shows that treatment with radiotherapy, niacinamide, and carbogen does not improve survival when compared with radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus carbogen (11695, 11696).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nActinic keratoses. It is unclear if oral or topical niacinamide is beneficial for reducing actinic keratoses. Research results are conflicting.\nA large clinical trial in healthy Australian adults with actinic keratoses shows that taking a specific niacinamide product (Insolar, Blackmores) 500 mg twice daily for 12 months reduces the number of actinic keratoses by 13% when compared with placebo. The difference between the 2 groups was observed as early as 3 months after starting niacinamide (93362). Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy, older Australian adults with actinic keratoses shows that taking niacinamide (Nature's Own, Virginia) 500 mg once or twice daily for 4 months reduces the total number of actinic keratoses by 29% and 35%, respectively, when compared with placebo (93365).\n\nHowever, a large clinical trial in solid organ transplant recipients in Australia shows that taking a specific niacinamide product (Insolar, Blackmores) 500 mg twice daily for 6 months does not reduce the number of actinic keratoses when compared with placebo (113559). Also, a small clinical trial in kidney transplant recipients with actinic keratoses and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer shows that taking niacinamide 500 mg twice daily for 12 months does not decrease the number of actinic keratoses when compared with placebo (113682). The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nTwo small clinical studies conducted in Brazil in elderly adults with actinic keratoses shows that taking niacinamide 500 mg twice daily for 120 days or applying a cream containing niacinamide 5% twice daily for 56 days does not reduce the number of actinic keratoses when compared with placebo (107714, 113684).\n\nMost studies were conducted in countries with high year-round ultraviolet radiation exposure, such as Australia and Brazil; results may not be readily extrapolated to populations in other geographic regions.\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. Although there is interest in using oral niacinamide for age-related cognitive decline, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacinamide for this purpose.\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with early-stage age-related maculopathy shows that taking a combination of niacinamide 18 mg, vitamin E 20 mg, and lutein 15 mg daily for nearly a year improves retinal function when compared with no treatment (60134). It is unclear if this effect is due to niacinamide, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAging skin. It is unclear if topical niacinamide improves symptoms of aging skin.\nA small study in females with signs of facial photo-aging shows that applying niacinamide 5% cream to half of the face twice daily for 12 weeks improves blotchiness, the appearance of wrinkles, skin elasticity, and skin pigmentation when compared with applying placebo cream to the other half of the face (25551).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral niacinamide is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).\nA small clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and a positive AD biomarker profile shows that taking niacinamide 1500 mg twice daily for 48 weeks does not improve cognitive or functional performance (116764).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical niacinamide improves eczema symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with atopic dermatitis and dry skin shows that applying niacinamide 2% cream twice daily for 8 weeks decreases skin water loss and improves skin hydration when compared with using a white petrolatum moisturizer (25560). A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild atopic dermatitis (AD) shows that applying a specific niacinamide containing body emollient (Bioderma Atoderm PP Baume, Bioderma Cosmetics Trading Co., Ltd.) 250 grams weekly, applied twice daily for 28 days with or without pre-cleansing with a specific niacinamide containing gel wash (Atoderm Intensive Gel Moussant, Bioderma Cosmetics Trading Co., Ltd.), improves AD severity, itching, trans-epidermal water loss, skin water content, and dermatological quality of life when compared with a control emollient and water-only skin cleansing. Additionally, using both the niacinamide containing emollient and cleansing gel improves trans-epidermal water loss and skin water content sooner when compared with niacin containing emollient only (113681). However, the study may have been inadequately powered and too short in duration to detect additional differences between the 2 niacinamide groups.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other vitamins; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with ADHD shows that taking a maximum of niacinamide 3 grams, ascorbic acid 3 grams, calcium pantothenate 1.2 grams, and pyridoxine 600 mg daily for 3 months seems to improve behavior in 29% of participants when compared with baseline (9957). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBladder cancer. Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with carbogen for improving survival in advanced bladder cancer; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA phase II clinical study in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer shows that adding inhaled carbogen and oral niacinamide 40-60 mg/kg about 2 hours before radiotherapy shows a trend to improved survival at 3 years when compared with inhaled carbogen and radiotherapy (25558), and a larger phase III study shows that carbogen and oral niacinamide improves 3-year survival by about 13% when compared with radiotherapy alone (93366). An observational follow-up of the phase III study found a trend to increased survival at 5 years in the carbogen and niacinamide group when compared with radiotherapy alone. And in a subgroup of patients with tumor necrosis, the 5-year survival was significantly greater with carbogen and niacinamide when compared with radiotherapy alone (93356). It is unclear if these effects are due to niacinamide, carbogen, or the combination.\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral niacinamide improves child growth.\nPreliminary clinical research in children in rural Tanzania shows that supplementing niacinamide orally from birth to 18 months of age does not improve length-for-age, weight-for-age, or head circumference when compared with control. Niacinamide was initially supplemented to breast-feeding mothers, 250 mg daily, until 6 months of age, followed by 100 mg daily taken by the child until 18 months of age (107713).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral niacinamide is beneficial for COVID-19.\nObservational research in adults with acute kidney injury secondary to coronavirus disease-19 infection has found that taking niacinamide 1000 mg orally daily for 7 days is associated with a 55% lower risk of mortality when compared with control. However, taking niacinamide was not associated with a lower risk of renal replacement therapy (110500).\nless\nCutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). It is unclear if topical niacinamide is beneficial for CLE.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with discoid lupus erythematosus, a type of CLE, shows that applying topical niacinamide 2% to 4% twice daily for 12 weeks modestly improves lesion scores, but not quality of life scores, when compared with placebo. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (110498).\nless\nDepression. Although there is interest in using oral niacinamide for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacinamide for this condition.\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy shows that taking a specific combination product (Cytoflavin, Polysan) containing niacinamide, inosine, riboflavin, and succinate daily for 12 weeks improves symptom scores, including paresthesia and numbness scores, when compared with placebo. The therapy was first administered intravenously, providing niacinamide 200 mg, inosine 400 mg, riboflavin 40 mg, and succinate 2000 mg daily for 10 days, followed by an oral formulation providing niacinamide 100 mg, inosine 200 mg, riboflavin 20 mg, and succinate 1200 mg daily for the remainder of the study (110503).\nless\nErythema. Topical niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThere is interest in using niacinamide to reduce the side effects of topical tretinoin, including erythema. A small preliminary clinical study in patients using isotretinoin for acne shows that applying a specific cream (Sebiaclear Hydra, SVr Laboratoire Dermatologique) containing niacinamide 5% and omega-ceramides 8% twice daily for 6 months reduces isotretinoin-induced erythema, dryness, and itching of the skin when compared with a glycerin placebo (98938). It is not clear if this effect is due to niacinamide, omega-ceramides, or the combination.\nless\nHead and neck cancer. Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with carbogen for improving survival in laryngeal cancer; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA phase III clinical trial in patients with laryngeal cancer shows that treatment with accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen and niacinamide 60 mg/kg taken orally 1-1.5 hours prior to each fraction of radiation improves local tumor control, but does not improve overall survival or 5-year disease-free survival, when compared with accelerated radiotherapy alone. In a subgroup of patients with hypoxic tumors, anemia, or high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, receiving niacinamide and carbogen seems to improve both survival and tumor control when compared with radiotherapy alone (93358, 93359, 93363).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral niacinamide is beneficial for lung cancer.\nA single-center clinical study in adults with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) taking a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib or erlotinib) shows that adding niacinamide 1000 mg daily for 24 months does not improve progression-free survival or overall survival when compared with placebo. However, a subgroup analysis suggests that taking niacinamide may increase overall survival by approximately 13 in females and patients that never smoked (116766).\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if topical niacinamide improves melasma.\nA small clinical study in female adults with melasma shows that applying a specific niacinamide 10% serum (Bo leda, Shanghai Ruizhi Medical Technology Co., Ltd) twice daily after skin cleansing for 16 weeks improves melasma area and severity, pigmented spots, and skin texture when compared with control. Both groups were also treated with salicylic acid 30% throughout the study (113683). A larger clinical study in adult females in China with melasma shows that applying a niacinamide 10% serum twice daily for 16 weeks in combination with salicylic acid 30% every 2 weeks improves melasma area and darkness when compared with placebo (116765). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to niacinamide, salicylic acid, or the combination.\n\nTopical niacinamide has also been studied in patients with hyperpigmentation. A small clinical study in Japanese females with uneven facial hyperpigmentation shows that applying niacinamide 5% moisturizer to the face twice daily reduces hyperpigmentation and increases skin lightness after 4 weeks when compared with placebo moisturizer. However, further improvements are not observed after another 4 weeks of treatment (25552). Another small clinical study in Korean females with uneven facial hyperpigmentation shows that applying a moisturizer containing niacinamide 2% plus tranexamic acid 2% (Regederm RX White Project, Aestura) twice daily for 8 weeks reduces skin pigmentation by about 9% when compared with a placebo cream (93361).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral niacinamide is beneficial for NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with NAFLD and diabetes shows that taking a specific niacinamide product (Nature's Life) 1000 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve liver function tests, liver steatosis, or liver fibrosis when compared with no intervention. However, some quality of life domain scores were moderately improved. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (110502).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if adding oral niacinamide to chemotherapy reduces relapses of refractory lymphoma.\nOne small clinical study in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma shows that 24% of patients achieve complete or partial remission and 57% achieve disease stabilization when compared with baseline, following treatment with vorinostat 400 mg daily and niacinamide titrated from 20 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg over the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle for up to 18 cycles (93355). It is unclear how these outcomes compare to using vorinostat alone, or to other control treatments.\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral or topical niacinamide reduces the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials in adults shows that taking niacinamide 500 mg twice daily for 4-12 months does not reduce the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer when compared with placebo. This analysis also shows no effect of niacinamide on the risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (113560). However, there was high heterogeneity across the studies due to differences in patient populations and mixed results overall.\n\nTwo studies included in the analysis show that niacinamide, including a specific niacinamide product (Nature's Own, Virginia), reduces the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in immunocompetent adults when compared with placebo (93362, 93365). One was a large clinical trial that shows taking a specific niacinamide product (Insolar, Blackmores) 500 mg twice daily for 12 months reduces the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancer by 23%, but it does not reduce the risk of not recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers, when compared with placebo. However, this reduced risk appears to be transient. Follow up 6 months after niacinamide was discontinued showed no difference between groups (93362). The 2 other studies analyzed, including a large trial using a specific niacinamide product (Insolar, Blackmores), were conducted in transplant recipients showed no reduced risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer when compared with placebo (113560, 113559). All studies were conducted in Australia; it is unclear if these results can be extrapolated to other geographical regions with different background ultraviolet radiation exposure and skin cancer rates.\n\nA previous meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies shows taking niacinamide 500-1000 mg daily for 6-12 months or applying niacinamide 1% twice daily for 6 months decreases the rate of basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas by 54% and 52%, respectively when compared with control. Niacinamide was only administered topically in 1 of the 5 studies and only reduced risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (110497).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there is interest in using oral niacinamide for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacinamide for this condition.\nPruritus. It is unclear if oral niacinamide reduces pruritus in patients with kidney failure.\nA small clinical study in patients with pruritus due to kidney failure shows that taking niacinamide sodium 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce pruritus severity when compared with placebo (93364). This study is limited due to small size and short study duration.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral niacinamide is beneficial for psoriasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate psoriasis shows that applying niacinamide 4% cream topically twice daily for 12 weeks improves psoriasis scores by 31% when compared with baseline. The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group (110501).\nless\nRosacea. Oral niacinamide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that 71% of adult and adolescent patients with rosacea who take a combination product (Nicomide) containing niacinamide 750 mg, zinc 25 mg, copper 1.5 mg, and folic acid 500 mcg once or twice daily report improvement in appearance after 4 weeks when compared to baseline (25557). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral niacinamide for schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacinamide for this condition.\nSeborrheic dermatitis. It is unclear if topical niacinamide is beneficial for reducing seborrheic dermatitis symptoms.\nOne small clinical study in patients with seborrheic dermatitis shows that applying niacinamide 4% cream once daily for 12 weeks reduces the severity of symptoms such as redness and scaling by 75%, compared with a 35% reduction when using a placebo cream (93357).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate niacinamide for these uses.",

In the liver, some NAD is hydrolyzed to release niacinamide for use by other tissues (6243). Niacinamide can also be deaminated in the intestinal tract by bacteria (6243).\nExcretion\nExcess niacinamide is excreted in the urine as derivatives (6243).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin B3 includes niacinamide and niacin (6243). Niacin is converted to niacinamide when ingested in amounts that exceed physiological requirements. When used in physiological amounts, the effects of niacin and niacinamide are indistinguishable. Niacin and niacinamide are water-soluble and well-absorbed when taken orally (505, 6243, 11694). Dietary sources include meats, beans, cereal grains, fish, and various niacin-fortified foods. Niacin and niacinamide are precursors of niacinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and niacinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are essential for oxidation-reduction reactions, ATP synthesis, and ADP-ribose transfer reactions (2677).\nAnti-cancer effects\nNiacinamide has been investigated as part of treatment for various types of cancers. In laboratory research, niacinamide appears to increase activation of p53, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression (93355). Additionally, niacinamide reduces tumor growth in mice with lung cancer (116766). Niacinamide also appears to improve blood flow to a bladder tumor when taken in combination with carbogen (98% oxygen and 2% carbon dioxide). Increased blood flow appears to reduce hypoxia and necrosis, possibly improving prognosis (93356, 93366). It has also been proposed that niacinamide may help protect against skin cancer. Niacinamide is a substrate for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NAD phosphate (NADP). These coenzymes provide energy to keratinocytes, thereby supporting DNA repair and reducing ultra-violet radiation damage (113560).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nNiacinamide is hypothesized to inhibit induction of nitric oxide synthase by interleukin 1 in chondrocytes, reducing inflammation and leading researchers to speculate about its potential use in destructive joint diseases (4884, 11694).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn doses of 1 gram or more daily, niacinamide can protect or improve beta-cell function, increasing insulin secretion (4875, 4880, 4881, 4882, 14512). Niacinamide prevents or delays insulin deficiency in laboratory models of type 1 diabetes (4873). However, limited research suggests that high doses of niacinamide might increase insulin resistance, although to a lesser extent than niacin (4881, 14512). Mechanisms of beta-cell protection by niacinamide might include inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase which is activated during toxin-induced beta-cell damage, scavenging of oxygen radicals and nitric oxide which cause cell lysis, restoration of intracellular NAD pools, alteration of autoimmune processes including reducing expression of major histocompatibility complex class II and gamma-interferon-induced intracellular adhesion molecule 1 on endothelial cells, and blocking the effects of interleukin-1 (4873, 4881, 14512).\nCardiovascular effects\nAt pharmacologic doses, more than 300-800 mg/daily, the effects of niacin and niacinamide differ. Unlike niacin, niacinamide has no beneficial effect on lipids and should not be used for treating hyperlipidemia (6243). Niacinamide does not cause the vasodilatation associated with niacin (6243).\nDermatologic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that niacinamide reduces skin pigmentation by inhibiting the transfer of melanosome from melanocytes to the keratinocyte skin cells (93361). Clinical research also suggests that niacinamide reduces skin pigmentation. Small clinical studies show that applying niacinamide 5% moisturizer to the face or applying a moisturizer containing niacinamide 2% plus tranexamic acid 2% twice daily reduces hyperpigmentation and increases skin lightness in Japanese or Korean females with facial hyperpigmentation (25552, 93361).\nElectrolyte effects\nNiacinamide reduces intestinal expression of sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter-2b (NaPiIIb), which is responsible for most phosphate absorption. NaPiIIb expression is increased in patients taking phosphate binders; therefore, there is interest in using niacinamide to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients on hemodialysis. Preliminary clinical research shows that niacinamide may reduce serum phosphate levels in patients on hemodialysis, with or without concomitant use of a phosphate binder (25561, 98940, 94188, 107709).\nNeurological effects\nAnimal research suggests that niacinamide reduces phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (amyloid-β) leading to disease-modifying potential in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, clinical research shows that taking niacinamide does not reduce cerebral spinal fluid p-tau or amyloid-β when compared with placebo in patients with mild cognitive decline or mild dementia and a positive AD biomarker profile (116764).\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using niacinamide to increase niacinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, which may be neuroprotective and support retinal and optical nerve recovery. Preliminary research in adults with open-angle glaucoma and optic neuropathy shows that taking niacinamide and pyruvate orally, titrated to 3000 mg of each, daily for 3 weeks increases the odds of pointwise improvement in visual function by 3.2-fold when compared with placebo. However, global visual field index and retinal nerve fiber thickness were not improved (107708).\nRadiosensitizing effects\nPreliminary data suggest very high doses of niacinamide (3-6.5 grams/daily) may have radiosensitizing effects. These doses might reduce the closure of blood vessels in tumors which makes them hypoxic and resistant to radiotherapy (11695, 11696, 11697, 25559).\nRenal effects\nThere is interest in using niacinamide to reduce serum levels of carbamylated albumin. Carbamylated albumin levels are elevated in patients with kidney failure and are associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, preliminary clinical research in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking niacinamide orally 500-2000 mg daily for 24 weeks does not reduce carbamylated albumin levels when compared with sevelamer or baseline (107710).\nSkeletomuscular effects\nThere is interest in using niacinamide to prevent or treat sarcopenia. Preliminary clinical research in older adults with impaired physical functioning shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement containing niacinamide 200 mg, nicotinic acid 4 mg, and tryptophan 210 mg daily for 28 days does not increase skeletal muscle levels of niacinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or improve markers of mitochondrial or skeletal muscle function when compared with control (107712)."

            "Overview": "Nickel is a hard, bright, silver-white metal that is found in soil, water, and various foods, including cocoa and chocolate, nuts, dried beans, fruits, vegetables, seeds, shellfish, salmon, hydrogenated shortenings, eggs, and milk. Drinking water and food are the main sources of nickel exposure, with the average American diet containing about 300 mcg daily (16334, 64992). Nickel is commonly included in vitamin supplements as a trace element.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Nickel is safe for most adults when used in doses less than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1 mg daily (7135).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses and for prolonged periods. Taking nickel in doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1 mg daily increases the chance of adverse effects (7135). Taking high doses of nickel is associated with acute toxicity. Prolonged industrial exposure to nickel is also associated with hypersensitivity disorders, lung disorders, and cancer (7135, 16307, 16311).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Nickel is safe in children when used in daily doses less than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 0.2 mg daily in children 1-3 years, 0.3 mg daily in children 4-8 years, and 0.6 mg daily in children 9-13 years (7135).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses.

Nickel is safe to use during pregnancy and lactation in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1 mg daily (7135). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of nickel when taken in doses above the UL during pregnancy and lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, nickel is well tolerated when taken in amounts found in foods, which are typically below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). However, doses above the UL can cause serious adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nAll routes of administration: Contact dermatitis.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Chronic consumption of large quantities of nickel might increase the risk of cancers of the lung, nose, larynx, and prostate.\nCardiovascular\nParticulate matter-associated nickel exposures have been associated with cardiopulmonary diseases (65021). Nickel exposure may also cause variable degrees of cardiovascular system poisoning (16333). In one case report, a 45-year-old male developed leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, dyspnea, and fatigue after implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient eventually developed fulminant hypereosinophilia and eosinophilic myocarditis, resulting in cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. After the patient had been medically stabilized, the ICD was removed, leading to symptom resolution (99670).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally and topically, nickel can cause dermatitis and other hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized individuals (65045). Nickel exposure may cause systemic contact dermatitis (65017). Orally, nickel sulfate has been associated with classic systemic allergic contact eczema (64916). Topical exposure can occur from the use of common equipment containing nickel. There are at least four case reports of allergic contact dermatitis of the hand due to the use of a nickel-containing electronic cigarette device. Patients with nickel allergy should be advised to avoid devices that contain nickel (99665, 99669). There is also a case report of a 21-year-old female who developed recurrent rash on her upper chest and thighs due to exposure to nickel via weightlifting equipment at her gym (99671).\n\n\"Nickel itch\" may occur up to seven days before skin eruption occurs. The primary skin eruption is follicular, which may be followed by skin ulceration. Nickel may cause Baboon syndrome, characterized by a clinical presentation of systemic contact dermatitis with a pruritic and confluent maculopapular, light red eruption, localized in the gluteal area and the major flexures and developing several hours or days after nickel contact (64963, 65092).\n\nIndividuals with mutations in the filaggrin gene may be especially susceptible to hand eczema caused by additive effects from irritants and nickel exposure (65012). Nickel exposure may lead to cross-sensitivity dermatitis reaction in individuals who are allergic to other metals, especially palladium, cobalt, and aluminum (65023, 64939, 65099, 65028, 64968, 65026).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, consuming high doses of nickel 0.5-2.5 grams has been reported to cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Patients with systemic nickel allergy syndrome (SNAS) can experience colic and diarrhea after consumption of nickel-rich foods (99663).\nless\nGenitourinary\nNickel has been shown to cross the placenta and to have embryotoxic and teratogenic properties (65068, 65091). Nickel may upset the hormonal balance of the mother and may impair development of the preimplantation embryo (65061).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, nickel has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity (65009).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally and topically, nickel can cause hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized individuals (64916, 65017, 65045). Nickel sensitivity, which can cause dermatologic and gastrointestinal symptoms, has an estimated prevalence of 11% in the general population, with a higher overall incidence in females than in males (99668). About 10% of nickel-sensitive people react to ingestion of 550-1300 mcg. Nickel sensitivity, once acquired, may persist indefinitely (64994). Some clinical research suggests that daily consumption of nickel 30 ng, 0.3 mcg, or 1.5 mcg for one year can hyposensitize individuals and reduce symptoms of nickel sensitivity (99663).\n\nIn sensitive individuals, dermal or systemic exposure to nickel can induce a type I immediate (anaphylactic) reaction and a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by secreted cytokines and allergen-specific T lymphocytes (64989, 65002). Nickel exposure may cause a cross-sensitivity reaction in individuals who are allergic to other metals, especially palladium, cobalt, and aluminum (65023, 64939, 65099, 65028, 64968, 65026).\n\nImplantation of devices containing nickel have been reported to cause localized and systemic reactions. A 59-year-old male with a hip arthroplasty, who later tested positive for nickel allergy, experienced hip pain, aseptic implant loosening, and contact allergic dermatitis in the inguinal regions, necessitating multiple surgeries (99664). In another case, a 45-year-old male developed leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, dyspnea, fatigue, and edema immediately and during the two months after implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient eventually developed fulminant hypereosinophilia and eosinophilic myocarditis, resulting in cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. Once the patient was stabilized, the ICD was removed and all symptoms resolved. The patient tested positive for nickel allergy (99670).\n\nThere have been at least two case reports of hypersensitivity reactions to the nickel contained in implanted cardiac rings. One 57-year-old male experienced severe urticaria and angioedema two weeks after implantation of a mitral valve annuloplasty ring. The patient tested positive for nickel allergy and, although there was no evidence of nickel in his blood, symptoms resolved upon removal of the nickel-containing ring (99667). A 56-year-old male experienced persistent urticarial rash and multiple episodes of anaphylactic shock within the first month after implantation of a mitral ring. The patient tested positive to nickel upon skin prick testing; symptoms resolved after removal of the mitral ring (99666).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, consuming large quantities of nickel can lead to acute nickel toxicity, which may cause cerebral edema (16334).\nless\nOncologic\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified nickel compounds as carcinogenic to humans (65046). Occupational exposure to nickel and nickel compounds in nickel refining, cutlery factories, and alkaline battery manufacturing plants is associated with an increased incidence of lung, bronchial, and nasal cancers (39918, 65029, 16334, 65056, 64962, 65075, 64912, 65006, 64974). It is unclear if one specific lung cancer cell type is associated with nickel exposure (65054). Nickel fumes present in nickel and some steel refineries are associated with undifferentiated and squamous histologies of the nose and paranasal sinuses (65040, 65050, 65101, 64898, 65093, 64909, 64984, 65031, 64969). Occupational changes in industrial processes that have eliminated or reduced exposures to nickel compounds have reduced the risk of lung cancer (64966); however, experts believe that further preventive measures are needed to decrease or eliminate occupational nickel exposure time (65010). Exposure to nickel concentrate or metallic nickel through the metallurgical refining process has not been associated with an increase in respiratory cancer risk (64918).\n\nAlthough clinical and epidemiologic research show that sparingly soluble nickel compounds, and possibly also soluble nickel compounds, may be linked to an increased risk for lung and nasal cancers, there is conflicting evidence as to whether inhalation exposure to soluble nickel alone is carcinogenic (42782, 64940). According to some researchers, these opposing positions may be resolved by the hypothesis that high concentrations of inhaled nickel may induce chronic lung inflammation, enhancing carcinogenic risks associated with inhalation exposure to other substances (64938). Therefore, it has been suggested that if exposures are kept below levels that cause chronic respiratory toxicity, carcinogenic effects may be avoided.\n\nThere is concern that exposure to nickel in conjunction with another metal might increase the risk for certain forms of cancer. In the art glass industry, an association was found between an increased risk for stomach cancer and the use of a mixture of arsenic, copper, nickel, and manganese (65086). Based on epidemiological data and genotoxicity testing, the combination of nickel and chromium in the fumes from the welding of stainless and high alloy steels may contribute to an additive risk of respiratory tract cancer (65064). Additionally, co-exposure to nickel and cadmium may increase the risk of lung cancer (64945).\n\nEpidemiological studies that have found an association between nickel and an increased risk for cancer might be confounded by the presence of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure (65087, 65106). Nickel occurs in mainstream cigarette smoke in the range of 0-0.51 mg per cigarette (65096). The high prevalence of prostate cancer in smokers may be related to the nickel in cigarettes (65109).\n\nImplantation of nickel-containing hardware has also been reported to induce the development of cancer (64913, 65032, 65039). In one case, a 65-year-old female developed osteogenic sarcoma at the site of a nail that had been implanted for nine years for fixation of a femoral neck fracture. A concentration of 14 ppm of nickel was detected within the tumor tissue, indicating neoplastic induction by nickel (65032). In a different case, a malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone developed 20 years after a femoral fracture treated by plate-screw fixation. Nickel was present in the tumor tissue, indicating the metabolism of corrosion products (64913).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nInhalation of nickel carbonyl has been reported to cause nickel toxicity, including pulmonary edema, acute tracheobronchitis, or diffuse interstitial pneumonitis (16334, 64905, 61495).\n\nOccupational exposure to nickel has been reported to cause chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, airway narrowing, asthma, bronchitis, reduced lung function, lung fibrosis, nasal polyposis, perforation of the nasal septum, and cancer of the lungs and nasal sinuses (65045, 64933, 65077). Bronchiolitis induced by nickel and nitric acid have also been reported (64948).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, nickel has been reported to cause nephrotoxicity (16333, 65009), especially when consumed in excessive amounts (65104).\nless\nOther\nOrally, nickel toxicity can occur after the consumption of large quantities of nickel. The level of toxicity caused by nickel exposure seems to depend on its chemical form. Insoluble nickel compounds, including metallic nickel, nickel sulfides, and nickel oxides, seem to have a higher carcinogenic potential than water-soluble nickel salts (chloride, nitrate, sulfate) (64902). Conversely, it has been reported that nickel compounds, other than nickel carbonyl, are essentially nontoxic after ingestion due to their low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (65052).\n\nThe treatment of nickel toxicity is not well studied. In some reports, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, may protect against nickel toxicity (65009, 64991). Chelating drugs have been used as an antidote in nickel poisoning (65045, 64979). Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and disulfiram have also been proposed as effective nickel chelators in the treatment of acute nickel carbonyl poisoning; however, adequate clinical studies are not available to assess the effectiveness of these options (65003).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbsorption of nickel by the body is affected by several factors, including quantity, gut acidity, and the presence of binding or competing substances, including other minerals (i.e., iron, magnesium, zinc, and calcium) (65009). Pulmonary absorption is a major route of concern for nickel-induced toxicity. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), humans and animals absorb about 1% to 10% of the nickel in the diet and 20% to 35% of inhaled nickel into the blood. Though nickel is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, most nickel intake occurs through dietary exposure or drinking water (65009).\n\nTopical application of nickel compounds in vivo or in vitro to human skin results in minimal absorption. After 24 hours, 98% of nickel remained on the skin surface or was adsorbed in the uppermost layers of the stratum corneum, although some appeared to penetrate beyond the stratum corneum to a minor degree (64924). In vitro, only 1% of nickel nitrate penetrated beyond the stratum corneum, and the stratum corneum on the arm was more penetrable to nickel than that of the back (64924).\nDistribution\nMost plasma nickel is bound to the circulating proteins nickeloplasmin and albumin. The mean serum nickel concentration in humans is less than 0.3 mcg/L, with an upper limit of 1.1 mcg/L. The mean nickel concentration in the urine is 2 mcg/L, with an upper limit of 6 mcg/L (65079). Reference values for serum and urine nickel concentrations in healthy adults are 0.2 mcg/L and 1-3 mcg/L, respectively (65009). A typical 70 kg man contains approximately 10 mg of nickel, with an average body concentration of 0.1 ppm (65009).\n\nBoth soluble and insoluble nickel particles enter cells. Water-insoluble nickel compounds have been shown to enter cells by phagocytosis and are contained in cytoplasmic vacuoles (64978).\nExcretion\nIn humans, excretion of nickel in the feces is about 100 times that of urinary excretion (65009).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNickel is a trace element that is essential for bacteria, plants, and mammals (63509, 16336, 64999, 64935). It is estimated that the human body contains approximately 10 mg of nickel. Nickel is a component of many enzymes, including ureases (64903, 65036) and sometimes superoxide dismutase (65020). It is involved in the transport of oxygen in the blood and in the production and action of adrenaline, noradrenaline, prolactin, and aldosterone. It also affects membrane properties and oxidation and reduction systems (65030, 64910).\n\nNickel is a hard, bright, silver-white metal that is found in soil, water, and multiple food sources. Common food sources include cocoa and chocolate, nuts, dried beans, peas, soya beans, spinach, lettuce, oatmeal, grains, fruits, other vegetables and leguminous seeds, shellfish, salmon, hydrogenated shortenings, eggs, and milk. Drinking water and food are the main sources of nickel exposure (16334, 64992).\n\nDietary nickel is variable, averaging about 200-300 mcg daily (42190, 16310, 65062). The average nickel intake from the Danish diet is estimated to be 150 mcg daily, which comes predominantly from roots and vegetables, grains, and bread (42192).\n\nBaking powder and cocoa powder may contain excessive amounts of nickel due to nickel leaching during the manufacturing process. Consumption of these items in larger amounts may increase nickel intake to 900 mcg daily or more. Soft drinking water, which contains fewer dissolved minerals than hard water, and acidic beverages may dissolve nickel from pipes and containers (42190). Nickel exposures may result from tobacco, dental implants, and contact with stainless steel kitchen utensils, stainless steel and nickel-plated articles, and inexpensive jewelry (65052, 65044). Leaching or corrosion may contribute to attaining an oral nickel intake of up to 1 mg daily, which is equivalent to the tolerable upper intake level for nickel in adults (42190).\nCarcinogenic effects\nNickel has been shown to activate apoptotic pathways, which may be the mechanism behind nickel-induced hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, autoimmunity, and carcinogenesis (65007, 64954). Chronic exposure to nickel compounds is associated with respiratory cancer in humans and induces tumors in experimental animals (16328, 64906, 64896). Nickel-induced carcinogenesis has been reviewed in a number of publications (65072, 65085, 65066, 64997, 65027, 65051, 65011, 65047, 64988, 64953, 64911, 65041, 64931, 65058, 65004, 65065, 65038, 65025, 64982, 65014, 64981, 64941, 64926, 63557). Nickel carcinogenesis may involve the formation of specific metal complexes, chromosomal damage, and activation of signal transduction pathways promoting survival and expansion of genetically or epigenetically altered cells (64996, 16325).\n\nParticulate nickel compounds have been shown to enter the cell via phagocytosis, dissolve inside the cell, and trigger oxidative stress (64932). When high levels of nickel accumulate intracellularly, nickel binds to and enters the nucleus and interacts with major chromatin components, including DNA, histones, and protamines (64936, 64943). Nickel has been found to selectively damage heterochromatin and to silence the expression of genes located near heterochromatin by inducing a loss of histone H4 and H3 acetylation and DNA hypermethylation (64944). Nickel ions may enhance the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and activate protein kinase C, as well as induce the production of stress proteins (65071). In this way, it has been shown that nickel compounds primarily affect cancer initiation, although there is evidence that nickel compounds may also have promoting properties (65059, 64961).\n\nNickel induces both a variety of signaling pathways and genes that seem to be important for the survival of cancer cells. Nickel may alter the levels of transcription factors, such as ATF-1, p53, HIF-1, HIF-1alpha, and NF-kappaB (64907, 64919).\n\nNickel has been shown to interfere with DNA repair systems, leading to a diminished removal of endogenous DNA lesions that may increase the risk of tumor formation (64895). Co-exposure to nickel and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), which may occur in cigarette smoke and at many workplaces, may be additively carcinogenic, because nickel impairs the removal of B[a]P-derived DNA adducts (64928). Nickel has also been shown to act as a co-carcinogen by enhancing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of UV light, X-rays, and cytostatic agents like cis-platinum, trans-platinum, and mitomycin C (65090, 65089).\n\nOther mechanisms that may be involved in nickel-induced carcinogenesis include lipid peroxidation, which induces DNA-strand gaps and breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (65104). Nickel has been reported to cause chromosome damage both in vitro and in vivo (65087). Binding of nickel ions to DNA and nuclear proteins may induce DNA strand breaks and crosslinks, infidelity of DNA replication, inhibition of DNA repair, and the helical transition of B-DNA to Z-DNA. Nickel may replace zinc in finger-loop domains of transforming proteins, and it has been reported to enhance tumor progression by inhibiting NK cell activity (64917, 64980, 64928, 65035).\nEpigenetic effects\nNickel has been found to modulate gene expression by induction of DNA methylation and/or suppression of histone acetylation, leading to epigenetic silencing or reactivation of gene expression (64942, 65018, 64960, 64935). Molecular modeling has identified a nickel binding site in histone H4 (64936). It has been proposed that nickel causes nucleobase oxidation and sequence-specific histone hydrolysis, which may be inhibited by high levels of glutathione (64901). In vitro, a short-term exposure of cells to crystalline nickel particles, or a long-term exposure to soluble NiCl2, epigenetically silenced target genes placed near heterochromatin (64978).\nHypoxic effects\nNickel has been shown to activate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway; HIF-1 induction induces the expression of a variety of genes that will allow cells to survive a lack of oxygen, allowing a previously initiated cancer cell to progress and metastasize (64958, 64944). It has been suggested that soluble and insoluble nickel compounds activate hypoxia-signaling pathways by blocking iron uptake, therefore inhibiting a variety of iron-dependent enzymes (64978). Similar to hypoxia, nickel has been shown to decrease histone acetylation and increase the methylation of H3 lysine 9, which are involved in gene silencing (64978). In vitro, nickel caused enhanced transcription of the erythropoietin gene (65110, 65102).\n\nDepletion of intracellular ascorbate caused by nickel has been shown to inhibit cellular hydroxylases, manifested by the loss of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and -2alpha hydroxylation and hypoxia-like stress (16328).\nImmune effects\nIn sensitive individuals, dermal or systemic exposure to nickel can induce a type I immediate (anaphylactic) reaction and type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by secreted cytokines and allergen-specific T lymphocytes (64989, 65002).\n\nNickel has been shown to induce allergic reactions in several ways (65049, 65084, 65098). It may bind to a carrier protein in the extracellular space that is presented by antigen presenting cells (such as Langerhans cells) in the context of MHC class II molecules, resulting in activation of CD4+ lymphocytes (65001, 64998). Alternately, nickel may enter a cell, bind to intracellular proteins that are presented in the context of MHC class I molecules, resulting in activation of CD8+ lymphocytes. Nickel may also bridge MHC molecules together with the TCR receptor on lymphocytes without actually filling the antigen-binding site (65001).\n\nInterleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and interferon-gamma are involved in the development of contact allergy to nickel. In dyshidrotic eczema caused by nickel sensitivity, skin lesions are mediated by inflammatory lymphocytes (64951). In patients with nickel sensitivity due to use of fixed orthodontic appliances, there was a known nickel-induced type 2 immune response and a marked lack of type 1 immunity (64947).\n\nIn nonallergic individuals, the lack of circulating CD8+ T cells reactive to nickel, as well as the absence of inflammatory responses at the site of skin exposure to the metal, has been shown to be the consequence of the expansion of specialized T cells with regulatory function (64973, 64946). Among these, CD4(+)CD25+ T cells from peripheral blood of nonallergic subjects strongly regulate immune responses to nickel in a cytokine-independent, cell contact-dependent mechanism. In contrast, CD4(+)CD25+ obtained from the blood of nickel-allergic individuals exhibited limited or absent suppressive activity on specific T cell responses in vitro (64973).\n\nClinical research shows that daily consumption of nickel 30 ng, 0.3 mcg, or 1.5 mcg for one year can hyposensitize individuals and reduce symptoms of nickel sensitivity (99663). It has been suggested that the acquisition of nickel tolerance is possibly dependent on IL-10 secretion by specific lymphocytes (65001).\nInflammatory effects\nNickel exposure has been shown to promote the formation of free radicals (64983). Nickel has been shown to deplete glutathione and protein-bound sulfhydryl groups, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide ions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals (65071). Increased ROS has been found to lead to enhanced lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and altered calcium and sulfhydryl homeostasis (65070). Nickel may also decrease cellular antioxidative defense systems (64896) and may stimulate phagocytic cells to produce ROS (65071). The ability to generate ROS by redox cycling quinones and related compounds may require nickel ions. It has been proposed that inhalation of nickel may lead to chronic generation of ROS concomitant with chronic inflammation, which may modulate transcription factors responsible for proliferation, differentiation, and carcinogenesis (64904). Particulate nickel compounds have been shown to produce more oxidative stress than water-soluble nickel compounds (64932)."

            "Overview": "Nicotinamide riboside is a member of the vitamin B3 family which also includes niacin and niacinamide (nicotinamide). The body converts nicotinamide riboside to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is a vital component for many cellular processes in the body (94746, 94748, 98015, 98016). Nicotinamide riboside was first identified as a precursor to NAD+ by researchers Rowen and Kornberg in 1951 (98014, 98017).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when nicotinamide riboside chloride is used orally and appropriately. The European Food Safety Authority has set a tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 300 mg daily for nicotinamide riboside chloride (104937, 107706). In clinical research, higher doses have been used for up to 12 weeks (110504, 110506). A specific nicotinamide riboside branded ingredient (Niagen, ChromaDex) has been used with apparent safety at higher doses for varying durations, including 500 mg daily for up to 22 months (110623); 1000 mg once or twice daily for up to 12 weeks (94744, 94745, 94746, 102035, 111558, 113555, 116104) and 3000 mg daily for 4 weeks (113557).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when nicotinamide riboside chloride is used orally and appropriately. The European Food Safety Authority has determined that taking nicotinamide riboside chloride in doses of up to 230 mg daily is safe when pregnant or breastfeeding (104937, 107706).",

Some patients taking this specific nicotinamide riboside product in another clinical trial have reported mild muscle pain or soreness (102035). In one safety study of adults with Parkinson disease, Niagen (ChromaDex) was associated with reports of muscle cramps, tremor, and fatigue; however, it is unclear if these events were related to Parkinson disease or the treatment (113557).\nless",

It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside is beneficial for improving cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\nA very small clinical study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc) 250 mg daily for 1 week, 500 mg daily for another week, 750 mg daily for the third week, and 1000 mg daily for the next 7 weeks does not improve measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo (113555). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to a detect difference between groups. A separate small crossover study in the same population shows that taking this same nicotinamide riboside product as 1 gram daily for 8 weeks does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (116104).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there is interest in using oral nicotinamide riboside for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of nicotinamide riboside for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. Oral nicotinamide riboside has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease in Turkey shows that taking a combination product containing nicotinamide riboside 1 g, N-acetyl cysteine 2.55 g, L-serine 12.35 g, and L-carnitine tartrate 3.73 g once daily for 28 days, followed by twice daily for another 56 days, does not improve scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis suggests that taking this product may modestly improve cognitive function in adults with greater cognitive impairment at baseline when compared with placebo (110623). It is unclear if any effect is due to nicotinamide riboside, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAtaxia telangiectasia. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves ataxia telangiectasia.\nA small, open-label, single-arm study in adults and children with ataxia telangiectasia shows that taking nicotinamide riboside orally 25 mg/kg daily for 4 months improves ataxia scores by 11% to 17% when compared to baseline. Ataxia scores also worsened after treatment withdrawal (107703). Another small, open-label, single-arm study in a similar population suggests that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc) 150 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 300 mg daily for 2 months, and then 500 mg daily for 22 months modestly improves overall neuromotor functioning and coordination when compared to baseline (113556). The validity of these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves athletic performance in healthy adults.\nOne small study in young, healthy males shows that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (NAD+ Cell Regenerator, Life Extension) 500 mg two hours before exercise does not improve measures of muscle strength, muscle fatigue, or oxygen consumption when compared with placebo (102036). Given the small sample size, this study is limited by a lack of adequate power to detect significant differences between groups.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside can improve kidney function or exercise endurance in adults with CKD.\nA small crossover study in adults 50 years and older with CKD shows that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc) 1000 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve biomarkers of kidney function or measures of exercise endurance when compared with placebo (111558). The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDiabetes. Although there is interest in using oral nicotinamide riboside for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of nicotinamide riboside for this condition.\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside is beneficial for heart failure.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with heart failure and a left ventricle ejection fraction of less than 40% shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 250 mg orally twice daily, titrated weekly by 250 mg to a final dose of 1000 mg orally twice daily, for 12 weeks does not improve 6-minute walk test distance or quality of life scores when compared with placebo. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (110506).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves lipid levels.\nOne small clinical study in sedentary males with obesity and elevated blood lipids shows that taking nicotinamide riboside (Niagen, ChromaDex) 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (94745).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside reduces blood pressure.\nOne small clinical study in patients with and without hypertension shows that taking nicotinamide riboside (Niagen, ChromaDex) 500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks non-significantly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by around 4 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. The effect seems to be more pronounced in patients with elevated blood pressure at baseline (94744).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral nicotinamide riboside has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with NAFLD shows that taking a combination product containing nicotinamide riboside 125 mg and pterostilbene 25 mg (Basis, Elysium Health), 2-4 tablets orally daily for 26 weeks does not improve liver function test levels or liver fat content when compared with placebo (110508).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves weight loss.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with obesity shows that taking nicotinamide riboside (Niagen, ChromaDex) 1000 mg once or twice daily for 6-12 weeks does not reduce body weight or improve insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, or lipid levels when compared with placebo (94745, 104935).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves symptoms of Parkinson disease.\nA small clinical study in adults with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 500 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve Parkinson disease severity scores when compared with placebo (110504). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Conversely, a separate very small, exploratory safety study in adults with Parkinson disease suggests that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (Tru Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc) 1500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves disease severity scores when compared with placebo. However, at the time of final symptom evaluation, people in the placebo group had a longer average time since their last levodopa dose when compared with those in the treatment group, which may have impacted symptom severity (113557).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside is beneficial for PAD.\nA clinical study in adults with lower extremity PAD shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 500 mg twice daily for 6 months does not improve the distance walked during the 6-minute walk test when compared with placebo (116106). The validity of these findings is limited by unclear and inconsistent reporting.\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral nicotinamide riboside improves physical performance in older adults.\nOne small clinical study in healthy, elderly males shows that taking a specific nicotinamide riboside product (NAD+ Cell Regenerator, Life Extension) 500 mg two hours before exercise seems to improve some measures of muscle strength and fatigue, but not oxygen consumption, when compared with placebo. Additionally, muscle strength, as measured by isometric peak torque, was improved in these older patients when compared with younger males taking the same product (102036).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate nicotinamide riboside for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with nicotinamide riboside.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nNicotinamide riboside is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Oral administration of nicotinamide riboside leads to notable, dose-dependent increases in blood NAD+ levels, suggesting that nicotinamide riboside is bioavailable when taken orally (94746, 94748, 102035). After oral intake, the time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of nicotinamide riboside is about 3 hours (94746).\nMetabolism\nNicotinamide riboside is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by the nicotinamide ribose kinases NRK1 and NRK2. These enzymes phosphorylate nicotinamide riboside (94750, 98015). Oral administration of nicotinamide riboside leads to increases in blood levels of NMN and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) (113555, 113557). Nicotinamide riboside is also converted to niacinamide (nicotinamide) by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Both pathways contribute to the NAD+ metabolome (94744, 94748, 98015). Nicotinamide riboside is also converted to niacinamide by intestinal bacteria (107706).\nExcretion\nNicotinamide riboside has an elimination half-life of 2.7 hours (94746). After oral intake, various metabolites are detected in the urine, including nicotinic acid riboside, nicotinamide, and the nicotinamide breakdown products nicotinamide N-oxide, 1-methyl nicotinamide, and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (113557).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNicotinamide riboside is a pyridine-nucleoside member of the vitamin B3 family. It is present in trace amounts in unprocessed foods, including green vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs, meat, and poultry (94748, 98013, 98016). It is also found in cow's milk at a concentration of 4.3 mcmol/L, accounting for around 40% of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor vitamins present in cow's milk (98012).\n\nThe primary mechanism by which nicotinamide riboside is thought to exert beneficial physiological effects is by enhancing the production of NAD+. Nicotinamide riboside is a precursor of NAD+, and oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside results in dose-dependent increases in NAD+ levels (98015, 107706). NAD+ is an important component of a variety of cellular and metabolic processes. It is well established that NAD+ levels decline over time and that diminished NAD+ levels contribute to age-related diseases. Thus, replenishing the NAD+ pool through supplementation with nicotinamide riboside is thought to improve symptoms and/or delay the progression of these conditions (98015).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research shows that administration of nicotinamide riboside decreases oxidative stress and prevents organ injury and death in a mouse model of sepsis. These effects are thought to be the result of enhanced NAD+/SIRT1 signaling, which inhibits oxidative stress and limits the release of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a protein associated with organ injury in sepsis patients (102044).\nCancer effects\nThere is interest in the role of NAD+ in tumor development and metastasis. Animal research in mice shows that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside increases tumor development and brain metastasis when compared with control (110509).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome animal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can stabilize levels of NAD+ in myocardial tissue and slow the progression to heart failure in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that nicotinamide riboside might be useful in the treatment and prevention of heart failure (102039).\nErgogenic effects\nSome animal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can increase endurance and improve muscle and mitochondrial function. This is theorized to be due to an increase in NAD+ concentrations, which in turn increases the activity of NAD+-dependent SIRT1 and SIRT3 deacetylases (98013, 98016). However, research in healthy adults shows that taking nicotinamide riboside orally does not seem to increase SIRT1 or SIRT3 activity or improve mitochondrial signaling (104936). There may be age-related differences in effects. In older, but not younger, patients nicotinamide riboside supplementation decreases oxidative stress and improves some measures of muscle strength and fatigue during exercise (102036). Nicotinamide riboside may help prevent age-related decline in strength and physical functioning.\n\nThere may be age- or condition-related differences in effects. In older, but not younger, patients, nicotinamide riboside supplementation decreases oxidative stress and improves some measures of muscle strength and fatigue during exercise (102036). Clinical research in adults with chronic kidney disease shows that taking nicotinamide riboside decreases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates isocitrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate and increases glutamate, which suggests improved mitochondrial metabolism; however, it did not improve most measures of exercise tolerance after 6 weeks (111558).\nHepatic effects\nSome animal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can reduce hepatic steatosis, improve hepatic cholesterol, reduce hepatic fibrosis, improve liver regeneration, reduce hepatic stress and inflammation, and prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in mouse models of liver disease (98011, 98016, 102041). This research suggests that nicotinamide riboside has therapeutic potential in a variety of liver conditions. While the exact mechanism of these effects is unclear, researchers suggest that increased NAD+ concentrations from nicotinamide riboside supplementation likely explain the findings. However, other research in obese mice shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 400 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks does not improve hepatic steatosis when compared with control (110505).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using nicotinamide riboside to treat or prevent metabolic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, but research is conflicting. Some animal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can improve insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, endurance, and body weight and protect against neuropathy in prediabetic and diabetic mice fed a high-fat diet (98016). In addition, research in obese rats shows that taking oral nicotinamide riboside 400 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks increases weight loss when compared with control (107704, 110505). However, other research in normal weight and obese mice shows that supplementing nicotinamide riboside in drinking water for 8 weeks does not affect body weight, glucose tolerance, or energy expenditure when compared with control (107705). In contrast, other animal research in obese mice shows that taking nicotinamide 400 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks improves glucose tolerance and lowers body weight (110505). Furthermore, other animal research shows that administration of higher doses of nicotinamide riboside actually induces glucose intolerance and causes white adipose tissue dysfunction in mice fed a mildly obesogenic diet (102042). The reasons for these contrasting results are not known; however, some researchers have suggested that the types of animal studied, animal sex, and duration of treatment may contribute to differing results (107705, 110505).\n\nIn humans, preliminary clinical research in a small number of nondiabetic males with obesity shows that taking nicotinamide riboside (Niagen, ChromaDex) 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not seem to improve glycemic control, beta-cell function, mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, or levels of insulin, incretin hormones, or bile acids when compared with placebo (102037, 102038).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using nicotinamide riboside to treat or prevent sarcopenia. In vitro research shows that human muscle cells treated with nicotinamide riboside demonstrate improved aerobic cellular respiration. Similarly, animal research in middle-aged mice shows that treatment with nicotinamide riboside 300-600 mg/kg orally daily for 4 weeks improves muscular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) concentration and treadmill performance when compared with control. However, treatment with nicotinamide riboside 600 mg/kg daily actually reduced body weight when compared with control (107707). In addition, preliminary clinical research in generally healthy, older adults shows that taking a combination product containing nicotinamide riboside 1000 mg and pterostilbene 200 mg orally daily for 2 weeks does not improve markers of muscle injury and recovery after muscle stimulation, such as muscle stem cells, creatine kinase, and myoglobin when compared with placebo (110507).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nThere is interest in using nicotinamide riboside to treat ataxia telangiectasia. Researchers believe that nicotinamide riboside supplementation may support cellular processes that are inhibited in patients with ataxia telangiectasia, such as oxidative stress, DNA repair, and energy metabolism. Preliminary clinical research in patients with ataxia telangiectasia shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 25 mg/kg orally daily for 4 months increases plasma nucleoside concentrations (107703).\n\nThere is also interest in using nicotinamide riboside to treat Parkinson disease. Preliminary clinical research in adults with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease shows that taking nicotinamide riboside 500 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks increases cerebral and cerebral spinal fluid nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels when compared with placebo (110504).\nNeuroprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can slow cognitive decline in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer disease (98018, 102040). Researchers suggest that elevated NAD+ concentrations from nicotinamide riboside supplementation increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC) 1-alpha expression in the brain. This helps regulate the generation of beta-amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer disease (98018). Additional animal research in diabetic mice and obese rats shows that nicotinamide riboside inhibits neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis when compared with control (102034, 107704). Research in diabetic mice also shows that nicotinamide riboside improves cognitive function (102043). Other animal research shows that nicotinamide riboside can protect against noise-induced hearing loss in mice. Researchers suggest that nicotinamide riboside supplementation activates the NAD+-SIRT3 pathway, which reduces the degeneration of neurites caused by exposure to intense noise (98019). Clinical research in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking nicotinamide riboside daily for 8 weeks decreases plasma levels of phosphorylated tau 217, although it did not improve clinical measures of cognitive function (116104).\nOphthalmic effects\nAnimal research suggests that peritoneal injections of nicotinamide riboside seem to improve retinal function, disrupt photoreceptor cell layers, and reduce outer retina inflammation and light-induced retinal degeneration (104938).\nPulmonary effects\nNicotinamide riboside is of interest for chronic lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical research in adults with stable COPD and a prior history of smoking shows that taking nicotinamide riboside daily for 6 weeks reduces sputum levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 (IL-8) when compared with placebo (116105)."

It is found in a variety of plants, including bitter orange, the dried rind of tangerine, Acacia rigidula, barley, some cacti, and ginkgo (94386, 100080, 100082, 100083, 100085, 100086, 100087, 100088, 100105). It is also found in small amounts in human plasma and is known as a trace amine (100084).\n\nIn 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised consumers to avoid supplements containing N-methyltyramine. It has been added to the FDA's Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List, noting that it appears to be unlawful to include N-methyltyramine in dietary supplement products. However, it is sometimes found as an ingredient in dietary supplements. N-methyltyramine is also included on the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) list of agents that are banned for use by athletes in competition. It is generally considered to be banned for use by athletes by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) due to its status as a phenethylamine derivative (94386, 100084, 100104, 101019).",

It is found in low levels in human plasma and is known as a trace amine (100080, 100084, 100105).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn laboratory research, N-methyltyramine inhibits small intestinal propulsion and induces the relaxation of the smooth muscle. The mechanism seems to be related to its transformation to epinephrine (100080).\nWeight loss effects\nN-methyltyramine has been used for weight loss due to the assumption that it would have similar effects to other phenethylamine compounds. However, in animal research, N-methyltyramine has a weak antagonistic effect on the alpha-2-adrenoreceptor (100080, 100083) and in vitro, N-methyltyramine is not lipolytic and seems to modestly inhibit lipolysis (100081, 100084). Also, in animals, N-methyltyramine stimulates the secretion of the gastric hormone gastrin and of pancreatic enzymes, suggesting an acceleration of digestion (100087). So far, the data do not support the proposed weight loss effects of N-methyltyramine and instead suggest a potential increase in nutrient utilization and appetite (100105)."

            "Overview": "Noni is a small evergreen tree with large leaves and ovoid yellow fruit that is found in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, Australia, and India. The mature fruit is considered to be foul in taste and smell. Many parts of the plant, including the roots, stem, bark, leaves, flowers, and fruit, are used medicinally (11944). It has been traditionally used as an antipyretic and for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.",

Noni juice has been used in doses of up to 200 mL daily with apparent safely in small clinical studies for up to 3 months (11944, 17169, 65173). However, there have been several case reports of increased liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity in people taking some noni products (13107, 14341, 14468, 17170, 17171, 17172). In three reports, hepatotoxicity was linked to a specific brand of noni juice (Tahitian Noni Juice, Tahitian Noni International) (14341, 17171). It is unclear if potential contaminants or hypersensitivity reactions may be the cause of these events. More evidence is needed to determine if noni increases the risk for hepatotoxicity.\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of noni fruit extract when used orally or the safety of noni when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: While animal research is conflicting on the teratogenic effects of noni (65205, 65206), there is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of noni in humans; avoid using.",

However, studies have not conclusively identified whether noni, or contaminants in noni products, were responsible for this toxicity.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, dehydrated noni fruit has been reported to cause nausea and abdominal discomfort (65173).\nless\nHepatic\nNoni has been associated with several cases of hepatotoxicity in previously healthy patients ranging in age from 14 to 62 years (13107, 14341, 14468, 17170, 17171, 17172). In two cases, the patients had used a tea or other herbal products containing noni (13107, 17172); five had consumed noni juice, specifically Tahitian Noni Juice (Tahitian Noni International) (14341, 16648, 17171); and two cases involved energy drinks containing several herbal ingredients including noni (17170, 90125). Symptoms of liver dysfunction and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) were seen between 2 weeks and 4 months after starting noni. The LFTs started to improve within 2 days of stopping noni and generally normalized within 1 month (13107, 14468, 17171). Biopsy findings included acute hepatitis, inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis, and hepatocellular cholestasis (14341, 17170). One patient, who had a history of prior mild acetaminophen toxicity, had rapidly progressive liver failure after noni ingestion and required transplantation (14341).\n\nPotential product contamination was not ruled out in these case reports. Some researchers theorize that anthraquinones contained in noni could potentially cause hepatotoxicity. Other products containing anthraquinones, such as senna, have been linked to cases of hepatotoxicity. However, analyses of a noni juice product associated with reports of liver damage (Tahitian Noni Juice, Tahitian Noni International) have not detected anthraquinone content (14444). Another analysis of noni fruit puree from which the seeds and skin had been removed had no detectable anthraquinones (92201). However, products containing seed or leaf material had detectable amounts of anthraquinones (92201). The part of the noni plant used might affect hepatotoxicity risk.

In human research, the constituent scopoletin was detected in the urine after use of noni supplements (65173).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of noni are the fruits, leaves, flowers, stems, bark, and roots. Noni contains potassium, vitamin C, anthraquinones, beta-sitosterol, carotene, vitamin A, flavone glycosides, linoleic acid, caproic acid (which may explain its foul odor), ursolic acid, rutin, and other constituents (11944, 14445). Some authors have identified anthraquinones in noni fruit samples (14445, 65150). However, others suggest that the anthraquinones, lucidin, alizarin, and rubiadin, are not present in ripe noni fruit samples unless the sample contains fruit skin or leaf fragments (92201).\n\nNoni fruit juice contains a significant amount of potassium, approximately 56 mEq/L (1298). Other substances present in noni fruit include iridoids such as asperuloside, asperulosidic acid, and diacetylasperulosidic acid; flavonol glycosides such as rutin, quercetin, isoquercetin, and kaempferol; phenolic acids such as vanillic, ferulic, and caffeic acids; glucopyranose derivatives; and 4-epi-borreriagenin (17174, 17175, 103182). Noni stems contain morindicone and morinthone (65174). Noni fruit also contains 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin, known as scopoletin. Scopoletin content may depend on growing conditions. In one study it was isolated from noni fruit grown in Japan, but not from fruit grown in Puerto Rico (17175). Pheophorbide A is a constituent found in noni leaves (92206).\n\nTwo constituents of noni, xeronine and proxeronine, are often touted in advertising about noni. However, these compounds have not been chemically identified or described in medical literature and are currently regarded as questionable (11964).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that noni might have analgesic activity (11944). In animal models, lyophilized aqueous extracts of noni root have central analgesic effects, blocked by naloxone (444). Also, in animal models, noni fruit puree and alcoholic fruit extract both have analgesic effects, comparable to known analgesic medication (65160, 65243). There is also some preliminary evidence that dehydrated noni fruit reduces pain in patients with cancer (65173, 65244).\nAnthelmintic effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that constituents in the fruit and roots of noni might have anthelmintic effects (11944, 65174). In laboratory research, a noni leaf extract had anti-parasitic effects against a nematode worm (2767). In human research, topical application of an ointment containing 1% noni stem extract demonstrated treatment response in most individuals infected with leishmanial (65174).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that noni might have anti-inflammatory activity (14340, 65152, 65185). Laboratory research suggests that the anti-inflammatory activity of noni may be related to the inhibition of the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, the production of inflammatory mediators, and the stmulation of cells involved in inflammation (65153, 65154, 65160, 65168, 92203). In individuals with knee osteoarthritis, noni juice reduces levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a biomarker of inflammation (65206).\nAntiallergy effects\nLaboratory research suggests that noni might have anti-allergy effects. Skin allergic reactions appear to be reduced with both leaf and fruit extracts. The mechanism of action might not be the same between the two extracts. For example, the leaf extract, but not the fruit extract, appears to inhibit the activity of some immune cells involved in the allergic response, even if both reduce swelling (92205).\nAntibacterial effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that constituents in the fruit and roots of noni, as well as noni juice, have antibacterial effects (11944, 35010, 65137, 65166, 65207, 65208, 92203).\nAntidepressant effects\nAnimal research suggests noni root extract might have antidepressant activity (11966).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn healthy adults, taking noni juice in 3 doses of 30 mL at 1 hour intervals was associated with a mean decrease in blood glucose of 7.3% (103182).\nAntifungal effects\nLaboratory research suggests that noni fruit extract has antifungal effects against Candida albicans (92200).\nAntihypertensive effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that various parts of the noni plant might have hypotensive activity (11944). In human research, noni fruit juice has been shown to lower blood pressure, possibly by a mechanism related to the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) (65193). In one study in healthy adults, taking noni juice in 3 doses of 30 mL at 1 hour intervals was associated with mean decreases in systolic blood pressure of 6 mmHg (5%), and in diastolic pressure of 5 mmHg (6.5%) (103182).\nAntilipemic effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that noni juice might reduce cholesterol levels. In animal models, noni juice lowers total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, possibly by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway (65213, 65242).\nAntineoplastic effects\nNoni fruit juice contains a polysaccharide-rich substance which increases survival in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma; noni fruit juice possibly activates the host immune system (441, 65142, 65179, 65181, 92204). Damnacanthal, an anthraquinone isolated from the roots of noni, may affect second messenger signaling and reverse or prevent mutagenicity of cancer cells (442, 443). It also seems to promote capillary degeneration and death in experimental tumor tissue (11965). Noni fruit and other extracts or constituents also appear to affect second messenger signaling resulting in a reversal or prevention of mutagenicity of cancer cells (65127, 65129, 65134, 92204).\n\nOther preliminary research suggests that noni may inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce cell death (11964, 92204, 92208) and inhibit the formation of DNA adducts (65162). An anthraquinone isolated from noni fruit is a potent inducer of quinine reductase, a phase II enzyme involved in carcinogen metabolism and elimination (14445). Laboratory research also suggests that noni fruit and leaf extract appear to have antiangiogenic activity (65171).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of noni may play a role in its potential clinical effects, including benefits for heart disease, cancer, and inflammation. Laboratory research suggests noni extracts, constituents, and fractions have antioxidant effects; and in humans noni juice may have some small antioxidant effects (65126, 65131, 65144, 65148, 65161, 65196, 65223).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research suggests that constituents in the fruit and roots of noni might have antiviral effects (11944, 92206). In laboratory research, noni leaf extracts have antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus; the constituents pheophorbide A and pyropheophorbide A, breakdown products of chlorophyll, appear to play a role by preventing viral entry and replication. Extracts of fruit, roots, and stems are less effective (92206).\nCardiac effects\nIn healthy adults, taking noni juice in 3 doses of 30 mL at 1 hour intervals was associated with a mean decrease in heart rate of 7.5% (103182).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn preliminary animal studies, scopoletin, a constituent of noni, reduced esophagitis and esophageal perforation associated with acid reflux, and also reduced development of gastric lesions in response to intragastric ethanol or acetic acid, or subcutaneous injections of serotonin (17173). An aqueous extract of the noni fruit has gastric prokinetic activity in animals (17173). Laboratory research also suggests that noni fruit extract inhibits the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric cancer cells and prevents the stimulation of inflammation of these cells (92203).\nImmune system effects\nPreliminary research suggests that noni might have immunological activity, resulting in increased thymus size (11944).\nSedative effects\nIn animal models, lyophilized aqueous extracts of noni root have sedative effects (444)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nIn vitro research suggests that the nutmeg constituent myristicin is metabolized to 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes (26027). Myristicin can also be metabolized to 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA) (103373).\nExcretion\nIn animals, two metabolites of myristicin, 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene and 1'-hydroxymyristicin, are excreted in the urine (26028). Tertiary amino methoxy methylenedioxy propiophenones have also been identified in the urine of rats and guinea pigs following oral or intraperitoneal administration of myristicin (26029).\n\nIn patients suspected of nutmeg abuse, O-demethyl elemicin, O-demethyl dihydroxy elemicin, demethylenyl myristicin, dihydroxy myristicin, and demethylenyl safrole have been identified in the urine (25950).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNutmeg is the seed of the Myristica fragrans tree. Myristicin makes up about 2% of nutmeg powder (26011). However, the volatile oils of nutmeg contain 1.1% to 45.6% myristicin depending on region from where nutmeg was harvested (26062). Other constituents of nutmeg volatile oil include elemicin, eugenol, isoeugenol, cineole, borneol, and safrole (2563). The processing conditions do not seem to affect the relative content of volatile oils or fatty lipids in nutmeg (26063). Other constituents include licarin-B and macelignan (25977, 78140).\nAnalgesic effects\nTraditionally, nutmeg is used topically as an analgesic. There is evidence from animal research that nutmeg has analgesic effects, possibly by decreasing the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (25547, 25987, 103372).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nNutmeg is used for mucosal inflammation. Animal and in vitro research has shown anti-inflammatory effects related to nutmeg extract (25986, 25987, 109585).\nAnticancer effects\nNutmeg is of interest for cancer. Some in vitro evidence suggests that both nutmeg extract and the constituent myristicin can induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines (25973, 25989).\nAntidepressant effects\nNutmeg has traditionally been used for anxiety. Some evidence from animal research suggests that nutmeg extracts exhibit antidepressant-like activity. This is possibly related to the activation of either the 1-adrenoceptors or dopamine (D2) receptors (25995).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nNutmeg is traditionally used for diarrhea. Evidence from animal research suggests that nutmeg extract can decrease the number of loose stools (25547). In addition, evidence from in vitro research suggests that nutmeg extract can inhibit the propagation of human rotavirus (HCR3) by 90% (26035).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe antimicrobial effects of nutmeg are of interest, especially for dental uses. Nutmeg extract and its constituents have been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal effects in vitro (25998, 26000, 36131, 39783, 78140, 103372).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that nutmeg has hepatoprotective effects. In a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nutmeg extract attenuated increases in markers of liver injury, markers of inflammation, and lipid levels in the liver. These effects are thought to be due to inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) pathway and downregulation of the fatty acid synthase pathway (109585).\nNeurological/CNS effects\nNutmeg is traditionally used as medicine for anxiety and psychosis. It is also used as a hallucinogen. In animal models, nutmeg has been shown to improve learning and memory (26047). Individual constituents of the volatile oil, including borneol, eugenol, safrole, and myristicin, have a variety of individual CNS stimulating or depressing effects (2563, 25547, 25548, 25939, 26048, 26056). Potential neurologic effects of nutmeg have been attributed to metabolites formed from the nutmeg constituents elemicin, myristicin, and safrole (25950).\nSexual effects\nNutmeg is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac. Evidence from animal research suggests that oral intake of 50% ethanol extract of nutmeg increases libido and potency in male rats (26053, 26054)."

            "Overview": "Nux vomica is a plant that grows extensively in Southern Asia. The dried seeds have been used alone or in combination with licorice in Ayurvedic and traditional Asian medicines (65336, 115642). Nux vomica contains strychnine, which can cause severe adverse effects that can sometimes be fatal (13, 18, 65345).",
            "Warnings": "Oral nux vomica can cause severe adverse effects, including death (13, 18, 65345).",
            "Safety": "UNSAFE when used orally (2, 13, 18, 505). Nux vomica in doses of 30-50 mg contains approximately 5 mg of strychnine, and can cause severe adverse effects. 1-2 grams of nux vomica contains 60-90 mg of strychnine, and can be fatal (13, 18, 65345). Chronic ingestion of lesser amounts can cause death after a period of weeks (18).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: UNSAFE when used orally (2, 13, 18, 505); avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOral nux vomica is toxic and can cause severe adverse effects, including death.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Agitation, anxiety, muscle hypertonicity, muscle spasms, pain, stiffness, and twitching.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Death, dyspnea, hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, respiratory acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and seizures.\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, 30-50 mg nux vomica (5 mg strychnine) can cause restlessness, feelings of anxiety, heightening of sense perception, enhanced reflexes, equilibrium disorders, painful neck and back stiffness, followed later by twitching, tonic spasms of jaw and neck muscles, painful convulsions of the entire body triggered by visual or tactile stimulation with possible opisthotonos, muscle hypertonicity and agitation. Dyspnea may follow spasm of the respiratory muscles (18). Seizures occur within 15 minutes of ingestion (or 5 minutes of inhalation) and may result in hyperthermia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuric renal failure (17). In one case report, a 58-year old woman developed dizziness with abdominal and leg pain following a seizure, after ingestion of one nux vomica fruit. Her muscles were tense and hyper-reflexive and she had lactic acidosis and nystagmus (65345). Most deaths occur 3-6 hours post-ingestion from respiratory and subsequent cardiac arrest, anoxic brain damage, or multiple organ failure secondary to hyperthermia (18, 505). Strychnine accumulates with extended administration, particularly in individuals with liver damage (2).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn rats, plasma levels of the alkaloids strychnine and brucine increase following oral intake of nux vomica (115642).\nExcretion\nStrychnine is excreted in the urine. Up to approximately 8.6% of strychnine is excreted unchanged within 12 hours (65341).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of nux vomica is the seed. Nux vomica contains alkaloids, mainly strychnine and brucine (13, 65339, 115642). After processing of the seed, the alkaloids are metabolized, usually to nitrogen oxidation derivatives such as brucine N-oxide (65336). Processing results in a reduction of strychnine by about 90% (65339). Nux vomica also contains iridoids (65338).\nAnti-cancer effects\nNux vomica is traditionally used for cancer. The constituent brucine has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human liver cancer cells in vitro, possibly by inducing apoptosis (65340).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nNux vomica is traditionally used for arthritis and musculoskeletal injuries. The constituent brucine and its metabolite brucine N-oxide have anti-inflammatory effects in an animal model. Possible mechanisms of action include inhibition of inflammatory mediators (65336).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nNux vomica contains strychnine and brucine (13). These are centrally-acting neurotoxins. Strychnine competitively antagonizes post-synaptic binding of the inhibitory transmitter glycine, which leads to heightened reflex excitability of muscles. External irritations or centrally-acting stimulants can trigger convulsions (2, 505). Nux vomica can selectively inhibit the spinal cord in subconvulsive amounts (2). Strychnine causes convulsions by leading to a full contraction of all voluntary muscles (13, 18, 505). Some researchers have suggested that lower doses of nux vomica may improve neuropathy via anticoagulant activity, anti-oxidant activity, or by increasing nerve growth factor (NGF). However, initial clinical research shows that nux vomica 0.2-0.4 grams three times daily does not affect serum NGF levels and produces only minor changes in some markers of coagulation (104775).\n\nNux vomica is of interest for myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease that affects the neuromuscular junction and resulting in muscle weakness. In a mouse model of myasthenia gravis, nux vomica improves symptoms, possibly by inhibiting transcription pathways involving Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (115643)."
