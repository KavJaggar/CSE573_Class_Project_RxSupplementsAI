            "Overview": "Iboga is a shrub that grows wild in Gabon, Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Guinea, and other countries in Africa (89188, 105386). Its root bark is used in some ceremonial practices for its hallucinogenic and stimulant properties (812, 27122, 105382). Iboga root bark contains the constituent ibogaine which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists as a schedule I substance, meaning this substance has a high potential for abuse (89201).",

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nThere is currently a limited amount of information available about the adverse effects of whole iboga products or extracts. Orally, ibogaine, a constituent of iboga, can cause serious adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Arrhythmia, ataxia, diarrhea, hallucinations, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nCardiovascular\nIbogaine is a constituent of iboga. There are numerous case reports of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and QT interval prolongation, some of which resulted in torsade de pointes, in patients who took ibogaine orally. Some of these patients did not have any prior cardiovascular disease (89183, 89184, 89185, 89186, 89192, 89198, 94529, 94531, 105381, 105383)(105386, 111735). In some cases, cardiac complications resulted in death (89187, 89194, 105382, 105384, 111735). One case series suggests that most deaths associated with ibogaine occur in patients with pre-existing co-morbidities, specifically cardiovascular disease, or those taking benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, or opiates (111735). Noribogaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, is also associated with cardiotoxic effects, including dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval (94529, 94531, 111735).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIbogaine, a constituent of iboga, taken orally may cause nausea and vomiting in some individuals (89199, 92951, 92952, 105383, 105386, 105389, 111735). Doses up to 25 mg/kg have been associated with diarrhea (92952). In one case report, a 61-year-old male developed hypokalemia following heavy vomiting and diarrhea within 6-12 hours of ingesting a single dose of 5.6 grams of ibogaine (105386). However, a meta-analysis of 2 small clinical trials shows no greater risk of nausea between ibogaine/noribogaine and placebo among adults being treated for substance use disorder (111735).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIbogaine is a constituent of iboga. When taken orally in doses ranging from 12-29 mg/kg, ibogaine may cause ataxia, tremors, and muscular pain (89199, 92951, 92952, 111735). Noribogaine, the metabolite of ibogaine, is thought to be less likely to cause tremors (94529).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIbogaine, a constituent of iboga, taken orally in doses ranging from 10-32 mg/kg may cause confusion, dizziness, dream-like states, hallucinations, and headaches (89199, 105389, 111735). Ibogaine in doses up to 25 mg/kg has been associated with cases of extreme sensitivity to color and sound, sweating, cold sensations, increased energy and appetite, insomnia, and a strong aphrodisiac effect (92952, 111735). Severe transient ataxia was reported in all patients in an observational study with full remission within 24 hours (105383).\n\nIn one case report, 3.8 grams of ibogaine taken over a few hours resulted in dissociation and motor agitation in a 33-year-old heroin addict (89183). There have also been three case reports of mania in patients taking unspecified doses of ibogaine, often in combination with various other medications (89182). A 43-year old female who was using ibogaine for heroin and benzodiazepine addiction was admitted to the emergency room unconscious with idiopathic encephalopathy; it was unclear if the encephalopathy was due to ibogaine or concurrent hypoxia (89192). In another case report, a 61-year-old male developed an alteration in consciousness level within 12 hours of ingesting a single dose of 5.6 grams of ibogaine (105386). In another case report, a 34-year-old female developed hallucinations, seizure activity, and CNS depression shortly after taking ibogaine 2 grams. Confusion persisted after four days in hospital requiring transport to a psychiatric unit (105381).\nless",

It is unclear if oral iboga is beneficial for improving abstinence in patients with alcohol use disorder.\nAn observational study in patients with a history of substance use disorder, primarily with cocaine but also other substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, suggest that taking a single dose of ibogaine is associated with 5.5 months of self-reported abstinence and taking multiple doses of ibogaine is associated with 8.4 months of abstinence. These patients were required to be abstinent for 30-60 days prior to receiving ibogaine, which likely helped to improve the total duration of abstinence (89199).\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral iboga is beneficial for improving abstinence in patients with cocaine dependence.\nAn observational study in patients with a history of substance use disorder, primarily with cocaine but also other substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, suggests that taking a single dose of ibogaine is associated with 5.5 months of self-reported abstinence and taking multiple doses of ibogaine is associated with 8.4 months of abstinence. These patients were required to be abstinent for 30-60 days prior to receiving ibogaine, which likely helped to improve the total duration of abstinence (89199). Additionally, a small clinical trial in adult males with cocaine use disorder shows that taking dried iboga extract 1800 mg decreases cocaine use and cravings acutely and over six months of follow-up when compared with placebo (111735).\nless\nDepression.

Although there is interest in using oral iboga for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of iboga for this condition.\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral iboga is beneficial for opioid withdrawal. Some low-quality clinical research suggests that ibogaine, a constituent of iboga, may reduce withdrawal symptoms and risk of relapse in patients with opioid dependence.\nMultiple case reports, case series, and observational studies suggest that taking ibogaine as a single 10-25 mg/kg dose, with or without an 18-20 mg/kg dose within 2 hours, or as 25-55 mg/kg over multiple doses within a 24-96 hour period, can alleviate acute opioid withdrawal symptoms for 24-72 hours in up to 79% of patients addicted to opioids, including heroin, prescription opioids, and codeine, often in combination with other substances (92951, 92952, 105383, 105387, 105388, 111735). An observational study in individuals receiving ibogaine as part of a 1-week detoxification treatment protocol for heroin or prescription opioid use suggests that withdrawal symptoms are eliminated or drastically reduced in 80% of patients. Craving also seems to improve for at least one week in about 50% of patients, with abstinence rates of approximately 16% and 9% at one and two years, respectively. Also, about 48% of patients decreased use when compared with pre-treatment usage rates. However, consumption increased in 6% of individuals (105389). Additionally, a small observational study in adults with opioid use disorder suggests that taking ibogaine 10-32 mg/kg, administered in a treatment facility, is associated with an attenuation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Also, a small clinical study in males with heroin use disorder shows that taking noribogaine 120 mg might improve opioid withdrawal symptoms when compared with placebo (111735).\nless\nSexual arousal. Although there is interest in using oral iboga to increase sexual arousal, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of iboga for this use.\nMore evidence is needed to rate iboga for these uses.",

One pharmacokinetic study shows that taking the CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine prior to taking ibogaine 20 mg increases the exposure to ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine by 2-fold when compared with ibogaine alone (94530).\nless\nPAROXETINE (PAXIL)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, taking paroxetine with iboga might increase the levels and clinical effects of ibogaine.\nOne pharmacokinetic study shows that taking paroxetine prior to taking ibogaine, a constituent of iboga, 20 mg increases the exposure to ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine by 2-fold when compared with taking ibogaine alone (94530). This is thought to be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 by paroxetine. Additionally, ibogaine has serotonergic effects and may increase the risk for serotonergic adverse effects when taken with paroxetine (813, 94531).\nless\nQT INTERVAL-PROLONGING DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, iboga may have an additive effect with drugs that prolong the QT interval.\nNumerous case reports suggest that ibogaine, a constituent in iboga, can cause QT interval prolongation (89183, 89184, 89185, 89186, 89192, 89198, 94531, 105381, 105383, 105386).\nless\nSEROTONERGIC DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, taking iboga with serotonergic drugs might increase levels of serotonin, resulting in additive effects with serotonergic drugs.\nIbogaine, a constituent in iboga, has serotonergic effects (813, 94531).

            "Overdose": "General\n\nThere is currently a limited amount of information available about the presentation of overdose with iboga. However, overdose with ibogaine, a constituent in iboga, has been reported to cause acute overdose symptoms, including arrhythmia, seizures, respiratory arrest, and death.\n\nThere are numerous case reports of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and QT interval prolongation, some of which resulted in torsade de pointes, in patients who took ibogaine orally. Some of these patients did not have any prior cardiovascular disease. Doses ranged from 600 mg or 10 mg/kg to 7 grams. In some cases, QT prolongation lasted for up to 7-9 days (89183, 89184, 89185, 89186, 89192, 89198, 94529, 94531, 105381, 105383, 105386). Ibogaine has also resulted in ataxia and seizures (89199, 92952, 105381, 105383).\n\nIbogaine has been associated with death, primarily due to cardiovascular complications. In one case report, a 52-year-old male with liver and coronary disease died from cardiac complications after ingesting ibogaine resulting in a serum concentration of 2 mg/L (89194). There is also a report of a 25-year-old male with chronic heroin addiction and a history of supraventricular tachycardia that consumed 2.5 grams of ibogaine over 3 hours and subsequently experienced hallucinations, ataxia, muscle spasms, weakness, fever, and urinary retention. Over two days, these symptoms progressed to breathing difficulty, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death from multi-organ failure (89187).In a third case report, a 40-year-old male died of acute cardiac arrest following use of ibogaine 4 grams in combination with 2 grams of an additional unknown substance for symptoms of heroin withdrawal (105384). In one case report, a female given ibogaine 29 mg/kg experienced respiratory arrest and death (92951). Finally, one death was reported in an observational study related to the use of ibogaine during opioid treatment (105387).\n\nCases of death related to the use of iboga have also been reported. In one case report, a 27-year-old male took a \"teaspoon\" of iboga root in addition to methadone and diazepam and died 12 hours after ingestion. The patient's post-mortem serum concentration of ibogaine was 0.65 mcg/mL. Death was attributed to poisoning from iboga (89188). In another case report of a 27-year-old male, death was thought to be related to the use of a powder purchased online, labelled as iboga, 5-12 hours previously. Conclusions were based on histological analysis as well as findings of ibogaine, noribogaine, and other metabolites in blood and urine samples. Ibogaine concentrations were 3.26 and 28.87 mg/L, in blood and urine, respectively (105382).\nTreatment\nObservational research found that magnesium infusions were required in the treatment of ibogaine-induced QT-interval prolongation with bradycardia (105383). Defibrillation for ventricular flutter was required after ingestion of ibogaine by a 61-year-old male with no history of cardiovascular disease (105386).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIbogaine, a lipophilic molecule, is absorbed after oral, mucosal and intraperitoneal administration (27122).\nDistribution\nIbogaine distributes through the body following a two-compartment model. Ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine are highly lipophilic leading to accumulation in the brain and fat tissue (94531). In addition to distributing to the brain, ibogaine distributes to the lungs, the spleen, and the liver (27122, 94531).\nMetabolism\nIbogaine undergoes first-pass metabolism and is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to noribogaine (27122).\nExcretion\nNoribogaine is cleared from the body more slowly than ibogaine (94531). The elimination half-life of ibogaine is estimated to be 3.3 hours (27122). The half-life of noribogaine is reported to be 28-49 hours in healthy patients. However, in one case report, the half-life of noribogaine was 2540 hours (94529). It is possible that this patient was a slow CYP2D6 metabolizer. Since CYP2D6 is one of the main metabolism pathways of ibogaine, patients that are slow CYP2D6 metabolizers will experience a slower clearance (94531).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of iboga is the root. Iboga is known to cause hallucinations. The hallucinogenic properties of iboga are due to the indole alkaloids, ibogaine, ibogaline, ibogamine, and tabernanthine (271, 105380, 105381).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that iboga has leishmanicidal activity in vitro and also inhibits HIV-1 replication in vitro (15013).\nCentral nervous system effects\nIbogaine, a constituent of iboga, is most commonly used for managing addiction and cravings to opioids and other substances (27122). Ibogaine has kappa agonist effects; it is serotonergic; and it exhibits nicotinic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism (813, 94531, 105388). Animal experiments suggest these effects may have value in treating human addictions to alcohol, nicotine, opioids, cocaine, and other stimulants (812, 813). NMDA antagonism seems to modulate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Kappa agonism seems to increase concentrations of the substance dynorphin in the brain. Dynorphin is thought to increase dysphoric effects of cocaine, which can increase aversion to cocaine (94531). Noribogaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, seems to have overlapping, and possibly stronger, receptor affinities compared with ibogaine. Noribogaine also has high affinity with the mu opioid receptor (105388). Evidence also suggests ibogaine and noribogaine may competitively block dopamine active transporter (111735).\n\nResearchers are also interested in the indole alkaloid coronaridine as a potential anti-addiction treatment. But this constituent causes tremor, neurotoxicity, and bradycardia. A coronaridine analog, 18-methoxycoronaridine, which is produced in the lab, has some similar activity, but does not cause as much neurotoxicity (15013).\n\nIbogaine has also been used recreationally, possibly because it induces dose-dependent CNS stimulation ranging from mild excitation and euphoria to visual and auditory hallucinations (271).\n\nAdditional in vitro research shows that iboga can inhibit acetylcholinesterase and might increase synaptic acetylcholine levels. However the constituent ibogaine does not appear to have this effect (92940).\nDysrhythmic effects\nDysrhythmic effects of ibogaine have been shown in multiple case reports and observational studies (89183, 89184, 89185, 89186, 89192, 89198, 94529, 94531, 105381, 105383)(105386). The mechanism of action may be related to modulation of various myocardial ion channels and muscarinic activity (105381).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal research, both ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine have demonstrated antidepressant-like effects, possibly related to increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in some brain regions (105380). There is also interest in the stimulant properties of ibogaine. In animal research, ibogaine 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg increased time awake and reduced time in slow wave or rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Motor function was also altered, with increased locomotion with 20 mg/kg and decreased locomotion with 40 mg/kg (105385). However, in human research, a single dose of ibogaine 20 mg failed to produce stimulant effects or alter mood ratings (105390)."

Small and low-quality research shows that taking oral idebenone 900 mg orally daily moderately improves or stabilizes visual acuity in patients with early Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). The efficacy of initiating treatment in patients with a long history of LHON is unknown.\nClinical research shows that idebenone 300 mg orally three times daily for 24 weeks improves visual acuity when compared with placebo in patients with LHON with discordant visual acuity, which is most common during early disease (96032). The benefits of idebenone may persist for up to 30 months after treatment discontinuation (95693). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with LHON shows that taking a specific idebenone product (Raxone/Catena, Santhera Pharmaceuticals) starting at 360 mg orally daily and titrating weekly up to 900 mg daily, for a total of 24 weeks improves measures of visual acuity, but not visual field, when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo. The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups, and its validity is also limited by non-randomized treatment allocation (105708).\n\nObservational research in patients diagnosed with LHON within the previous 6 months to 1 year suggests that taking idebenone 900 mg orally daily for an average of 2 years is associated with clinically relevant recovery of vision in 46% to 53% of patients, and stabilization of vision above the limit for legal blindness in 11% to 50% of patients, when compared to baseline. However, the thinning of the retinal ganglion cell layer that occurs in LHON is not reversed (105705, 112058).\n\nAn international consensus statement published in 2017 recommends that patients with early stage (<1 year) LHON begin idebenone treatment as soon as possible, since it seems to have the most benefit when started during early stages of the disease (96029). There is not enough evidence to recommend initiating idebenone in patients with the disease for 1 year or more (96029, 96032). It is recommended that patients be followed-up every 3 months during the first year, and that treatment continue for at least one year after the disease has plateaued (96029). A specific idebenone product (Raxone, Santhera Pharmaceuticals) is approved for the treatment of visual impairment in patients with LHON by the European Medicine Agency under exceptional circumstances (96029). This product is not approved for use in the US.\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. Idebenone is associated with a small improvement in respiratory function in adolescents and teens with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are not taking glucocorticoids.\nClinical research in patients aged 10-18 years with DMD suggests that taking idebenone (Raxone, Santhera Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg three times daily orally for one year attenuates loss of respiratory function., as measured by the decline in peak expiratory flow (PEF). It is reduced by about 3% with idebenone, compared with about 9% with placebo (96028, 112057). Idebenone also attenuates reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), but has little effect on quality of life (112057). One year of treatment with the same dose of idebenone also reduces the risk of respiratory complications (96037). A follow-up study over a mean of 2-4 years shows that taking idebenone continues to attenuate, but does not entirely prevent, the loss of respiratory function. An exploratory analysis also suggests that taking idebenone reduces hospitalization rates and use of systemic antibiotics. The validity of these results is limited by a very small number of events (105706).\n\nTaking idebenone does not seem to improve respiratory function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who are already receiving glucocorticoids (95692).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nFriedreich ataxia. While some preliminary research shows conflicting results (11410, 11413, 11416, 11418, 96039), higher quality clinical research shows that idebenone does not help control cardiac hypertrophy associated with Friedreich ataxia (11415, 96033). Most clinical research also shows that taking idebenone does not treat or slow the progression of ataxia in children and young adults with this condition (11410, 11411, 96030, 96031, 96034, 96038, 96039). Although some preliminary clinical research suggests that idebenone might improve neurological symptoms when taken in higher doses or for longer durations (96031, 96038, 96039), current clinical management guidelines for Friedreich ataxia state that idebenone does not improve cardiac or neurological status in patients with Friedreich ataxia when used over an extended time period (96030).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDepression. Preliminary clinical research in adults aged 55-75 years with post-stroke depression suggests that adding idebenone 30 mg three times daily to paroxetine treatment for 12 weeks increases the effectiveness (cured or improved) rate, as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, from 62% with paroxetine alone to 82% with the combination (112059).\nMitochondrial myopathies. There is preliminary clinical research that suggests idebenone given orally might reduce symptoms in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (11422, 11424, 11426).\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Preliminary clinical research in adults with primary progressive MS shows that taking a specific idebenone product (Santhera Pharmaceuticals) 750 mg three times daily for 2 years does not slow the progression of disability or attenuate central nervous system tissue destruction when compared with placebo (105707).\nWrinkled skin. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of a lotion containing 0.5% or 1% idebenone twice daily for 6 weeks reduces signs of photoaging when compared to baseline. Skin roughness and drying is reduced by up to 26%, and fine lines and wrinkles by up to 29%, while skin hydration is increased by 37%. Skin pigmentation is also improved (96036).\nMore evidence is needed to rate idebenone for these uses.",

Doses of 75 mg/kg reach a maximum plasma concentration of about 9530 ng/mL in 2.7 hours. In children, doses of 5 mg/kg reach a maximum plasma concentration of about 800 ng/mL in 3 hours. Doses of 75 mg/kg reach a maximum plasma concentration of about 5360 ng/mL in 2 hours (15703).\nDistribution\nIdebenone diffuses across cell membranes more readily than coenzyme Q10 and reaches concentrations in the brain similar to the plasma. Idebenone also distributes into tissues, with highest concentrations found in the kidney, gut, and liver (11414, 11417, 15703).\nExcretion\nAfter oral administration, the half-life of idebenone is approximately 9-21 hours across a range of doses in adults and children (11414, 11417, 15703). The half-life in children is 3-4 hours shorter compared to adults (15703).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIdebenone is a synthetic quinone that is similar to, but less lipophilic than, coenzyme Q10 (96036, 96037, 105707).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn older adults, aged 55-75 years, taking idebenone 30 mg three times daily for 12 weeks is associated with decreases in levels of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 (112059).\nAntioxidant effects\nMany of the therapeutic benefits of idebenone are attributed to its antioxidant effects. As an antioxidant, idebenone appears to protect a wide variety of cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative stress by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. This protects the central nervous system from nerve damage and ischemia (11412, 11417, 11419, 11420, 11425, 96032). Antioxidant activity may also contribute to protective effects of idebenone on muscle fibers in muscular dystrophy. By preventing mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, it can reduce muscle inflammation and fibrosis (112057). In older adults, aged 55-75 years, taking idebenone 30 mg three times daily for 12 weeks is associated with increased levels of antioxidant factors including superoxide dismutase and catalase, and an increase in total antioxidant capacity (112059).\nDermatologic effects\nWhen applied topically, idebenone reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines in the epidermis, possibly allowing for increased production of collagen in the dermis and improving quality of the skin (96036). The antioxidant effects of idebenone in the skin might improve quality of the skin similar to melanin (96036).\nNeuroprotective effects\nThere is interest in using idebenone for many neurologic disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Idebenone seems to maintain ATP formation in ischemic sites, possibly by functioning as a carrier within the electron transport chain (11412, 11417, 11419, 11423, 11425, 105707). The lower lipophilicity of idebenone may improve mitochondrial membrane transport and may make it a more effective agent than coenzyme Q10 in treating dysfunctional electron transport, protecting the central nervous system from nerve damage and ischemia (11412, 11417, 11419, 11423, 11425, 105707). Idebenone may also slow cognitive function decline in patients with Alzheimer disease, possibly by stimulating nerve growth factor (11417).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with LHON shows that taking idebenone 900 mg daily for 24 weeks improves some measures of visual evoked potential, but not retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, when compared with baseline. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (105708)."

The leaves are consumed as a tea-like beverage, also known as guayusa (115140, 115141, 115142, 115147). Ilex guayusa is traditionally used as an emetic, stimulant, and diuretic, to increase fertility and sexual drive, and for diabetes and pain.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when Ilex guayusa is used orally in the amounts found in foods. Ilex guayusa has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using Ilex guayusa orally for medicinal purposes. Ilex guayusa contains caffeine. Although the exact caffeine content of Ilex guayusa tea may vary, it is likely lower than that of coffee. However, the caffeine content in extracts of Ilex guayusa may be higher than that of coffee (113625, 115143, 115145, 115148). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, doses of caffeine up to 400 mg daily are not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as Ilex guayusa, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided.

However, Ilex guayusa contains caffeine, which may cause adverse effects when taken in large amounts.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, a single dose of guayasa extract 600 mg or 1200 mg has been reported to increase systolic blood pressure by 4-6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2-5 mmHg on average in small clinical studies (113625, 115148).\n\nAlthough acute administration of caffeine, a constituent of Ilex guayusa, can cause increased blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 13739). Drinking one or more cups daily of caffeinated coffee also doesn't seem to increase the risk of developing hypertension in habitual coffee drinkers (8033, 13739).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome evidence shows that caffeine, a constituent of Ilex guayusa, is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis in females; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in females with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that increased consumption of caffeine results in increased insulin resistance (91023).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, dry mouth was reported by one study participant taking a single dose of guayusa extract (113625).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine, which is found in Ilex guayusa, and the risk of osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk of the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669).

There is some concern that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as headache, tiredness and fatigue, decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and lack of clear-headedness (13738). Other symptoms such as delirium, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety have been described.

            "Overview": "Indian cassia is a medium-sized evergreen tree that grows to a height of about 8 meters (94315). It is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Himalayas, northeast India, Asia, and Australia (94273, 94274, 94296, 94297, 94314, 94315, 103166). The leaves and bark have been used in cooking and medicine, and as a fragrance, for many centuries (94272, 94273).",
            "Safety": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Indian cassia.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nNo adverse effects have been reported. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian cassia dried leaf, 10 grams three times daily for up to 3 months, lowers fasting blood glucose levels to 100 mg/dL or less in about 50% of patients with diabetes (94272). However, the patients in this study also followed a reduced carbohydrate diet. Therefore it is unclear if the improvement was due to Indian cassia, the diet, or the combination.\nMuscle strength. One small clinical trial in young, resistance-trained males shows that taking a combination product (CinDura, Laila Nutraceuticals) containing Indian cassia and mangosteen extracts, 400 mg twice daily for 42 days, increases muscle strength and endurance when compared with placebo. Single bench and leg presses improved by approximately 23.5 and 29.3 kg, respectively, compared with 3.4 and 5.2 kg, respectively, in those taking placebo. Also, the number of leg extension repetitions increased by 6.5 compared to an increase of 2 with placebo (101079). It is unclear if these benefits are due to Indian cassia, mangosteen, or the combination.\nMore evidence is needed to rate Indian cassia for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Indian cassia.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Indian cassia are the leaf and bark (94273, 94314). Indian cassia leaf extract contains terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, tannins, and flavonoids (94275). Phenolic compounds present include alpha-pinene, camphene, myrcene, limonene, and p-cymene (101079). The bark contains procyanidins, such as parameritannin A1 and cinnamtannins B1 and D1 (94279, 94280). Major constituents of the essential oil of Indian cassia leaves include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, ascabin, beta-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, linalool, and eugenol (94274, 94293, 94314). The major constituents of Indian cassia depend on geographical region of growth and chemotype. Chemotypes differ in the main compound found in the essential oil, which can be eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, linalool, or trans sabinene hydrate-beta-ocimene (94273).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that Indian cassia leaf extracts might reduce inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (94273, 94309). In an animal model of colitis, cinnamtannin D1, a polyphenol constituent of Indian cassia, reduces inflammation and colon damage. It decreases levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6 (112761).\nAntidiabetic effects\nHuman research shows that taking dried leaf of Indian cassia reduces fasting blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes (94272). Preliminary evidence suggests that oil from Indian cassia leaf may reduce blood glucose by promoting insulin secretion and peripheral utilization of glucose (94293, 94308). There is also preliminary evidence that Indian cassia bark extract may protect beta cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis, and promote glucose-stimulated insulin release (94276, 94279, 94310). The bark extract also appears to inhibit the enzyme alpha-amylase (94273, 94314).\nAntimicrobial effects\nEssential oils, volatile oils, and extracts of Indian cassia leaf have antimicrobial effects in laboratory research. Various oils and extracts of Indian cassia leaf have antifungal effects against various species of fungi, including ringworm, Aspergillus species, and Candida albicans (94273, 94294). The leaf extract and volatile oils have anti-bacterial effects against Shigella, Salmonella typhi, and others (94273, 94296). The bark extract also appears to have antibacterial effects (94273). The mechanism of action is not clear and it is not known if Indian cassia has antimicrobial benefits in humans.\nAntioxidant effects\nExtracts of Indian cassia leaves and essential oil have antioxidant activity in vitro and in animal models, possibly due to phenolic and flavonoid constituents (101079, 103166). Gastroprotective and hepatoprotective activity of Indian cassia have also been attributed to antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity (94273, 94295).\nDermatologic effects\nPreliminary clinical evidence shows that applying a gel emulsion formulation containing 4% Indian cassia leaf extract to facial skin twice daily for 90 days reduces melanin production, skin erythema, pore size, and sebum production when compared with placebo in healthy females. These effects may help reduce the damaging effects of sun exposure, and could be due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Indian cassia. Flavonoids present may also inhibit tyrosinase which is involved in melanin biosynthesis (103166).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGastroprotective effects of Indian cassia leaf have been shown in animal models. Indian cassia leaf extract decreases stomach acid output and protects against ulcers. It also reduces diarrhea. The gastroprotective activity is attributed to antioxidant and free radical scavenging capabilities of its constituents (94273).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIndian cassia leaf powder in suspension has hepatoprotective effects in animal models of liver toxicity (94273, 94295). The antioxidant effects of the leaf are thought to play a role in the mechanism of action. Other potential mechanisms of action include modification of liver metabolic processes (94295).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn animal hyperlipidemic models, Indian cassia reduces levels of cholesterol. This may be due to its flavonoid content (94277, 94315).\nImmune effects\nIn laboratory research, Indian cassia extract and its polyphenol constituent cinnamtannin D1 have immunosuppressive effects, reducing levels of cytokines and activity of T-lymphocytes (94280, 112761). In animal models, Indian cassia extracts reduce delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, antibody production, white blood cell counts, and the activity of macrophages (94273).\n\nIn an animal model, cinnamtannin D1 corrects the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T-cells (T-reg) seen in colitis. In mesenteric lymph nodes, it reduces levels of T-helper cells and increases levels of T-reg cells by affecting levels of regulatory transcription factor proteins, including decreasing STAT3 and ROR-gamma-t levels, and increasing STAT5 and FOXP3. These effects of cinnamtannin D1 on Th17/T-reg balance are mediated via the AMPK/mTOR pathway which controls cellular survival and metabolism (112761)."

Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for dyslipidemia.\nMeta-analyses of 12 small clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome show that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 0.5-3 grams daily or Indian gooseberry fruit 12 grams daily for 2-12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by around 39 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15-34 mg/dL, and triglycerides by around 22-52 mg/dL when compared with control groups. Results are conflicting whether Indian gooseberry increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (111567, 111568). Subgroup analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry is more effective at doses greater than 1 gram daily and in adults with triglycerides above 150 mg/dL (111568). Clinical research in patients with dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry whole fruit extract (Tri-low, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 34% and 20%, respectively, compared with 15% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo (99238).\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of GERD.\nClinical research in adults who have had non-erosive symptoms of GERD for at least 3 months shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract 1000 mg twice daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of heartburn and regurgitation by about 63% and 50%, respectively, compared with reductions of 24% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo (99240).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, middle-aged females shows that drinking 50 mL of a juice containing Indian gooseberry extract 30-60 mg and lingonberry extract 25-50 mg daily for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, thickness, wrinkles, and hydration when compared with placebo (102856). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, lingonberry, or the combination. Another small clinical study in healthy, middle-aged females shows that applying a topical emulsion containing extracts of Indian gooseberry 3% and gotu kola 3% twice daily for 60 days improves skin hydration, some measures of skin wrinkles, and elasticity of the cheek but not the eye when compared with placebo (111571). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, gotu kola, or the combination.\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. Topical Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn individuals with self-perceived hair loss, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a hair product containing Indian gooseberry modestly improves hair growth rate and density, as well as hair thinning, when compared with baseline. Patients used a leave-in product containing Indian gooseberry (Saberry), coconut water solids (Cococin), gamma-L-glutamyl-selenomethionine (Peptiselect), and other ingredients as 3.5 mL in females and 2 mL in males, once daily for 3 months (105353).\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this purpose.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the prevention of CVD.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in adults who are healthy or have CVD risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 500-1500 mg daily for 2-12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15 mg/dL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by around 5 mg/dL, triglycerides by around 22 mg/dL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein when compared with control groups. However, the meta-analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry does not improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure (111567). The validity of these findings is limited by small sample sizes and considerable heterogeneity among the included studies.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults.\nA small clinical trial in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that receiving Indian gooseberry powder 2 grams twice daily for 10 days does not impact RT-PCR positivity rate at day 10 when compared with placebo. Additionally, there were no clear trends in clinical improvement in patients receiving Indian gooseberry when compared with placebo. All patients in this study also received oral hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (110012).\nless\nDiabetes. Several small or limited-quality clinical studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry may modestly improve glycemic control and blood lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA moderate-sized, open-label study in adults with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract, standardized to 10% beta-glucogallin, 2 grams daily for 90 days reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and postprandial blood glucose when compared to baseline, with superior effects on fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose when compared with metformin 500 mg (111569). A smaller clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes on stable doses of metformin shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c by around 0.5% and improves low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels when compared with placebo. Taking a lower dose, 250 mg twice daily, does not seem to improve HbA1c but has a modest effect on lipid levels (105356). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes using various antidiabetes drugs shows that taking powdered Indian gooseberry fruit 1 gram, 2 grams, or 3 grams daily for 3 weeks modestly reduces fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels and improves lipid levels when compared to baseline (105355). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHangover. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hangover prevention.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking Indian gooseberry leaf extract (Phyllpro) 750 mg daily for 10 days prior to alcohol intoxication modestly reduces some hangover symptoms 10 hours later, including nausea, headache, lack of appetite, and dizziness, when compared with placebo. Blood alcohol levels after 12 hours were also reduced. However, the overall hangover score was not significantly different between groups (99846).\nless\nHepatitis B. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for hepatitis B, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. Small studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry might help to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry might reduce levels of LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking Indian gooseberry 50 grams for 4 weeks decreases LDL cholesterol by 15% when compared to baseline (2077). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Amlamax, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg or 1000 mg daily for 6 months reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by about 13% when compared with baseline (99241). Also, one small study shows that taking an Indian gooseberry fruit juice powder 500 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly decreases LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline (99242). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that Indian gooseberry reduces LDL cholesterol in obese individuals. One small study shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol by 16 mg/dL in this population when compared to baseline (92515). However, the validity of these studies is limited by the lack of comparator groups.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hypertension.\nIn patients with uncontrolled hypertension using standard therapies, clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry dried fruit powder 500 mg three times daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 16% and 12%, respectively, from baseline, which is significantly greater than reductions seen with placebo. The frequency of response to treatment, based on a reduction in SBP or DBP of at least 10 mmHg or 5 mmHg, respectively, was also increased from up to 50% to at least 83% of patients (105352). However, other clinical research in adults with cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500-1500 mg twice daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce SBP or DBP more than placebo (105354, 111567).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, open-label study of adults with IBS shows that taking 7 grams of an Unani medicinal product called Jawarish Shahi, containing Indian gooseberry, terminalia, coriander, cardamom, and willow bark, twice daily for 45 days reduces the severity of IBS, as measured by improvements in abdominal pain and distension, bowel habits, and quality of life, when compared to baseline (111570). The validity of these findings is limited by insufficient blinding and the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific Indian gooseberry extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by nearly 10%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15%, and triglycerides by 10%, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 7% when compared with placebo. Additionally, taking this product as 500 mg twice daily reduces total cholesterol by 14%, LDL cholesterol by 26%, and triglycerides by 19%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 22% when compared with placebo. Both doses also seem to improve markers of endothelial function, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation (102857).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for improving weight loss or metabolic parameters in adults with obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 16 mg/dL when compared to baseline. However, there was no effect on other lipids or on blood pressure, body weight, or body mass index (92515). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced mucositis.\nA retrospective observational study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy suggests that rinsing the mouth with Indian gooseberry 1% and povidone-iodine twice daily is associated with delayed development of mucositis and intolerable mucositis and a decreased incidence of intolerable mucositis when compared with povidone-iodine alone (111566). The validity of these findings is limited by the retrospective study design.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that specific Ayurvedic formulas containing Indian gooseberry may be equivalent to glucosamine sulfate 2 grams daily or celecoxib 200 mg daily for reducing pain. Two capsules containing Indian gooseberry 166.66 mg/capsule, ginger 33.33 mg/capsule, and Tinospora cordifolia 73.33 mg/capsule, with or without Boswellia serrata 100 mg/capsule, taken three times daily for 24 weeks, were used. All four treatments reduced active pain by about 28% to 38%, functional pain by 19% to 29%, and functional difficulty by 18% to 25%, with no significant between-group differences in the observed improvements (89557). It is not clear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if subgingival Indian gooseberry is beneficial for periodontitis.\nClinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that the subgingival application of a sustained-release Indian gooseberry fruit 10% gel following scaling and root planing does not affect plaque or gingivitis development over 2-3 months when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest benefit on periodontal destruction based on probing pocket depth (105358).\nless\nVitiligo. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with vitiligo shows that taking 1 tablet containing Indian gooseberry 100 mg, vitamin E 10 mg, and carotenoids 4.7 mg orally 3 times daily for 6 months, in combination with conventional topical therapy and/or phototherapy, increases re-pigmentation in the head, neck, and trunk and decreases signs of inflammation when compared with conventional treatment alone (92513).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Indian gooseberry for these uses.",

The juice of Indian gooseberry inhibits the formation of the genotoxic compounds N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) in humans and animals (2080).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn rats, the tannins emblicanin A, emblicanin B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin found in Indian gooseberry increased concentrations of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase within the brain (2081).\nCardiovascular effects\nClinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract 250-500 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks reduces levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which is a marker of coronary heart disease (92515, 102857, 105356). Preliminary evidence also shows that Indian gooseberry fruit, juice, or extract may lower total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and have positive effects on atherosclerosis and endothelial function (2077, 8180, 102855, 102857, 105356). Animal studies suggest that Indian gooseberry may prevent age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappaB activation (31046).\nCoagulation effects\nClinical research shows that Indian gooseberry extract can inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (92514, 92515). Indian gooseberry extract also inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production in animals (2079).\nConstituents\nThe applicable part of Indian gooseberry is primarily the fruit (2075), but extracts from the leaves and bark have also been used (2078, 2079, 99242).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Indian snakeroot is the dried root (18). The whole root contains over 50 alkaloids (13). The active constituents of the whole root include the rauwolfia alkaloids. The highest concentration of alkaloids is found in the bark of the root. These constituents are found in lower levels in other parts of the plant (13, 94328). The yield of total alkaloids ranges from 0.7% to 3.3% of dry weight (94328). Indole and indole alkaloids found in Indian snakeroot include ajmaline, ajmalicine, aricine, canescine, coryanthine, isoajmaline, isorauhimbine, isoserine, isoserpiline, lankanescine, neoajmaline, papaverine, raubasine, raucaffricine, rauhimbine, raupine, rauwolfinine, recanescine, rescinnamine, reserpiline, reserpine, reserpinine, sarpagine, serpentine, serpentinine, thebaine, yohimbine, and yohimbinine (18, 94328). Although most scientific research has focused on the constituent reserpine, many of the other alkaloids have been shown to have biochemical effects in laboratory research (94328). The alkaloids serpentine, ajmaline, reserpine, and yohimbine are the alkaloids found in the highest levels in Indian snakeroot. Yohimbine levels are lower than the other three (94354, 94356). Indian snakeroot also contains stigmasterol (94350).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal diabetic models, Indian snakeroot reduced glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels (94344, 94353, 107947). The mechanism of action is not clear. However, Indian snakeroot is thought to inhibit the absorption of carbohydrates in the intestine or decrease insulin resistance (94353). Also, two constituents in Indian snakeroot, indobine and indobinine, might prevent downstream complications of diabetes by preventing toxic effects of high levels of glucose (94352).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nIndian snakeroot is traditionally used to reduce diarrhea. In an animal model, Indian snakeroot reduced diarrhea, possibly by increasing absorption of fluids from the intestinal tract (94351).\nCardiovascular effects\nIndian snakeroot reduces heart rate (13, 94331, 94440) and has anti-arrhythmic effects due to the alkaloid ajmaline which produces membrane stabilization (18).\nCentral nervous system effects\nIndian snakeroot demonstrates sedative and tranquilizing effects (15, 94331, 94332, 94438, 94440). Constituent alkaloids in Indian snakeroot also case a general sense of euphoria (13). The sedative effects of Indian snakeroot can result from the depletion of amine stores in the central nervous system (CNS) (13). The constituent reserpine appears to prevent the movement of intracellular neurotransmitters (94328).\nHypotensive effects\nIndian snakeroot demonstrates hypotensive effects (94331, 94332, 94328). Hypotensive effects are believed to be due to the depletion of both catecholamine and serotonin stores and to the prevention of reuptake into nerve endings (13, 18). The greater the proportion of alkaloids present, the greater the hypotensive activity (13).\nNeurologic effects\nReserpine and other alkaloids present in Indian snakeroot have sympatholytic activity, reducing stores of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. They release norepinephrine and other monoamines from storage in neurons and prevent reuptake into the nerve endings (18)."

The ethylacetate and n-butanol extracts of indigo pulchra leaves have also been shown to reduce fasting blood glucose in rat models with diabetes (94890). Indigo pulchra leaf ethylacetate and n-butanol extracts demonstrate antioxidant effects in rat models with diabetes. Theoretically, the antioxidant effects can help reduce some complications of hyperglycemia (94891).\nGastrointestinal effects\nTraditionally, indigo pulchra was used to protect the gastrointestinal system and for diarrhea. Animal research shows that a methanol extract of indigo pulchra leaves reduces castor-oil induced diarrhea comparably to loperamide. Theoretically, indigo pulchra extract decreases diarrhea by reducing endogenous prostaglandin, thereby reducing permeability of the intestinal mucosa (94885, 94886). Additionally, animal research shows that hydromethanolic extract of indigo pulchra reduces ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage and ulceration. Theoretically, this protective effect occurs because indigo pulchra extract reduces the volume and acidity of gastric juice (94888)."

Over 90% of the injected dose is excreted in the urine within 2 days. Less than 2% is excreted in the feces (102824). Indium inhaled during occupational exposure accumulates in the lungs with an estimated elimination half-life of 8 years (111188).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIndium is a rare, soft silvery-white metal. It is used in some manufacturing processes, but there is no known biological role for indium in the human body, and serum levels are undetectable in healthy individuals. It causes severe pulmonary toxicity when inhaled during prolonged occupational exposure (111188, 111189).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, indium-III salts appear to have cytotoxic activity against melanoma cells (15120).\nEnvironmental effects effects\nIndium has been released into the environment as a result of use of indium-tin oxide in the electronics industry. It has been detected in many crops, including grass, wheat, barley, perennial ryegrass, cabbage, garlic, water spinach, and beets. In highly acidic soil, indium is released from indium-tin oxide, then associates with iron hydroxides causing it to precipitate and undergo only limited translocation from roots to shoots to grain of crops such as rice and wheat (111187).\nInflammatory effects\nOccupational exposure to inhaled indium from indium-tin oxide processing at levels below the exposure limit recommended in several countries (0.1 mg/m3), is associated with relatively low serum indium levels (mean 0.36 mcg/mL) and, typically, no symptoms of lung disease. However, there is evidence of increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory markers, including granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and TNF-beta. Levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-16 and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1 are reduced. This suggests that inflammatory changes with the potential to cause lung disease occur even at low serum indium levels (111189)."

The content of glucobrassicin in vegetables varies depending on the plant strain, soil, rainfall, amount of sunlight, and other factors (93237). When the plant cells are damaged by cutting, crushing or cooking, glucobrassicin hydrolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme myrosinase (thioglucosidase), generating indole-3-carbinol, glucose, and thiocyanate (47621, 93238, 93242).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal studies, indole-3-carbinol is reported to be absorbed rapidly (47645). Diindolylmethane (DIM), the main active metabolite of indole-3-carbinol, is formed in stomach acid and absorbed from the small intestine (93238).\nDistribution\nStudies using radiolabeled indole-3-carbinol in animals suggest that it is rapidly distributed to the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain, although this is thought to be mainly in the form of metabolites (47645).\nMetabolism\nIndole-3-carbinol is very unstable in stomach acid, being primarily metabolized to a DIM. Other active metabolites produced in the gut include indolo[3,2b]-carbazole (ICZ, a closed-ring dimer), 2,3-bis-[3-indolyl-methyl]indole (a linear trimer), 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexahydrocyclonal [1,2-b: 4,5-b':7,8-b:]triindole (a cyclic trimer), and ascorbigen, which is a condensation product of indole-3-carbinol and ascorbic acid (93236, 93237, 93238).\nExcretion\nIn animal studies, indole-3-carbinol is eliminated from the plasma and tissues within 1 hour, but metabolites such as DIM persist for several hours (47645, 93237). The majority of a dose of indole-3-carbinole and its metabolites is excreted in the urine (93238).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIndole-3-carbinol (I3C) is derived from glucobrassicin, an indolyl-methyl glucosinolate found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, bok choy, mustard and collard greens, rutabagas, and turnips (7176, 47621, 93237, 98612). Indole-3-carbinol 350 mg to 500 mg is reported to be equivalent to approximately 300 grams to 500 grams of raw cabbage or Brussels sprouts (7173). When the plant cells are damaged by cutting, crushing or cooking, glucobrassicin comes in contact with the enzyme myrosinase (thioglucosidase) and is hydrolyzed to indole-3-carbinol, glucose and thiocyanate (47621, 93238, 93242). Food preparation methods, such as grinding, increase the availability of indole-3-carbinol from kale and broccoli. Microwaving increases the release of indole-3-carbinol in broccoli but has no effect on its release from kale (98612).\n\nIndole-3-carbinol is very unstable in stomach acid, being primarily metabolized to a biologically-active dimer called 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM). Other active metabolites produced in the gut include indolo[3,2b]-carbazole (ICZ, a closed-ring dimer), 2,3-bis-[3-indolyl-methyl]indole (a linear trimer), 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexahydrocyclonal [1,2-b: 4,5-b':7,8-b:]triindole (a cyclic trimer), and ascorbigen, which is a condensation product of I3C and ascorbic acid (93236, 93237, 93238). Animal studies indicate that parenterally administered indole-3-carbinol does not have the same activity as the orally administered compound because the active metabolites are not formed (7188, 93237, 93238).\nAntiestrogenic effects\nIndole-3-carbinol and its metabolites reduce estrogen receptor signaling and transcriptional activity, and compete with estrogen for binding sites in a dose-dependent manner (47621, 93238). Indole-3-carbinol, diindolylmethane (DIM), and indolo[3,2b]-carbazole (ICZ) also alter metabolism of estradiol by inducing cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and 1A2 enzymes (47645, 93237, 93238). Estradiol is normally broken down in the liver to 2-hydroxyestrone, 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, and 4-hydroxyestrone (7173). 2-hydroxyestrone has practically no peripheral estrogenic activity, and exerts antiestrogenic and antiproliferative effects by competing with estradiol for estrogen receptor binding (7173, 47621, 93240). 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone has strong estrogenic activity, damages DNA and cellular proteins making it potentially carcinogenic, and promotes proliferation in breast cancer cell lines (7173, 93240). 4-hydroxyestrone is normally formed to a lesser extent, but is a potent carcinogen (7173). Induction of CYP-1A1 and 1A2 by indole-3-carbinol and its metabolites increases production of the antiestrogenic and more benign 2-hydroxyestrone, at the expense of 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, and this change seems to correlate with anti-tumor activity (47645, 93237, 93238).\nAntifertility effects\nThere is some evidence that indole-3-carbinol can block ovulation in animals (93246).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is preliminary evidence in women at high risk for breast cancer that taking indole-3-carbinol 400-800 mg orally daily for 4 weeks is associated with a 4-fold increase in the activity of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and a 66% increase in the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone in the urine. These changes might reduce the risk of developing breast cancer (47645, 93242). In another study, taking indole-3-carbinol 400 mg orally daily for 3 months was associated with a sustained increase in the 2-hydroxyestrone to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone ratio in the urine in 17 of 20 women (93243).\n\nIn animals, indole-3-carbinol and its metabolites inhibit tumors of the breasts, liver, cervix, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract which occur spontaneously or are induced by chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitroso compounds, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and aflatoxin (93236, 93237, 93242, 98613). In addition to antiestrogenic effects, which contribute to potential activity against breast cancer, indole-3-carbinol and its metabolites have a number of other actions which could inhibit formation and growth of tumors (93237). These mechanisms include inducing DNA repair proteins and inhibiting proliferative activity in cells with DNA damage, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest via modulation of cyclin-dependent kinases in cancer cells, and increasing apoptosis by inactivating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling to downregulate transcription of anti-apoptotic genes (47621, 47645, 93236, 93238). The diindolylmethane (DIM) metabolite of indole-3-carbinol inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells by competing with dihydrotestosterone for receptor binding and preventing stimulation of DNA synthesis (993238). Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by indole-3-carbinol and DIM leads to transcription of genes for cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and induction of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, and 3A1, and of phase II glutathione-S-transferases, which catalyze metabolism of carcinogens (7176, 7187, 47621, 47645). The efficiency of induction of CYP enzymes by indole-3-carbinol may be reduced by a high fat diet (93235).\n\nIn-vitro research shows that indole-3-carbinol is an inhibitor of a ubiquitin ligase enzyme called WWP1. This enzyme is often overexpressed in prostate, breast, and liver cancers, and inactivates PTEN, a potent tumor suppressor gene. Reactivating the PTEN gene with indole-3-carbinol could increase tumor suppression activity (102359).\nAntiviral effects\nIndole-3-carbinol inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in tissue cultures, possibly by interfering with cyclin-dependent kinases needed for HSV gene transcription (14155, 93238). Indole-3-carbinol also inhibits expression and growth of human papillomavirus (HPV), giving it potential activity against diseases such as cervical cancer and respiratory papillomatosis that are associated with HPV (7172, 7173, 7183). Activity of HPV in human cells is known to be promoted by 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, levels of which are reduced by indole-3-carbinol when it induces formation of the alternative, antiproliferative 2-hydroxyestrone metabolite of estradiol (93238, 93239, 93241).\nNeurological effects\nIn an animal ischemia-reperfusion model, indole-3-carbinol improves cerebral blood flow, protecting against infarct and changes in behavioral and neurological functioning. This activity was thought to be due to the antioxidant effects of indole-3-carbinol (98611).\nPro-carcinogenic effects\nThere is some concern that indole-3-carbinol can increase production of the carcinogenic 4-hydroxestrone metabolite of estradiol via induction of cytochrome P450 1B1(CYP1B1) (93237). However, other sources question whether this occurs (47645). There is also concern that indole-3-carbinol given after carcinogen exposure, during the initiation phase of tumor induction, might act as a tumor promoting agent and increase the risk of developing a tumor (7184, 7185, 7186). Research in rats treated with dimethylhydrazine (DMH), a carcinogen, shows that taking indole-3-carbinol with synbiotics reduces the development of colorectal carcinoma, indicating a protective effect against DMH. However, when indole-3-carbinol and synbiotics were taken in conjunction with heme iron in rats treated with DMH, colorectal tumor volume and invasiveness increased (98613). The reason for this interaction is unclear. It is also unclear if taking indole-3-carbinol together with heme iron in the absence of carcinogen exposure would increase the risk for colorectal cancer. More research is needed to understand the implications of this finding.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) effects\nA contributor to disease activity in SLE is thought to be increased production of the 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone metabolite of estradiol which has stronger estrogenic effects than the alternative metabolite, 2-hydroxyestrone. Indole-3-carbinol alters the balance in favor of the 2-hydroxylated metabolite via induction of cytochrome P450 1A1 (93240)."

However, some preliminary clinical research shows that taking inosine 1-2 grams daily for 36 months as monotherapy might improve MS relapse rate, but not disability scores, when compared with no treatment (95291).

In a clinical trial in adults with Parkinson disease, taking an average dose of inosine 1800 mg daily increased serum uric acid levels by 44% when compared with baseline (106854).\nMetabolism\nWhen taken orally, inosine is primarily converted to uric acid (95287, 95288). Inosine is also converted to hypoxanthine and xanthine (95292).\nExcretion\nWhen taken orally, inosine increases urine levels of uric acid (95288, 95289). Preliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy adults taking a single oral dose of 1500 mg inosine shows that the renal excretion of uric acid is lower in obese subjects when compared with normal weight subjects (106856).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nInosine is a type of purine nucleoside found in RNA (370). It is a precursor to uric acid, an antioxidant. When taken orally, uric acid is degraded rapidly by the gut microbiome, preventing absorption (95288, 95289). Inosine, which is converted in the body to uric acid, is bioavailable after oral administration, and is used as a substitute for oral uric acid supplementation (95289).\nBone effects\nIn observational studies, high uric acid levels have been associated with a decreased risk of developing osteoporosis. However, preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking inosine orally 1000-1500 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve serum levels of bone formation or bone resorption markers when compared with placebo. Taking inosine also did not improve femur or lumbar spine bone mineral density when compared with placebo. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (106857).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in using inosine to increase uric acid levels in people with various neurologic disorders. Low uric acid levels have been associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. In animals, increased serum levels of uric acid have been shown to reduce symptoms and pathological findings of multiple sclerosis. It is theorized that this is mediated by increased antioxidant effects against peroxynitrite radicals, which are found in brain lesions in individuals with multiple sclerosis. (95289). However, the clinical benefits of increased uric acid levels are inconsistent in adults with multiple sclerosis (95288, 95289, 95290, 95291).\n\nThere is also interest in using inosine to increase uric acid levels in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as higher serum urate has been associated with prolonged survival in these patients (112395).\n\nLow serum and cerebral spinal fluid uric acid levels have also been associated with an increased rate of disease progression in Parkinson disease (95287, 106852, 106854). Some researchers believe uric acid may slow disease progression by acting as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger (106852, 106854). Clinical research shows that taking inosine increases serum uric acid levels in adults with Parkinson disease (95287, 95289, 106852, 106854). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking inosine for up to 2 years does not prevent disease progression when compared with placebo (106854). Based on these results, some researchers speculate that levels of both uric acid and hypoxanthine must be increased to delay disease progression (106852).\n\nThere is also interest in using inosine to treat bipolar disorder. Research in rats shows that taking inosine 10-25 mg/kg daily for 14 days attenuates ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion. This suggests that inosine might reduce mania symptoms; however, inosine supplementation did not appear to affect adenosine receptor activity (106853).\n\nThere is also interest in using inosine to treat Alzheimer disease. Research in rats shows that intraperitoneal injections of inosine, 50-100 mg/kg daily for 25 days, attenuated chemically-induced memory deficits when compared with control. Inosine injections also attenuated chemically-induced increases in acetylcholinesterase activity and markers of oxidative damage in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (106855).\n\nLaboratory research shows that inosine might stimulate axon growth from uninjured nerve cells to injured nerve cells of the central nervous system. Further studies in humans are needed to establish whether this finding has significance in restoring function after spinal cord injuries (370).\n\nBecause oxidative stress is a factor in the development of peripheral neuropathy, it is theorized that the anti-oxidant effects of inosine could help protect peripheral nerve damage that occurs with type 2 diabetes (110503)."

    "Inositol": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Inositol is a sugar alcohol found in foods such as cereals, corn, meat, citrus fruits, and legumes (91543, 91545, 95082). Inositol was once considered to be part of the B vitamin complex. However, it is now known that inositol is produced in the human body. Therefore, it is not considered to be an essential B vitamin and is instead referred to as a pseudovitamin (91555, 95082). Inositol can be found in nine different stereoisomer forms, but the isomers myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are the most relevant with regards to supplementation (91555, 95082, 95085).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Inositol has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 18 grams daily for up to 6 weeks or 6 grams daily for 10 weeks (2184, 2185, 2187, 95089). Myo-inositol 4 grams daily has also been used with apparent safety for 6 months (95085).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of inositol when used topically.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) has been taken daily for up to 12 weeks in children aged 5-12 years (95092). ...when used enterally or intravenously and appropriately in premature infants for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome for up to 10 days (2191, 2192, 91546, 91551).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used enterally or intravenously for extended durations in premature infants. A large clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation found that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg, given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 10 weeks, was associated with a small increased risk of death (98946). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, between those who received myo-inositol or control (108819).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Myo-inositol has been used with apparent safety in amounts up to 4000 mg daily during pregnancy (91548, 95082, 104688).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using. Breast milk is rich in endogenous inositol (2138); however, the effects of exogenously administered inositol are not known.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and intravenously, inositol seems to be well tolerated. Topically, no adverse effects have been reported, although a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, gas, and nausea.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, inositol may cause nausea, diarrhea, gas, and gastrointestinal discomfort (10387, 11972, 91547, 91549, 95089, 95090, 95092).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, inositol in combination with omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reports of cold and allergy symptoms in children in clinical research (95092).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, inositol in combination with omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reports of tics and other musculoskeletal side effects in children in clinical research (95092).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, inositol may cause dizziness, tiredness, insomnia, agitation, and headache (10387, 11972, 95089, 95092). In combination with omega-3 fatty acids, inositol has been associated with reports of feelings of thirst in children in clinical research (95092).\nless\nPsychiatric\nIn one case report, a 36-year-old male with adequately controlled bipolar disorder was hospitalized with symptoms of mania after consuming several cans of an energy drink containing inositol, caffeine, taurine, and other ingredients (Red Bull Energy Drink) over a period of 4 days (14302). It is not known if this is related to inositol, caffeine, taurine, a different ingredient, or a combination of the ingredients.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral inositol seems to modestly improve lipid parameters, blood pressure, and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nSome clinical research in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome following a low-calorie diet shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams twice daily for one year reduces total cholesterol by 29 mg/dL, triglycerides by 64 mg/dL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 6 mg/dL, and improves insulin resistance when compared with placebo. It did not reduce body mass index or waist circumference in these patients (91554). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows similar effects on blood pressure, especially among postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome, at durations exceeding 8 weeks, and at doses of at least 4 grams (108820).\n\nInositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients to treat metabolic syndrome. A clinical study in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome and at risk for breast cancer shows that taking a combination of inositol and alpha-lipoic acid daily for 6 months, in combination with a low-calorie diet, reduces insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by at least 20% when compared with a low-calorie diet alone. Also, taking inositol and alpha-lipoic acid seems to increase HDL cholesterol by about 6% and reduce triglycerides by 5% when compared to baseline (91543). Another small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol 40 mg, Ceylon cinnamon 250 mg, glucomannan 1000 mg, and inulin 200 mg orally daily for 4 months modestly improves total cholesterol levels and body weight, but not serum glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein levels, high-density lipoprotein levels, or triglyceride levels when compared with no intervention (114552).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral inositol, often in combination with folic acid, seems to improve some glycemic, lipid, metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive parameters in patients with PCOS. However, research is conflicting.\nOral inositol, most frequently in the forms of myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol, has been evaluated for efficacy in a wide range of outcomes associated with PCOS including reproductive and pregnancy outcomes, metabolic parameters, and anthropomorphic measures. Often, inositol is taken in combination with folic acid or metformin.\n\nInositol has been investigated for its effect on metabolic parameters that are often altered in PCOS. A meta-analysis of 9 studies in patients with PCOS shows that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid marginally decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo (111670). Inositol has also been evaluated for its effect on glucose metabolism in adults with PCOS. Meta-analyses of about 10 studies show that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid reduces fasting plasma glucose by 1-4 mg/dL (98944, 111670). However, evidence is conflicting on the effect of inositol on insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance (98944, 111670). Additionally, most studies show that inositol does not improve measures of glucose metabolism more than metformin. The effect of inositol on lipid profiles has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies and other small clinical studies show that taking inositol as D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid modestly reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides when compared with control (2028, 98944, 91552).\n\nSome studies have also investigated the effect of inositol on hormone levels. Meta-analyses show that inositol modulates androgen levels as shown by reduced total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and increased sex-hormone binding globulin when compared with placebo. (2028, 91552, 98944, 111670). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose, and treatment duration within the included studies.\n\nMyo-inositol has also been compared with metformin in some clinical research, with some evidence of benefit (95085, 95086). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies show that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams daily, with or without folic acid, for 12-24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI, waist-hip circumference, or androgen levels when compared with metformin 1.5-2.5 grams daily (100705, 108823, 111670, 111670). However, inositol seems to have a lower risk of adverse effects than metformin. These analyses are limited due to the small size, methodological issues, and high heterogeneity of the included studies. In combination with metformin, small clinical studies show that taking metformin, myo-inositol 550 mg, and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved lipid parameters and postprandial insulin levels when compared with metformin alone (108822).\n\nMeta-analyses and clinical studies have investigated the effect of inositol on ovulation, reproduction, and pregnancy outcomes. Some research suggests that inositol increases ovulation rate, promotes cycle normalization, and improves ovarian function in patients with PCOS (2028, 91552, 98944, 111670). A small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li.Pharma) daily for three spontaneous cycles induces ovulation in about 62% of individuals with anovulatory PCOS and insulin resistance. Adding clomiphene citrate with myo-inositol induces ovulation in about 72% of the patients who remain anovulatory after treatment with myo-inositol alone (91547). Another clinical study shows that taking a combination of inositol 2 grams, folic acid 200 mcg, and N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg (Ovaric HP, Just Pharma) twice daily for 12 months improves ovulation rates in PCOS patients with oligomenorrhea, regardless of insulin sensitivity at baseline (91553). Despite evidence that inositol improves ovulation rates, it does not appear to impact pregnancy rates (111670).\n\nSome research has also investigated the effects of taking both isomers of inositol concomitantly. Taking myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li.Pharma) twice daily, beginning 12 weeks before ovarian hyperstimulation and continuing throughout pregnancy, improves oocyte quality when compared to treatment with D-chiro-inositol alone. The combination appears to increase fertilization rate in patients aged 35 years or younger, but not those older than 35 years (91544). Other clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves pregnancy rates and live birth rates by an additional 10% and 11%, respectively, when compared with myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg. The higher-dose combination also resulted in a 15% lower rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when compared with those taking the lower dose of D-chiro-inositol (102317). Lastly, other research shows that taking myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol together may improve metabolic parameters faster than taking myo-inositol alone (91550).\n\nResearch has also evaluated the effects of inositol on other pertinent clinical outcomes in PCOS. Several small clinical studies show that taking the combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, alone or in combination with metformin, improves menstrual cycle irregularity when compared with metformin alone, but not as much as a taking a combined hormonal contraceptive (108822, 108824). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the studies. Also, a small clinical study shows that taking metformin with myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved acne, but not hirsutism, at 6 months, when compared with metformin alone (108822). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the study.\n\nMore research is needed to clarify the effect of inositol on anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine outcomes in patients with PCOS.\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral inositol in combination with folic acid seems to prevent preterm labor in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes shows that taking myo-inositol plus folic acid daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the risk of preterm delivery by 64% when compared with folic acid alone. Patients in all but one study included in this analysis took myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg twice daily, while patients in the other study took myo-inositol 1100 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg daily (100706). It's unclear if these results are generalizable to individuals with a low risk for gestational diabetes.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent ARDS in preterm infants and may be associated with worsened outcomes.\nHistorically, small clinical trials in infants with or at risk for ARDS have suggested that myo-inositol, given parenterally and enterally for 5-10 days, might improve survival and reduce the risk of death and serious complications (2191, 2192, 91546). However, a large, high-quality clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation at risk for ARDS shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared to the control group, and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation (98946). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups (108819). The most recent meta-analysis, which incorporates this large clinical study, concludes that inositol supplementation does not reduce the risk of death in infants at risk for ARDS (102319).\nless\nAnxiety. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with anxiety.\nA meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking inositol orally does not improve anxiety severity in patients with anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, when compared with placebo (91549).\nless\nDepression. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with depression.\nGuidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that inositol in doses up to 12 grams daily is not currently recommended as monotherapy or adjunctive use for major depressive disorder due to a lack of evidence for efficacy (110318). Additionally, a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials shows that inositol does not significantly improve symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar depression, major depressive disorder, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (91549). While limited research shows that patients receiving inositol for 4 weeks may improve, patients initially responding to inositol seem to relapse rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment (2026, 2185). Additionally, taking inositol with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) doesn't appear to improve the effectiveness of SSRI therapy or improve depression in SSRI treatment failures (2025, 10851).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nMost preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol orally doesn't improve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (2193, 2194, 2195).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants.\nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials shows that myo-inositol, given parenterally and/or enterally, does not seem to reduce the risk of ROP when compared with placebo in preterm infants (100704). A large, high-quality clinical study included in this meta-analysis shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or ROP in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation. In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared with placebo and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation (98946). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups (108819).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. It is unclear if oral D-chiro-inositol is beneficial in patients with age-related testosterone deficiency.\nA very small clinical study in males aged 65-75 years with low-normal morning testosterone levels and signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency shows that taking D-chiro-inositol 600 mg twice daily for 30 days improves sexual function and physical strength when compared with baseline (108821). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder.\nEvidence is conflicting on whether inositol helps treat bipolar disorder in children. One very small preliminary study in children aged 5-12 years with bipolar disorder not on concomitant mood-stabilizing medications shows that taking inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) daily for 12 weeks reduces manic symptoms when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking a combination of inositol 80 mg/kg and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid capsules (EPA; Nordic Naturals) 1650-3000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces manic and depressive symptoms when compared to baseline (95092). However, another more recent study with the same intervention and protocol shows that the combination of inositol and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid reduces symptoms of depression, but does not improve manic symptoms, when compared with either ingredient taken alone (111676).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing breast cancer surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy shows that taking inositol orally 390 mg twice daily and applying IP-6 gel 4% twice daily to the surgical site, starting 2 weeks before adjuvant chemotherapy and stopping 2 weeks after the last cycle, attenuates reductions in white and red blood cell counts when compared with no intervention. Using inositol and IP-6 also improves breast and arm symptom scores and some quality of life scores; however, these improvements were not consistent over time.\nless\nChild growth. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA sub-analysis of a large randomized controlled trial shows that twice daily maternal use of a drink supplement containing myo-inositol 4 grams, folic acid, vitamins D, B6, and B12, zinc, lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and other nutrients throughout pregnancy increases the likelihood of the infant being in the normal weight range after 2 years of follow up when compared with placebo. Infants of mothers using the drink supplement had a reduced likelihood of rapid weight gain when compared with placebo; other anthropomorphic measurements were similar between groups (115691). It is unclear if any effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or the prevention of gestational diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes and a body mass index of at least 25 kg/m2 shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol and folic acid (Chirofol 500, LJ Pharma) daily for 6 months, along with insulin therapy, decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by approximately 0.5% when compared to taking folic acid alone with insulin therapy. However, there was no difference between groups with respect to insulin resistance or body mass index (95088).\n\nMost research shows that taking inositol during pregnancy prevents gestational diabetes. However, most studies conducted to date are of low quality and it is unclear if the results are generalizable. Meta-analyses of 4-7 clinical studies in pregnant adults, some with overweight and obesity, shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 g daily with folic acid (usually as Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) may reduce the relative risk of gestational diabetes by 57% to 92% and reduce insulin requirements in adults at risk for gestational diabetes. Inositol may also be associated with improved infant outcomes such as increased gestational age at birth and reduced preterm delivery, but does not seem to influence birth weight, NICU admission rate, neonatal hypoglycemia, the incidence of shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, or cesarian delivery when compared with control (100706, 103750, 104688, 111664, 111667, 111671, 111677, 114560). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity within the included studies, concerns about blinding, and overall low-quality evidence. Research evaluating a lower daily dose of myo-inositol 1.1 grams with D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li. Pharma International) during pregnancy shows no effect on incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with folic acid alone in adults with a family history of diabetes (95082, 103750).\n\nSome evidence suggests that initiation of myo-inositol, in combination with vitamins and other ingredients, earlier during pregnancy (e.g., 7 weeks' gestation) may be associated with increased blood glucose levels at 28 weeks' gestation. Some researchers have postulated that the beneficial effects of myo-inositol may be optimized by initiating therapy later in pregnancy. However, this hypothesis has not been well researched (115694).\n\nIn patients eventually diagnosed with gestational diabetes, one small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams reduces the number of patients requiring insulin by at least 50% (104688), although another small clinical study shows that adding D-chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, or both to folic acid does not affect insulin resistance when compared with placebo (98945).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for these conditions.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAnother very small study in males with overweight or obesity, mild ED, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4000 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared with baseline (111674). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for this condition.\nHypothyroidism. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical and observational research in adults with hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and other thyroid disorders shows that taking a combination of inositol 600-1200 mg and selenium 83-166 mg orally daily for 6-12 months modestly improves thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and thyroxine levels when compared with control (114562). Clinical research in females aged 18 to 50 years with or at risk for subclinical hypothyroidism in Slovakia shows that taking myo-inositol 600 mg and selenium 83 mcg daily for 6 months reduces patient-reported hypothyroid symptoms including fatigue, menstrual cycle irregularity, and intolerance to heat or cold (110591). The interpretation of this result is limited by the lack of a control group. In addition, it is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to myo-inositol, selenium, or the combination.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in adults undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\nMany small studies report conflicting effects of oral myo-inositol on fertilization rates, implantation rates, and live birth rates in adults undergoing IVF or ICSI (103752, 108825, 111672). Many of these trials used a specific combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International S.r.l) daily, starting 1-3 months before ICSI and continuing until ovulation (103752, 108825). Meta-analyses of up to 8 small randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing assisted reproduction (e.g., ICSI, IVF) with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams orally daily, with or without folic acid, for 8-12 weeks modestly improves the number of oocytes obtained, but does not affect the miscarriage rate or clinical pregnancy rate, when compared with placebo (115693). The validity of this study is limited by moderate heterogeneity.\n\nThe effects of inositol on fertility have also been studied in patients with specific comorbidities. A case-control study in long-term survivors of lymphoma suggests that taking myo-inositol 400 mg and D-chiro-inositol 45 mg (Ovofert Fast, CRL Pharma) three times daily for 12 months is associated with reductions in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea and a modest increase in antral follicle count of the right ovary when compared with control (111673). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. Inositol has also been evaluated in females with PCOS. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with PCOS undergoing IVF or ICSI shows that inositol does not improve pregnancy rates when compared to no treatment. However, inositol may increase clinical pregnancy rates when compared with metformin (111675).\n\nInositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical study in females planning to conceive shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, zinc, and probiotics does not improve time-to-conception, clinical pregnancy rates, or live birth rates when compared with a standard micronutrient supplement. However, the supplement shortens time-to-conception in adults with overweight to durations equivalent to patients who are not overweight, but lengthens time to conception in adults with obesity when compared with placebo (111665). It is unclear whether these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for improving sleep during pregnancy.\nClinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) before bed for 10 weeks, starting at 14 weeks gestation, improves overall measures of sleep quality by a small amount when compared with folic acid alone. However, this improvement was not maintained until 37-38 weeks' gestation. Also, the study was not limited to patients with poor sleep quality during pregnancy, but to any healthy pregnant individual (104687).\nless\nLithium-induced side effects. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing lithium-induced side effects.\nA small clinical study suggests that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks may improve psoriasis associated with lithium therapy when compared with baseline (11972). However, taking inositol orally does not seem to improve other lithium-induced adverse effects, such as tremor, thirst, and changes in thyroid and adrenal function (2027).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for slowing the rate of bronchial dysplasia.\nPreliminary clinical research in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered at high risk for lung cancer shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not increase the rate of complete or partial response when compared with placebo (95090).\nless\nMastalgia. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for cyclic mastalgia; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small retrospective study in females with cyclic mastalgia suggests that applying a specific product containing inositol, Boswellia serrata, and betaine (Eumastos Gel, Lo.Li. Pharma s.r.l.) 2.5 grams topically once daily from the 10th to the 25th day of the menstrual cycle for three months is associated with reductions in mastalgia pain scores when compared with a control cohort (115695). The validity of this finding is limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of a placebo control.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in adults with NAFLD and obesity shows that taking myo-inositol powder 4 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, but does improve some components of lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and anthropometric measures when compared to baseline (111304) However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of the outcomes.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with overweight or obesity.\nA meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies in adults shows that taking inositol 600-4450 mg daily for 6-48 weeks decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.4 kg/m2. Subgroup analysis suggests that myo-inositol may be beneficial at a dosage less than 1000 mg for less than 12 weeks, especially in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and overweight or obesity, with higher baseline BMI, and above 40 years of age (111666). However, the validity of this finding is limited by significant heterogeneity in the included studies.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with OCD.\nOne preliminary clinical study in adults with OCD shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for 6 weeks improves Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores when compared with placebo (2186). However, taking inositol does not seem to improve the severity or type of OCD symptoms in patients already taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (91556). Both of these studies were small, and treatment was administered for only 6 weeks.\nless\nPanic disorder. Oral inositol seems to improve symptoms of panic disorder.\nA very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily reduces the severity and rate of panic attacks and the severity of agoraphobia over 4 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo (2184). Another very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for one month may be as effective as fluvoxamine 150 mg daily for treatment of panic disorder (10387). However, the one-month duration may not have provided adequate time to see the full effects of fluvoxamine.\nless\nPostpartum complications. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA post-hoc analysis of a clinical study suggests that higher blood levels of myo-inositol early in pregnancy are associated with less postpartum blood loss when compared with lower blood levels of myo-insositol (115692). The effects of inositol supplementation are unclear.\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with PTSD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve distress when compared with placebo in patients with PTSD (91557).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for preventing hypertension during pregnancy.\nIn patients with a body mass index (BMI) between 25-29.9 kg/m2, preliminary clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) twice daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 66% when compared with folic acid alone (104688).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral or topical inositol is beneficial for improving symptoms of psoriasis.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks does not improve symptoms of psoriasis in a small group of patients when compared to baseline. However, taking this dose of inositol has a moderate effect on overall symptoms in patients with psoriasis related to lithium use (11972). Preliminary clinical research also shows that topical use of D-chiro-inositol is unlikely to be beneficial for reducing overall symptoms of psoriasis. Topical application of inositol 0.25% or 1% for 6 weeks improves overall symptoms when compared with baseline. However, the inositol-containing creams were no more effective than the control cream (104686).\n\nInositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small prospective observational study in adults with mild plaque psoriasis suggests that applying amino-inositol and urea 40% cream (Inosit U40, Biogena) 1-2 times daily for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in the severity and extent of psoriasis symptoms and improvements in quality of life measures when compared to baseline (111668). The validity of these effects is limited by a small sample size, a lack of a comparator group, insufficient blinding, and the observational study design.\nless\nTrichotillomania. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing hair pulling.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol in doses ranging from 6-18 grams daily over a period of 10 weeks is no more effective than placebo in reducing subjective or clinician-documented symptoms of hair pulling in patients with trichotillomania (95089).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate inositol for these uses.",

The effect of lithium on brain inositol levels might contribute to its therapeutic effect in bipolar disorder (11972, 15514, 15515, 15516). Animal research suggests that inositol supplementation may reduce the therapeutic effects of lithium (15517), whereas dietary inositol restriction may augment the effects of lithium (15513). It has also been suggested that reduction of tissue inositol levels might contribute to adverse effects of lithium; a small study reported benefit with inositol supplements in lithium-induced psoriasis (11972).\nless\nVALPROATE\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nValproate might modestly reduce inositol levels.\nValproic acid reduces inositol levels in the brain by inhibiting the inositol phosphate synthase enzyme, which is involved in synthesis of inositol (15515, 15516, 15517).

The effect of inositol supplements on the efficacy of valproic acid is unknown.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with inositol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOrally, inositol is transported across the intestinal mucosa and absorbed almost completely (91551). In preterm infants, a single intravenous dose of inositol 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg increased serum concentration of inositol in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in serum concentration of inositol following intravenous administration appears to persist for 24-36 hours (91551).\nMetabolism\nInositol is metabolized by myo-inositol oxidase, which is located at the renal cortex (91551). However, metabolism is complex and appears to change in utero, at birth, and is affected by enteral intake and endogenous controls (95093). Some evidence from clinical research suggests that the half-life of a one-time dose of intravenous inositol is 5.22 hours, with multiple doses is 7.9 hours, and overall is 6.31 hours in preterm infants (91551, 95093). However, other clinical research suggests that the half-life of inositol in preterm infants is 4-5 days. Reasons for the discrepancy may be due to enteral intake of human milk in the latter study, which may have contributed to elevated serum inositol levels despite discontinuation of IV treatment (2192). Additionally, inositol is endogenously synthesized, which could also lead to discrepancies (95093).\nExcretion\nClearance of inositol in preterm infants is estimated to be 0.06 L/Kg/hr (91551, 95093). Because myo-inositol oxidase, the enzyme that metabolizes inositol, is less active in newborns, urinary excretion of inositol is higher in premature and term infants compared to infants that are a few weeks old (91551, 95093).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEndogenous inositol is an essential component of cell membrane phospholipids. It has weak lipotropic activity, and can move fat out of liver and intestine cells (2187). Inositol has a variety of stereoisomers, including myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol. Myo-inositol is the most abundant form in the central nervous system (CNS). Biological function varies among the isomers (2047, 2048). Myo-inositol is a source of second messengers such as diacylglycerol. It is required for growth of human cells (95090).\nAnti-carcinogenic effects\nDysplasia in the central airways and peripheral lung is a risk marker for lung cancer, and there is an interest in using myo-inositol for preventing lung cancer. However, early clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not significantly affect bronchial dysplasia in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered high risk for lung cancer, compared to placebo. There was also no difference in Ki-67 (a marker of proliferation) in the bronchial biopsies with dysplasia between groups post-treatment. However, myo-inositol lead to a significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), with a trend towards decreasing oxidant level. Increased baseline plasma and BAL levels of Clara cell protein-16 (an antiinflammatory protein secreted by bronchiolar cells) were associated with positive outcomes as well as decreased levels of plasma myeloperoxidase (95090).\n\nIn smokers with epithelial bronchial dysplasia, the PI3K pathway is activated. The PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell proliferation and survival. PI3K gene expression in normal epithelium decreased in patients who experienced a complete response to myo-inositol, suggesting that myo-inositiol inhibits PI3K signaling. This was not seen in non-responders nor in the placebo group (95090).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nThere is interest in using inositol for various psychiatric disorders. Decreased brain levels of inositol have been seen in patients suffering from depression, anxiety and compulsive disorders (95089, 95092).\n\nInositol is a constituent of the intracellular phosphatidyl inositol second messenger system, which is linked to several neurotransmitters including alpha 1 noradrenergic, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate and cholinergic receptors (10850, 11972, 95089, 95092). Inositol may play a role in the interactions between G protein-coupled receptors and their ligands particularly in the serotonergic pathway (95089, 95092). Inositol might reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors (2187). Limited clinical evidence suggests exogenous inositol may have benefits similar to selective-serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in conditions such as panic disorder, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nDermatologic effects\nSupplemental inositol seems to help psoriasis that is made worse or triggered by lithium therapy. The mechanism is unknown, but lithium seems to cause a reduction of inositol in both the brain and other tissues. Supplementation with inositol doesn't seem to adversely affect the efficacy of lithium for bipolar disorder (11972).\nFertility effects\nThere is interest in using inositol for infertility. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, or a combination of these two forms, seems to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates (91544, 91550, 91553, 102317). In patients with oligoasthenospermia, clinical research shows that treating sperm with myo-inositol in vitro increases sperm motility. This increased motility results in an 18% increased rate of pregnancy during intrauterine insemination when compared with control (102318).\nGrowth effects\nThere is interest in using inositol for growth. Preliminary clinical research in children with idiopathic short stature shows that taking an inositol and vitamin B solution, 10 mL twice daily, for 12 months modestly increases height when compared to baseline. Improvements were larger in those that also completed stretching exercises (112280).\nInsulin sensitizing effects\nIn laboratory and animal studies, it has been shown that insulin resistance is directly related to a deficiency in D-chiro-inositol and an imbalance with myo-inositol. (95086, 95088). D-chiro-inositol acts as a second messenger of insulin signaling and is an insulin sensitizer. Laboratory research suggests that it possesses insulin-mimetic activity and, in peripheral tissues, leads to disposal of intracellular glucose and glycogen storage (95088). Inositol is also a precursor for phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositides play a role in cell signaling and are also secondary messengers involved in glucose metabolism and insulin like effects. Inositol is also a precursor for inositol phosphoglycans (IPG). There are two groups, the P-type and A-type, which are antagonists of each other. The P-type are involved in the activation of glycolysis, while the A type suppresses steps of glycolysis. Insulin resistance leads to increases in urinary inositol metabolites, mostly the A-type. This alters the ratio of A to P-type, leading to a suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Providing inositol supplements in theory, shifts the ratio of A and P-type back to normal (95082, 95083). Furthermore, inositol may increase levels of adipocytokines, particularly adiponectin, which are negatively correlated with glucose and insulin concentrations. When insulin binds to receptors, it may stimulate the intracellular transport of inositol phosphoglycan. Myo-inositol may activate lipogenesis via stimulation of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (95083).\n\nIt's thought that a defect in the availability or metabolism of inositol or IPGs may play a role in insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (95085). As such, there is interest in using inositol in patients with PCOS. Researchers think that inositol induces ovulation in these patients by improving insulin sensitivity. It also produces the second messenger inositol triphosphate which is involved in regulation of certain hormones such as thyroid stimulating hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone as well (95084, 95085). Reduced insulin resistance is also thought to be responsible for improving other symptoms associated with PCOS, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and increased serum testosterone concentrations (2028). Additionally, patients with insulin resistance, including those with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, might have D-chiro-inositol deficiency (2028)."

A prostaglandin-mediated flushing reaction is a common adverse effect of oral niacin. A large pooled analysis of clinical studies shows that up to 70% of people may experience flushing with oral niacin (96211). Although flushing can occur with doses of niacin as low as 30 mg daily, it is more common with the larger doses of 500-2000 mg used for treatment of dyslipidemia (4889, 26089, 93341, 93345).

Niacin can impair glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. Dosages of niacin 3-5 grams daily appear to increase blood glucose in patients with or without diabetes, while dosages of 1.5 grams or less have minimal effects (12033). Because inositol nicotinate is converted to niacin, it may also impair glucose tolerance (496).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, inositol nicotinate is converted to niacin and is therefore likely to cause similar side effects as niacin, including gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, heartburn, diarrhea, and constipation (496).

Increased blood glucose monitoring may be necessary, particularly early in the course of treatment (4859, 4860, 12033).\nless\nGALLBLADDER DISEASE\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. There is concern that niacin might exacerbate active gallbladder disease (15, 496); use with caution.\nless\nGOUT\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. Large amounts of niacin might precipitate gout (12033); use with caution.\nless\nHYPOTENSION\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. There is concern that niacin might exacerbate uncorrected hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. Niacin induces vasodilation and might have additive effects in patients with a predisposition to hypotension (15, 496, 4863, 12033, 93341).\nless\nKIDNEY DISEASE\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. Niacin is excreted unchanged in the urine and might accumulate in patients with kidney disease (15, 496); use with caution.\nless\nLIVER DISEASE\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. There is concern that large doses of niacin might worsen preexisting liver disease. Niacin has been associated with liver damage. Avoid large amounts in patients with a history of liver disease (12026, 12033).\nless\nNIACIN HYPERSENSITIVITY\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body (15, 496).\nless\nPEPTIC ULCER DISEASE\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. There is concern that large amounts of niacin might activate peptic ulcer disease. Niacin is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease and should be used with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (15, 496, 104993).\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nTheoretically, inositol nicotinate may increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Inositol nicotinate may have fibrinolytic effects (496, 1544). Tell patients to discontinue inositol nicotinate at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless\nTENDON XANTHOMAS\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. Some case reports suggests that taking niacin might result in adverse changes in existing xanthomas in some patients, possibly resulting in infection (93348).\nless\nTHYROID DISORDERS\nInositol nicotinate is metabolized to niacin in the body. Evidence from clinical research and case reports suggests that taking niacin can reduce levels of thyroxine-binding globulin by up to 25% and can moderately reduce levels of thyroxine (T4) (25916, 25925, 25926, 25928).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with inositol nicotinate.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral intake, the bioavailability of inositol nicotinate is about 30% lower than that of niacin or niacinamide, which are almost completely absorbed. About 70% of oral inositol nicotinate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (13200). Peak serum levels of nicotinic acid are not achieved until about 10-12 hours after the dose (496). A single dose of inositol nicotinate 1600 mg produces peak free nicotinic acid levels of about 0.6 mcmol/L. This is much lower than the peak level of 244 mcmol/L produced from a single 1000 mg dose of regular niacin (13200).\nMetabolism\nAfter oral intake, the hydrolysis of inositol nicotinate into free nicotinic acid and inositol molecules occurs slowly (496).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nInositol nicotinate consists of six molecules of nicotinic acid (niacin) cross-linked to an inositol molecule (13200).\nCirculatory effects\nIt may take several weeks of therapy to see the full beneficial effects of inositol nicotinate in peripheral vascular disorders such as Raynaud syndrome, suggesting that fibrinolysis, lipid lowering, and vasodilatory action contribute to its beneficial effects (1544, 1545)."

It is an oligosaccharide composed of approximately 60 chains of glucose and fructose molecules. It is found in various plant roots and tubers and is used as a food additive to increase bulk and palatability (8449, 10412, 10414, 93719).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Inulin has Generally Recognized As Safe status (GRAS) in the US (93728).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in supplemental doses, short-term. Doses of 8-18 grams daily have been used safely for up to 24 weeks (7604, 7605, 7606, 7607, 8451, 93716, 93719, 93726, 103200, 107936, 107935, 107938).

Inulin has Generally Recognized As Safe status (GRAS) in the US (93728).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in supplemental doses, short-term. Clinical studies have used doses of 3-6 grams daily for 10 days in children 3-6 years of age and 5-13 grams daily for up to 6 months in children 7-15 years of age with apparent safety (96847, 110598, 110602). ...when used in infant formula. A formula containing chicory fructans (Orafti Synergy1, BENEO GmbH), approximately 50% of which were inulin, has been used with apparent safety in infants for 8-12 months (93717, 107937).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (93728).

There is one report of anaphylaxis following consumption of foods with a high concentration of inulin including salsify, artichoke leaves, and margarine (7608).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Most clinical research shows that oral inulin modestly improves stool frequency, but may not improve discomfort, in adults and children with constipation.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with constipation shows that consuming inulin improves stool frequency by approximately 0.7 stools per week. It also seems to improve stool transit time, consistency, and hardness, but does not reduce pain or bloating (93718). Additional clinical research shows that taking a specific type of inulin (OraftiGR, BENEO GmbH) 12 grams daily in three divided doses for 4 weeks increases stool frequency by approximately one stool per week when compared with a maltodextrin control. Taking inulin also reduces the number of patients experiencing hard and lumpy stools by 13%, but does not improve symptoms of bloating, distension, physical discomfort, or gas (96850). In children aged 2-5 years, one small clinical study shows that taking a specific combination of two inulin products (Orafti P95 oligofructose and Orafti GR inulin, BENEO GmbH), 2 grams twice daily in a dairy liquid for 6 weeks, improves the softness of stools, but not pain with stooling or stool frequency, when compared with a maltodextrin control (96848).\n\nResearch in older adults is conflicting. One small study shows that taking inulin 20-40 grams daily for 19 days increases the number of stools from 1-2 per week to 8-9 per week (10415). However, other preliminary clinical research in this population shows that taking a specific inulin supplement (Fibruline Instant, Cosucra Groupe Warcoing) 15 grams daily in yogurt or stewed fruit for 4 weeks does not improve bowel symptoms, stool frequency, or stool consistency (93724).\nless\nDiabetes. Short-term use of oral inulin along with antidiabetes drugs may improve glycemic control in some patients with type 2 diabetes; however, the benefits of long-term use are unclear.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research in normal weight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking inulin 0.8-10 grams orally daily for 6-12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.65% and fasting plasma glucose by 16 mg/dL when compared with control. Taking inulin also improved HOMA-IR, a measure of insulin resistance, when compared with control. Researchers did not evaluate the most effective dose of inulin; however, most studies used 8.4-10 grams daily (103198, 105533). In females treated with metformin and glyburide, taking inulin 10 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 15 mg/dL and HbA1c by 1% when compared with placebo (93719). Population research in adults has also found that high dietary intake of inulin over 8 years of follow up is associated with a 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes when compared with low dietary intake (110515).\n\nInulin has also been studied in combination with other supplements. Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients with diabetes shows that drinking a milk powder product supplemented with inulin and resistant dextrin 30 grams before breakfast and 15 grams before dinner for 12 weeks decreases fasting plasma glucose by 17 mg/dL, HbA1c by 0.38%, postprandial glucose by 27 mg/dL, body weight by 0.8 kg, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg when compared with placebo (99843). Other clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (Orafti Synergy1, BENEO GmbH), containing 50% inulin and 50% fructo-oligosaccharides, 8 grams orally twice daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight or caloric intake or increase satiety scores when compared with placebo (107934).\nless\nObesity. Oral inulin might modestly improve short-term weight loss. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term effects of inulin on weight loss and weight maintenance in overweight or obese individuals.\nSome clinical research in overweight and obese females with diabetes shows that taking inulin 10 grams daily for 8 weeks results in weight loss of 2.6 kg, compared with no weight loss in those taking placebo (93719). Preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese patients with prediabetes shows that taking a specific brand of inulin (Orafti Synergy 1, BENEO GmbH) 30 grams orally daily for 6 weeks reduces body weight by 0.4 kg, compared with a 0.4 kg increase in those in the control group (93721).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with obesity shows that taking inulin 16 grams orally daily for 3 months moderately reduces body weight and body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo. However, these effects were most prominent in subjects that also increased physical activity (110514). Additional preliminary clinical research in adults with overweight shows that adding 18 grams of inulin powder to green tea daily increases weight loss when compared with green tea alone. Over six weeks, individuals taking inulin lost 2 kg, compared with no weight loss in those taking green tea. Weight loss was maintained for at least 2 weeks (93726).\n\nClinical trials in children show conflicting results. In children aged 7-12 years, a small clinical study shows that taking a specific oligofructose-enriched inulin product (Orafti Synergy1, BENEO GmbH) 8 grams orally in water before one meal daily for 16 weeks decreases weight gain by 2.4-fold and attenuates an increase in BMI when compared with placebo (96847). However, other preliminary clinical research in children with obesity aged 7-15 years shows that taking inulin extract 13 grams orally daily for 6 months does not reduce body weight or BMI when compared with placebo (110598).\n\nHowever, other clinical research shows that taking inulin orally in combination with other ingredients might not improve weight loss. Combining inulin, chromium picolinate, capsicum, L-phenylalanine, and other nutrients with caloric reduction and exercise doesn't seem to reduce weight in moderately obese patients when compared to caloric reduction and exercise alone (7607). Another preliminary clinical trial shows that taking inulin 10 grams with maltodextrin 10 grams daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or improve body composition when compared with placebo in adults with overweight or obesity following a calorie-restricted diet (103202). Preliminary clinical research in adults with obesity also shows that consuming a seafood-based dietary product fortified with inulin 1.7 grams, fish oil 370 mg (containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and bifidobacterium animalis daily for 12 weeks does not lower body weight, waist circumference, abdominal fat, serum cholesterol levels, or blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, consuming the product modestly improved some markers of insulin resistance (110600).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with alcohol use disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with alcohol use disorder who were recently admitted to the hospital shows that taking a specific inulin product (Fibruline, Cosucra) 4-16 grams orally daily for 17 days does not improve liver function tests when compared with placebo. Some liver function tests were also worse in those treated with inulin (110601).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral inulin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6 months to 14 years receiving antibiotics for common infections shows that taking a combination of inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides, up to 5 grams daily depending on age, does not reduce the rate of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (93720).\nless\nCeliac disease. Small clinical studies suggest that patients with celiac disease who take oral inulin may have a lower risk of vitamin and mineral deficiency.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of children and adolescents with vitamin and mineral malabsorption due to celiac disease shows that taking a specific oligofructose-enriched inulin product (Orafti Synergy 1, BENEO GmbH) 10 grams daily for 3 months improves the absorption of vitamin D, vitamin E, and iron, but not vitamin A (99841, 99842). Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and vitamin E increased by 42% and 19%, respectively, compared with no significant improvements in those taking placebo (99842). Although taking inulin did not improve serum ferritin levels, it did decrease serum hepcidin concentrations by 61% when compared with baseline, while no significant improvement was reported with placebo. Hepcidin is a regulator of iron homeostasis, and increased levels are associated with iron-deficiency anemia (99841).\nless\nChild growth. Oral inulin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, exclusively formula-fed, infants less than 4 months of age shows that supplementing formula with 0.8 grams/dL of a specific combination product (Orafti Synergy1, Beneo-Orafti) containing 50% inulin and 50% fructo-oligosaccharide until 12 months of age does not improve markers of child growth, including body weight, length, and head circumference, when compared with placebo. The combination product was associated with a reduced duration of fever during infectious episodes, but not with a reduction in the number of infections. It is unclear if any potential effects are due to inulin, fructo-oligosaccharide, or the combination (107937).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with CKD.\nIn adults with CKD, adding inulin 19 grams daily for 6 months to a low-protein diet reduces serum insulin, fasting plasma glucose, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and markers of systemic inflammation, while increasing serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with baseline (105534). However, it is unclear if similar changes occur with a low-protein diet alone, or if the rate of progression of CKD is reduced. Population research in adults has found that high dietary intake of inulin over 8 years of follow up is not associated with a lower risk of CKD when compared with low dietary intake (110515).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral inulin reduces cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nResearch in patients with hypercholesterolemia has shown mixed results, with some studies showing a small decrease and others showing no improvement in serum cholesterol levels (7604, 8450, 10412, 10413, 96849). A typical dose of inulin used is 6 grams orally three times daily for up to 6 weeks (10412). A meta-analysis of healthy, dyslipidemic, overweight or diabetic patients shows that inulin reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by approximately 5% (96849). Another meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in the same population shows that taking inulin 1.5-30 grams daily for 2-12 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 2 mg/mL when compared with control. However, this meta-analysis also included data from patients treated with fructo-oligosaccharides instead of inulin (107940).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nPopulation research in adults has found that high dietary intake of inulin over 8 years of follow up is associated with a 21% lower risk of hypertension when compared with low dietary intake (110515).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in normal and moderately hyperlipidemic patients suggests that taking inulin-type fructans at an approximate average dose of 14 grams daily reduces triglyceride levels by about 15 mg/dL when compared with control (93737). However, other research, including a meta-analysis of healthy, dyslipidemic, overweight or diabetic patients shows that taking inulin 1.5-30 grams daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with control. However, these negative studies are limited by small sample sizes and inclusion of data from patients treated with fructo-oligosaccharides instead of inulin (7604, 107940).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Several small clinical studies suggest that oral inulin is not beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with prediabetes shows that taking inulin 15 grams orally daily for 24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or lipid levels when compared with placebo. However, taking inulin modestly improved markers of insulin resistance (107938). Two other, small, clinical trials show that taking specific inulin products (Orafti Synergy 1, BENEO GmbH or Frutafit IQ, Sensus American) 10-30 grams daily for 6 weeks does not improve blood glucose, insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, or insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (93721, 107936). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. Oral inulin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in young adult females with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking inulin 963 mg/kg and iron supplementation orally daily for 3 months modestly improves serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron levels when compared with a control group consuming iron-fortified flour (110599).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults experiencing menopause shows that consuming yogurt enriched with a specific inulin (Frutafit TEX, Sensus Company) 1.5% daily for 6 weeks moderately improves menopausal symptom scores, including depression, anxiety, and vasomotor symptoms, when compared with yogurt alone (107659).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Taking oral inulin alone does not seem to improve liver transaminase levels in patients with NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with NAFLD shows that taking metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for one week plus inulin 4 grams twice daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase when compared with placebo. However, when inulin is taken without metronidazole, these measures are not improved (103200).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral inulin is beneficial in patients with PCOS.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight or obese females with PCOS shows that taking specific products containing inulin (FrutaFit TEX, Sensus American) or inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FrutaFit IQ, Sensus American) 10 grams orally once daily for 12 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this study is limited by the inclusion of subjects with and without hypertension at baseline (107941).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate inulin for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nInulin has been used in various combination products. Typical dosing for inulin alone is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn one clinical trial, a specific inulin product (Fibruline Instant; Cosucra Groupe Warcoing) containing 15 grams inulin per sachet was standardized to contain a minimum of 90% dietary fiber (93724).

            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCALCIUM\nInulin may increase calcium absorption, although this effect is not likely to be clinically significant.\nAnimal research shows that taking inulin with calcium modestly increases calcium absorption (103719, 103720). However, inulin appears to have no clinically significant effect on the absorption of dietary calcium. Inulin does not seem to affect ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, or calcium excretion (8451, 10274).\nless\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nTheoretically, inulin might have hypoglycemic effects.\nTaking inulin with other supplements with hypoglycemic potential might increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with inulin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nInulin is not digested or absorbed. Instead it promotes the growth of specific types of bacteria in the large intestine (7605, 8447, 10414, 96836, 96847). These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed and metabolized (8449).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nInulin is an oligosaccharide, composed of up to approximately 60 chains of glucose and fructose molecules. The major sources of inulin in the diet are wheat, onions, bananas, leaks, artichokes, and asparagus (10412, 10414). For supplements, inulin is usually obtained by hot water extraction from chicory root (7606, 93724). Because it contributes very little in dietary calories, inulin is used as a food additive to increase bulk and palatability (8449). Inulin is related to short-chain oligosaccharides (SCOs), which are often referred to as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). Partial hydrolysis of the longer chain inulin yields SCOs, which are usually 2 to 7 sugar molecules in length and have many of the same effects as inulin (7606). Inulin-like fructans consist of inulin, oligofructose, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) (96849).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome research suggests that inulin decreases levels of some inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6 (93719, 96847). The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin may be related to its prebiotic effects (93719). A small clinical study in overweight or obese females with PCOS shows that taking inulin 10 grams orally once daily for 12 weeks reduces serum levels of CRP, but not nitric oxide or endothelin-1, when compared with placebo (107941).\nAntihypertensive effects\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy shows that taking inulin 15 grams daily for 21 days decreases systolic blood pressure by 9.6 mmHg but does not improve diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (103199). The mechanism of inulin's antihypertensive effect is unclear.\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using inulin to improve colonic inflammation and gastrointestinal symptoms. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that consuming a diet high in short-chain fatty acids, including inulin 8 grams, high amylose maize starch 20 grams, and apple cider vinegar daily, does not improve bowel movements or stool scores when compared with a diet low in short-chain fatty acids. However, the diet high in short-chain fatty acids did modestly reduce blood levels of circulating B cells and T cells (110603).\n\nMany studies in generally healthy infants, children, and adults show that taking inulin orally for 7-252 days increases the gastrointestinal abundance of Bifidobacterium and stool frequency when compared with control. However, these effects were not demonstrated in groups with baseline gastrointestinal disorders. In addition, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity (110514, 110516).\nGlycemic effects\nInulin is considered a non-digestible carbohydrate. Because of this, it does not contribute to the glycemic response upon consumption. Replacing digestible carbohydrates in foods with inulin leads to a lower post-prandial glycemic response (99845). Inulin has been shown to upregulate gene expression and secretion of ghrelin and somatostatin, which might improve glycemic control through regulation of food intake and delayed gastric emptying, respectively (99843).\nHypolipidemic effects\nInulin is fermented in the gut to short-chain fatty acids, which promote the oxidation of fat (99844). Inulin decreases serum triglycerides by decreasing fatty acid synthesis and reducing production of very low density lipoproteins (7604, 8448).\nPrebiotic effects\nInulin has a prebiotic effect, meaning that it is not digested or absorbed, but instead promotes the growth of specific types of bacteria in the large intestine. Inulin has been suggested to preferentially promote the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus (10414, 93717, 93724, 96836, 96847, 96848). Some clinical research in humans shows that taking oral inulin increases gut and fecal microbiota diversity; however, not all research agrees (107939).\n\nFermentation of inulin decreases fecal pH and increases fecal volume (7605, 8447, 10414). The products of fermentation are short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed and metabolized (8449). In human research, an increase in measurable short-chain fatty acids was not observed, possibly due to quick absorption (96836, 107939).\n\nInulin also appears to increase levels of plasma isoflavones in patients given soy isoflavone supplements. The prebiotic effects of inulin potentially play a role. It is possible that inulin increases the growth of bacteria that produce the enzyme glucosidase, resulting in easier absorption of the isoflavones (93725).\nWeight loss effects\nInulin's' effects on body weight are thought to be due to increased expression of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and reduced plasma ghrelin levels. Increased expression and secretion of GLP-1 produces delayed gastric emptying and increased feelings of satiety. Reduced ghrelin levels may reduce hunger (93722, 93723). However, in older adults with overweight or obesity, taking inulin 10 grams prior to a meal does not decrease energy intake at the meal (96851)."

            "Overview": "Iodine is a nonmetallic trace element that is needed for the production of thyroid hormone (16747, 91396). Iodine deficiency is a common world health problem and is thought to be the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The addition of iodine to salt has greatly reduced the prevalence of deficiency in the US and Canada (7135, 16747). Dietary sources of iodine other than iodized salt include seaweed and other marine products, eggs, and cow's milk (91396, 91398).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Iodine is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1100 mcg daily (7135, 103070). Higher doses can be safely used with appropriate medical monitoring (2197, 7080). In some regions of the world, such as Japan, daily dietary intake is estimated to be as high as 5,280-13,800 mcg without adverse outcomes (16747). ...when used topically and appropriately, as a 2% solution. A 2% iodine solution is an FDA-approved prescription product (15).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Tell patients to avoid prolonged use of doses exceeding the UL of 1100 mcg daily without proper medical supervision. There is concern that higher intake can increase the risk of side effects such as thyroid dysfunction, as well as thyroiditis, thyroid papillary cancer, thyrotoxicosis, and atrial fibrillation (7135, 55962, 56013). However, in some regions of the world such as Japan, daily dietary intake is estimated to be as high as 5,280-13,800 mcg without adverse outcomes (16747).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (7135). Iodine is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 200 mcg daily for children 1-3 years, 300 mcg daily for children 4-8 years, 600 mcg daily for children 9-13 years, and 900 mcg daily for adolescents (7135). ...when used topically as a 2% solution (15). Iodine is an FDA-approved prescription product.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL (7135, 108709). Higher intake can cause thyroid dysfunction (7135) and may be associated with a modest reduction in intelligence (108709).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Iodine is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1100 mcg daily in those 18 years and older or 900 mcg daily in those 14-18 years of age (7135, 103070). Iodine needs increase during pregnancy and lactation and adequate intakes should begin as soon as a patient is aware of the pregnancy, or earlier in areas of potential deficiency (17920). ...when used topically as a 2% solution (15). Iodine is an FDA-approved prescription product.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL. Higher intake can cause thyroid dysfunction (7135). Also, higher intakes during pregnancy cause increased iodine levels in breast milk and infant blood samples. Higher iodine intake during pregnancy has also been associated with an increased risk of congenital hypothyroidism and reduced mental and physical development in the offspring (56089, 91390, 91394, 91395).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, iodine is well tolerated when taken in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) or when used therapeutically with appropriate medical monitoring (2197, 7080, 7135).\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal upset, diarrhea, goiter, headache, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, metallic taste, nausea, rhinorrhea, thyroid adenoma.\n\nTopically: Burns, dermatitis, irritation.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll ROAs: Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema.\nDermatologic\nOrally, taking iodine chronically or in large amounts has been reported to cause acneform skin lesions called iododerma (2138). In one case, a patient developed iododerma after consuming a specific product (Hoxsey's Brown Tonic) containing an unspecified quantity of potassium iodide. After several months of consumption, the patient developed acneform skin lesions on the nose, cheeks, and upper back and presented with a urine iodine level of 7,455,647 ug/L (reference range: 34-523 ug/L). After discontinuation of potassium iodide, the lesions resolved gradually over the course of several weeks (95431).\n\nTopically, iodine may stain skin, irritate tissues, and cause sensitization in some individuals (15, 56106). Iodine burns are associated with application of 7% hydroalcoholic solution (15). Povidone-iodine may cause contact dermatitis or irritant reactions in some people. However, patch testing with potassium iodide is usually negative in these patients, indicating that contact dermatitis caused by topical iodine does not indicate a propensity for reaction to oral potassium iodide (93001).\nless\nEndocrine\nProlonged use and/or large oral doses of iodine intake can cause thyroid gland hyperplasia, thyroid adenoma, goiter, and hypothyroidism (15, 56013, 56089, 91397, 91398, 99793, 99795). In another case report, an infant presented with reversible hypothyroidism at birth because the mother had consumed excessive seaweed soup during and after pregnancy, which resulted in excessive iodine consumption (99795). Iodine has also been linked to rare cases of adverse events. In one case report, a 56-year-old male developed thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis thought to be related to excessive intake of iodine (91401).\n\nTopically, using povidone-iodine (PI) 1% solution as a gargle and nasal spray, in addition to intranasal application of PI 10% ointment over 5 days, can precipitate subclinical hypothyroidism, with elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal thyroid hormone levels. TSH levels seem to normalize about 7-12 days after stopping topical PI application (105877).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, the commonly reported adverse effects of a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) are nausea (14%), abdominal pain (14%), metallic taste (4%), and diarrhea (4%) (17561). These side effects can be minimized by avoiding quick dosage increases (17574). Taking iodine chronically or in large amounts has also been reported to cause soreness in teeth and gums, burning in mouth and throat, increased salivation, swelling of parotid and submaxillary glands, inflammation of the respiratory tract, gastric upset, and diarrhea (15, 2138).\n\nIntranasally, applying povidone-iodine 1% solution along with a 10% ointment can cause unpleasant nasal tingling (105877).\nless\nImmunologic\nPeople who are allergic to iodine-containing foods or drugs are sometimes stated to have \"iodine allergy\", but the actual allergen is another agent such as seafood proteins or radiocontrast media (93001). However, some people can be hypersensitive to iodine when used orally. Symptoms of hypersensitivity can include angioedema, cutaneous and mucosal hemorrhage, fever, arthralgia, lymph node enlargement, eosinophilia, urticaria, erythema, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (15, 17561). Other reported side effects include potassium toxicity, metabolic acidosis, pustular psoriasis, and vasculitis (17574). However, such sensitivity is very rare (93001). Orally, iodine hypersensitivity can cause fatal periarteritis (15).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, common side effects of a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) have included headache (7%) (17561). Side effects can be minimized by avoiding quick dosage increases (17574).\n\nHigh intake of iodine may be associated with adverse cognitive outcomes in children. Observational research in children aged 7-14 years has found that those consuming drinking water with iodine concentrations above 900 mcg/L daily, which exceeds the tolerable upper intake level, is associated with a 1.6-point reduction in intelligence level when compared with those consuming water with iodine concentrations below 300 mcg/L (108709).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, taking iodine chronically or in large amounts has been reported to cause eye irritation and eyelid swelling (15, 2138).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, common side effects of a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) included rhinorrhea (11%) (17561). Side effects can be minimized by avoiding quick dosage increases (17574). Taking iodine chronically or in large amounts has also been reported to cause coryza, sneezing, cough, and pulmonary edema (15, 2138). Ophthalmically, povidone-iodine 5% solution 3 drops administered in each eye has been reported to slow respiration by about 18 seconds (range 4 to 96 seconds) when compared with saline control in children ages 2-17 years undergoing strabismus surgery (103077).\nless\nRenal\nWhen povidone-iodine was used in renal pelvic instillation sclerotherapy, one patient (2%) had significant flank pain during treatment (55970).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nIodine deficiency. Oral iodine supplements, including iodized salt, are effective for improving iodine status and reducing goiter size in adults and children. Iodine supplementation is also recommended during pregnancy in areas at risk for iodine deficiency.\nIodine deficiency is associated with several adverse outcomes. The earliest clinical symptom of iodine deficiency is low circulating thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), followed by thyroid goiter (7135, 16747, 91398). Iodine deficiency and subsequent hypothyroidism can lead to anovulation, infertility, autoimmune thyroiditis, and gestational hypertension. Iodine deficiency is also associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer (16747). Clinical research shows that taking iodine supplements, including iodized salt, improves iodine status and reduces goiter size in adults with iodine deficiency (16747, 55919, 103071). Studies also show that taking iodine supplementation, including iodized salt, in areas of endemic iodine deficiency, reduces goiter size in children (16747, 55919).\n\nWhen taken during pregnancy for iodine deficiency, iodine supplements and iodized salt reduce both maternal and newborn thyroid size and thyroglobulin; however, the effect on maternal TSH is inconsistent (91399, 103070). Although some clinical studies and one analysis show that perinatal use of iodine has no effect on the incidence of thyroid disorders during pregnancy (91399, 97240, 97241), one analysis shows that iodine supplementation reduces the risk of postpartum hyperthyroidism by 68% when compared with placebo (97240). Taking iodine supplementation before 12 weeks' gestation appears to be more effective than when taken later in pregnancy. Perinatal iodine supplementation has no effect on preterm birth rate (97240, 97241). Evidence is limited to females with mild-moderate iodine deficiency; the routine use of iodine supplementation during pregnancy has not been extensively studied. For example, the effect of perinatal supplementation on newborn neurocognitive development is conflicting and the evidence is generally low quality (55976, 97241, 105880, 108706). Despite the limited evidence, iodine supplementation is recommended in areas at risk of deficiency.\nless\nRadiation exposure. Oral potassium iodide prevents thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine. However, it does not protect against other sources of radiation.\nTaking potassium iodide is effective for preventing the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid (7517, 7518). Doses of potassium iodide protect for about 24 hours. Therefore, it should be taken daily until the risk of radiation exposure no longer exists (17575, 17576).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConjunctivitis. Ophthalmic povidone-iodine solution seems to reduce the risk of conjunctivitis in infants. It may also improve the resolution of acute conjunctivitis in adults. It is unclear if it is beneficial in patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical trials shows that povidone-iodine solutions are more effective than silver nitrate for preventing neonatal conjunctivitis. However, povidone-iodine solutions are not more effective than erythromycin or chloramphenicol (56084). Povidone-iodine in combination with dexamethasone also seems to be helpful in adults. A clinical trial in patients with acute viral conjunctivitis shows that applying povidone-iodine 0.6% with dexamethasone 0.1% four times daily for 4 days improves clinical symptoms and eradiation of viral counts when compared with placebo control (103075).\n\nA small clinical study in adults with adenoviral conjunctivitis shows that administering 4-5 drops of a povidone-iodine 5% eye drop solution within 4 days of symptom onset decreases viral load, mucoid discharge, and bulbar edema and redness on day 4 of a 21-day follow-up period, but at no other time points, when compared with a single dose of artificial tears (108705). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of continued administration are unclear.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Topical iodine seems to help with the management of diabetic foot ulcer wounds.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that topically applying cadexomer iodine ointment (Iodosorb) for 12 weeks seems to improve healing to a similar degree as using standard treatment with gentamicin solution, streptokinase, and/or dry saline gauze (2200).\nless\nEndometritis. Topical application of iodine prior to cesarean delivery seems to reduce the risk of endometritis.\nA meta-analysis of eight clinical trials shows that vaginally applying povidone-iodine 1% to 10% solution immediately before cesarean delivery reduces the risk of post-cesarean endometritis by 62% when compared with saline or no cleaning. It also reduces postoperative fever by 13% and wound infection by 23% (99794). These findings are consistent with other meta-analyses (56080, 103076). There seems to be no difference in benefit whether povidone-iodine 1%, 5%, or 10% is used. A network meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients having cesarean delivery suggests that povidone-iodine is no better at preventing endometritis than using chlorhexidine or metronidazole; however, there may not have been sufficient power to detect a difference (103076).\nless\nFibrocystic breast disease. Oral iodine seems to reduce breast pain in patients with fibrocystic breast disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with fibrocystic breast disease shows that taking sodium iodide, protein bound iodide, or molecular iodine for 6 months or longer improves mastalgia and reduces breast nodules when compared with baseline or control. Molecular iodine in doses of 70-90 mcg/kg appears to be more effective and better tolerated than the other forms (2197). Another clinical study in patients with cyclic mastalgia due to fibrocystic breast disease shows that taking tablets containing molecular iodine 3000-6000 mcg daily for 5 months reduces pain, tenderness, and nodularity in patients with cyclic mastalgia when compared with placebo. However, a lower dose of 1500 mcg daily does not appear to be beneficial (55960).\nless\nOral mucositis. Rinsing the mouth with a povidone-iodine solution may prevent oral mucositis from radiochemotherapy.\nSmall clinical studies in patients receiving radiation and chemotherapy for cancer shows that using an oral povidone-iodine rinse seems to reduce the risk for oral mucositis when compared with using sterile water (2198, 2199).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Rinsing with povidone-iodine solution in addition to scaling and root planing seems to be modestly beneficial in patients with periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small clinical studies in patients with chronic periodontitis suggests that rinsing with povidone-iodine 0.1% to 10% during scaling and root planing modestly reduces the periodontal pocket depth when compared with rinsing with water or saline solution (56072).\nless\nPostoperative infection. Povidone-iodine antisepsis prevents postoperative infection when compared with inactive controls such as normal saline and water. However, it is unclear how it compares to active controls such as chlorhexidine; practice guidelines are conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intraoperative application of povidone-iodine reduces the risk of surgical site infection by approximately 40% when compared with saline or no irrigation (56088). However, research comparing povidone-iodine with other antiseptics such as chlorhexidine is conflicting, as are official guidelines for surgical antisepsis. Many of these discrepancies seem to be related to the presence or absence of alcohol in the preparation. A meta-analysis of clinical research comparing aqueous or alcohol-based povidone-iodine shows that using alcohol-based chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis is more effective for preventing postoperative surgical site infections and may be associated with a lower overall positive culture rate. However, since evidence for both aqueous and alcohol-based solutions of povidone-iodine were included in this study, it is unclear if this may have affected outcomes (108710). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guideline recommends chlorhexidine solution as the first choice for preparing the skin for surgery, with povidone-iodine solution as a second-line option. The antiseptic solutions are recommended to be alcohol-based as long as the surgical site is not near a mucous membrane (105906). The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines also recommend alcohol-based chlorhexidine solutions over either alcohol-based or aqueous povidone-iodine for preventing surgical site infections. However, some experts have expressed concern that these recommendations are based on faulty evidence, as some studies used povidone-iodine preparations with lower alcohol amounts than their comparator groups (105898). In fact, the guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not differentiate between povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine antiseptic solutions as long as they are alcohol-based (105905).\nless\nThyroid storm. Oral iodine is recommended as an adjunct to standard treatment for thyroid storm.\nThe American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommend a multimodality approach for treating thyroid storm that includes taking five drops of a saturated solution of potassium iodine every 6 hours (15, 92699).\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Topical cadexomer iodine seems to improve the healing of venous leg ulcers; however, it is unclear if applying povidone-iodine is beneficial.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical studies in patients with venous leg ulcers shows that applying cadexomer iodine results in complete healing of ulcers in 33% of patients after 4-12 weeks, compared with only 15% of patients receiving standard care alone. However, use of cadexomer iodine was associated with more adverse effects than standard care. Furthermore, preliminary clinical research shows that applying cadexomer iodine is comparable to hydrocolloid dressing, paraffin gauze dressing, dextranomer, and silver-impregnated dressings for improving the rate of complete healing. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research show that povidone-iodine has comparable healing rates when compared with amoxicillin, hydrocolloid dressings, and moist or foam dressings (99798). These findings were consistent with an older version of this meta-analysis (56076).\nless\nThyroid nodules. Combining oral iodine with thyroxine seems to improve the resolution of thyroid nodules.\nA clinical study in patients with benign nodular thyroid disease and possible iodine deficiency shows that taking iodized salt 200 mcg daily in addition to thyroxine 1.5 mcg/kg daily after surgery seems to reduce the size of the thyroid remnant by 40%, compared with a 10% reduction in patients given thyroxine alone (55927). Also, one large clinical trial in patients with nodular goiter shows that taking potassium iodide 150 mcg daily in combination with levothyroxine 50-100 mcg daily for 12 months reduces nodule volume by about 17%, compared with 7% in the group using levothyroxine alone (91392).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCatheter-related infections. Topical povidone-iodine seems to be less effective than chlorhexidine for preventing infections from intravascular catheters. Furthermore, it does not seem to reduce the risk of catheter-related urinary tract infections.\nOne meta-analysis of clinical research shows that topical application of povidone-iodine reduces the risk of bloodstream infections when applied at the insertion site of hemodialysis central venous catheters (55883). However, disinfecting catheter insertion sites using povidone-iodine seems to be less effective for preventing blood stream infections in patients receiving central venous, pulmonary artery, or peripheral artery catheters when compared with chlorhexidine solutions (55883, 55916).\n\nIn addition, periurethral cleansing with povidone-iodine 10% prior to bladder catheterization, as well as bladder irrigation with povidone-iodine 2% prior to urinary catheter removal, does not seem to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections when compared with placebo (56058, 56126).\nless\nPrematurity. Maternal iodine supplementation does not seem to impact neurological development in premature infants.\nA meta-analysis of two clinical trials in premature infants shows that adding iodine to enteral or parenteral feeds does not improve mental, visual, or auditory development or reduce the risk of death when compared with no iodine supplementation (99797).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nChyluria. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial in patients with chyluria.\nA small clinical study in patients with chyluria suggests that using povidone-iodine 0.2% solution as a sclerosant in renal pelvic instillation sclerotherapy (RPIS) may be as effective as using silver nitrate 1% (55970).\nless\nCorneal ulceration. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial in patients with corneal ulceration.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administering povidone-iodine 2.5% eye drops every two hours for two weeks in addition to standard antibiotic therapy does not reduce visual impairment in patients with corneal ulcers when compared with standard antibiotic therapy alone (55971).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if rinsing with a povidone-iodine mouthwash and using a povidone-iodine nasal spray and ointment can reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nA small clinical study in adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 shows that orally swishing and gargling 25 mL of povidone-iodine (PI) 1% solution, then, into each nostril, spraying 2.5 mL of PI 1% solution and applying one dab of PI 10% ointment, and repeating this 4 times daily for 5 days does not seem to alter the quantity of viral RNA over time when compared with control (105877). The validity of this finding is limited because all study participants achieved negative viral titers on the third day of the study.\nless\nCutaneous sporotrichosis. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial in patients with cutaneous sporotrichosis; research is conflicting.\nAnecdotal reports and case series suggest that taking saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) orally is effective for most patients when used alone or in combination with another antifungal, including terbinafine or itraconazole (17562, 17563, 17564, 17565, 17566, 17567, 17568, 17569, 17570, 17571) (17572, 17573). In one non-controlled clinical study, treatment with SSKI, starting with 3 drops (150 mg potassium iodide) daily and titrating up, resulted in symptom resolution in about 90% of patients after about 33 days of treatment (17561). However, some patients are not able to take SSKI due to intolerable side effects (17561, 17572).\nless\nHyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral potassium iodide is beneficial for patients with Graves' disease undergoing total thyroidectomy.\nA retrospective study in patients with Graves' disease undergoing total thyroidectomy shows that preoperative administration of saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) 5% does not reduce the rate of postoperative complications, such as transient or permanent hypoparathyroidism, transient recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy, definitive RLN palsy, and cervical hematoma, when compared with no preoperative administration (108707).\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if maternal iodine supplementation impacts neurological development in infants.\nThree-year follow-up data from a clinical study in infants and breastfeeding females shows that maternal supplementation of iodine 150 mcg daily improves child cognitive scores, but does not affect language or motor scores, when compared with placebo. Supplementation with a higher dose of 300 mcg daily yielded similar cognitive, language, and motor scores as the 150 mcg dose (108706). This finding aligns with the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 290 mcg during lactation, which is sometimes achieved by augmenting the diet with a 150-mcg iodine supplement (7135).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial in patients with rhinosinusitis.\nA small prospective cohort study in patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis has found that using a povidone-iodine 0.08% nasal rinse every other day for 7 weeks in addition to standard therapy improves symptoms and reduces signs of infection when compared with baseline (103074). However, one small clinical study in patients with a history of sinus surgery and acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis shows that receiving povidone-iodine nasal irrigations twice daily for 30 days is no different than irrigations with mupirocin or normal saline for improving nasal symptoms. However, mupirocin tended to reduce bacteria count to a greater extent than the povidone-iodine solution (105878). This finding is limited due to small study size and potential lack of power to detect differences between groups.\nless\nThyroid cancer. It is unclear if dietary iodine is associated with complications in patients with papillary thyroid cancer.\nA retrospective study in patients in China with papillary thyroid cancer has found that dietary intake of iodine resulting in serum concentrations greater than 90 mcg/L is associated with a 75% increased risk of cervical lymph node metastases when compared with concentrations less than 45 mcg/L (108708). Actual dietary intake of iodine was not reported, limiting the validity of this finding.\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is unclear if oral iodine rinse is beneficial for the prevention of VAP.\nA small clinical study in patients with severe head trauma suggests that regularly rinsing the throat with 20 mL of povidone-iodine 10% solution decreases the risk for VAP when compared with using a saline rinse (56003).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial for wound healing.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that topical iodine, as cadexomer iodine or povidone-iodine, is superior to non-antiseptic dressings and some antiseptic agents, such as silver sulfadiazine, for reducing wound size. However, iodine seems to be less effective than local antibiotics such as rifamycin (56083).\nless\nPostoperative bleeding. It is unclear if topical iodine is beneficial in patients with postoperative bleeding.\nA small clinical study suggests that irrigating extraction sockets with povidone-iodine 1% stops bleeding in a greater number of patients following tooth extraction when compared with a saline solution (56011).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate iodine for these uses.",

For children, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) by age is: 1-8 years, 90 mcg daily; 9-13 years, 120 mcg daily; 14 years and older, 150 mcg daily (7135). During pregnancy, the RDA is 220 mcg daily; during lactation, the RDA is 290 mcg daily (7135). Dosing of supplemental iodine varies; see Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIodine exists in several forms including potassium and sodium salts, as well as inorganic or organic forms (16747). Potassium iodide is one of the most common salt forms used. It is made up of 76% halogen iodine and 23% alkali metal potassium. This form of iodine is usually used as a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI), which contains 47 mg of potassium iodide per drop of solution (17574). Lugol's solution is another common form of iodine. It contains 5% molecular iodine and 10% potassium iodide in solution (16747).\n\nIn clinical trials, iodine is often taken orally as iodized salt (55919, 91399). Topically, iodine is often applied as solutions or ointments containing povidone-iodine 0.1% to 10% (2198, 2199, 2200, 56072). Chemically, povidone-iodine is a stable complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone, PVP) and elemental iodine (92700). A specific povidone-iodine 10% solution (Betadine 10% solution) has been used as a throat rinse and for colonic irrigation (56003, 56153).",

Avoid iodine in these patients.\nless\nTHYROID DISEASE\nExcessive iodine can exacerbate thyroid dysfunction. Prolonged use or excessive amounts of iodides may cause or exacerbate thyroid gland hyperplasia, thyroid adenoma, Graves' disease, goiter, and hypothyroidism (15, 91393). Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) may have increased sensitivity to the adverse effects of iodine (7135, 91393). Also, a retrospective study in patients with papillary thyroid cancer has found that dietary intake of iodine resulting in serum concentrations greater than 90 mcg/L is associated with a 75% increased risk of cervical lymph node metastases when compared with concentrations less than 45 mcg/L (108708).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, taking iodine chronically or in large amounts can cause various adverse effects, including soreness in teeth and gums, burning in mouth and throat, increased salivation, coryza, eye irritation and eyelid swelling, pulmonary edema, swelling of parotid and submaxillary glands, inflammation of the respiratory tract, acneform skin lesions, gastric upset, diarrhea, anorexia, and depression (15, 2138).\n\nSystemic exposure to povidone-iodine intended for topical use can cause toxicity with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and cyanosis. In one case report, a 17-year-old male reported to the emergency room with hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia after accidentally consuming povidone-iodine that was mistaken for a coffee drink (15, 2138, 105879).\n\nOrally, overdose with potassium iodate 187 mg/kg or more can cause retinal toxicity and vision loss. In one case report, a 42-year-old male ingested 2 cups of pure iodine as a suicide attempt and was admitted to the emergency room with bilateral irreversible vision loss (105700).\nTreatment\nToxicity from systemic exposure to povidone-iodine has been treated with emergency endotracheal intubation along with intravenous furosemide for edema (105879). Vision loss from potassium iodate toxicity has been treated with prednisolone and vitamins B1, B2, and B6, increasing vision recovery in some patients (105700).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, iodine is absorbed through the stomach and duodenum (17920). Iodine absorption from milk with high intrinsic iodine (inorganic iodide), milk fortified with iodine, and aqueous iodine solution, seems to be about the same (range 72% to 98%) in humans (103078). From seaweed, oral potassium iodide has been found to be almost completely (96.4%) absorbed in humans (55922). When applied topically, iodine can be absorbed through intact skin (56056, 91396).\nDistribution\nThe thyroid gland concentrates about 30% of the body's iodine (7135, 17574), which is incorporated into thyroid hormones (91396, 17920). Iodine comprises 65% of thyroxine (T4) and 59% of triiodothyronine (T3) (16747). Lesser amounts of iodine are found in the salivary glands, breast, choroid plexus, and gastric mucosa tissues (7135, 17574). Iodine is also available in breast milk (55888).\nMetabolism\nWhen taken orally, iodine is converted to iodide (91396).\nExcretion\nIodine is excreted mainly in the urine, with small amounts in feces, sweat, and saliva (16747, 7135, 17574, 16747, 91396, 91397). Loss in urine appears to increase during pregnancy (17920).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIodine is an essential nutrient in humans. The iodine content of most foods is low and is affected by agricultural factors such as soil quality and climate. Most iodine is found in the oceans. Coastal soils have higher soil concentrations of iodine than inland soils. Marine animals concentrate iodine from seawater and have a higher content than most other foods (7135). Seaweed, which is commonly consumed in Asian cultures, also contains a high concentration of iodine (16747). Processed foods may add to dietary iodine due to the addition of iodate to salt. In North America, average daily iodine intake is 167 mcg. In other regions, such as Japan, average daily intake is estimated to be about 5280 mcg to 13,800 mcg (16747).\nAntimicrobial effects\nWhen used topically, iodine oxidizes organic substrates, killing microorganisms (15).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn some tissues, iodine can have an antioxidant effect (16747, 91396). It is thought that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, peroxidase, and some unsaturated fatty acids, iodine donates an electron, thus decreasing damage due to oxygen free radicals (91396).\nEndocrine effects\nThe thyroid gland in humans concentrates about 30% of the body's iodine for thyroid hormone synthesis (7135, 17574). Iodine comprises 65% of thyroxine (T4) and 59% of triiodothyronine (T3). These iodine-rich thyroid hormones control many biochemical reactions, particularly protein synthesis and enzymatic processes. In people with hyperthyroidism, iodine inhibits the release and synthesis of thyroid hormone (16747).\nHemostatic effects\nClinical research suggests that povidone-iodine solution helps stops bleeding associated with tooth extraction. This effect has been attributed to the oxidizing potential of iodine resulting in corrosion, as well as the thickening and granulating properties of povidone (56011).\nNeurological effects\nThyroid hormone is responsible for myelination of the developing central nervous system. As a result, iodine deficiency is associated with intellectual disability, which in some cases can be severe (7135). Most developed countries, including the US and Canada, screen for hypothyroidism at birth (7135).\nRadioprotective effects\nIodine in the form of potassium iodide can block or reduce the accumulation of radioactive iodine and damage to the thyroid gland if taken prior to or immediately following exposure to radioactive iodine (7517, 7518).\nRespiratory effects\nIodide salts, such as potassium iodide, might increase respiratory tract secretions and thereby decrease mucus viscosity, but there is limited supporting evidence for this effect (15)."

However, other scientists claim that the structure of the molecule would require a transporter, although no transporters have been found. The most recent evidence involving a direct measurement of IP-6 suggests that it is not detectable in human plasma.\nMetabolism\nDietary or supplemental IP-6 is most likely metabolized in the gut to inositol prior to absorption (97610, 97611).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIP-6 is the hexaphosphate ester of inositol. It is the major phosphorus storage compound in plants, comprising from 1-7% of the dry weight of most cereals, nuts, and legumes (1855, 1858). IP-6 is an inositol phosphate, a water-soluble form of inositol that is involved in cellular signaling. Other inositol phosphates that occur naturally in human and other cells include IP-7, IP-8, and IP-3. These differ from inositides, the lipid-soluble inositol compounds, which are also involved in signaling. Although IP-6 is found in all cells, it is found in mammalian cells in much smaller amounts than plant cells (1857, 97610).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using IP-6 for cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that the ability of IP-6 to chelate minerals might decrease iron-mediated colon cancer risk (1858). Laboratory research shows that IP-6 inhibits cancer cell proliferation and increases cancer cell differentiation, sometimes resulting in reversion to a normal phenotype (1859). IP-6 has demonstrated anticancer activity in models of breast, colon, liver, prostate, and hematological cancers in vitro (1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865, 13042). IP-6 is thought to potentially have antiangiogenic activity. In vitro, IP-6 inhibits experimentally induced angiogenesis (13041). In vitro, IP-6 has demonstrated a synergistic effect when used in combination with doxorubicin or tamoxifen for inhibiting growth of breast cancer cells (13256).\nAntioxidant effects\nIP-6 chelates minerals, including iron. This inhibits the ability of iron to catalyze hydroxyl radical formation. This activity plays a role in the effects of IP-6 in models of heart and lung injuries, inflammation, and ulcers (97608). As a natural antioxidant, IP-6 added to food reduces lipid peroxidation and retards spoilage (1855, 1858).\nCellular effects\nThe cellular functions of IP-6 include signal transduction and cellular proliferation and differentiation. In the cell, IP-6 is involved in ion channels, protein trafficking, exocytosis, endocytosis, DNA repair, and protein folding (1857, 97608, 97609, 97610). One of the main roles for IP-6 seems to be transporting mRNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm (97610).\nChemoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using IP-6 to reduce cyclophosphamide-induced testicular toxicities. Animal research in rats treated with cyclophosphamide shows that fortifying water with IP-6 2% for 2 weeks increases sperm count and motility and increases testicular testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels when compared with control. These effects are thought to be due to chelation and/or antioxidant activity, but this has not been well studied (106681).\nHypolipidemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that IP-6 lowers serum cholesterol and triglycerides, possibly by chelating minerals (1858, 1868).\nRenal effects\nIn the urine, IP-6 can reduce the formation of calcium and oxalate crystals (10297). IP-6 appears to reduce the concentration of calcium and the formation of calcium crystals in renal papillary tissue (10298)."

However, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Clinical Toxicologists, and European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists state that ipecac should not be used routinely for poisoning due to a lack of evidence of improved outcomes over available alternatives and an increased risk for adverse consequences (11349, 12394, 56389).\nResearch shows that inducing emesis with oral ipecac syrup within 10 minutes of poison ingestion can remove 28% to 54% of the poison dose from the patient (56408, 56419, 56455). However, as the interval between poison ingestion and ipecac-induced emesis is extended, the percentage of poison dose recovered declines, approaching zero after 90 minutes (56454, 56466). Furthermore, ipecac syrup does not appear to be more effective than activated charcoal (103744). While some research shows that taking 30 mL of ipecac syrup within one hour of poison ingestion can reduce absorption of poisons by about the same amount as taking 50-60 grams of activated charcoal (56411), most research shows that ipecac syrup is less effective than activated charcoal (56427, 56442, 56444). Also, using ipecac followed by activated charcoal after cessation of vomiting does not provide any benefit over earlier administration of activated charcoal alone (56403, 56451, 103744), and may increase patient recovery times (56392). Finally, there are also adverse consequences of ipecac use, including an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia and the need to delay administration of activated charcoal, poison-specific oral antidotes, or fluids for whole bowel irrigation after ipecac administration in order to avoid emesis of these treatments (12394, 56392, 56406, 56444, 103744).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of ipecac for its other uses.\nless",

A decrease in lymphocyte counts to less than 500/mcL seems to be most likely to occur after at least 6 months of treatment, although some patients develop lymphocytopenia after a longer duration of use (1196). Lymphocyte counts seem to normalize in most patients within 12 months after discontinuing ipriflavone (1196, 104208).\nless",

Most clinical research shows that ipriflavone can prevent loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal adults when taken in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily, with or without estrogen. It may also be beneficial in other patients, including oophorectomized adults and those with vitamin D deficiency.\nMost research in postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis shows that taking ipriflavone orally in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily can prevent loss of BMD or low bone mass (430, 432, 433, 2169, 2170, 2175, 104208), and may actually increase BMD in some patients (428, 2173, 2175, 4756, 104208). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research suggests that concomitant calcium must be used in doses of at least 1000 mg daily in order to obtain benefit. A subgroup analysis of four clinical studies utilizing calcium in doses of 500-800 mg daily found no effect on BMD (104208). Taking ipriflavone plus calcium or vitamin D prophylactically also seems to help prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal adults (2171, 2174, 104208). Ipriflavone can also significantly reduce osteoporotic pain and seems to be as effective as inhaled calcitonin (432, 2175, 4756, 4757). However, using ipriflavone in combination with low-dose estrogen seems to be more beneficial than ipriflavone alone for preventing osteoporosis. Ipriflavone plus conjugated estrogen 0.3 mg daily and calcium 500-1000 mg daily seems to consistently increase BMD in postmenopausal adults (427, 2171, 2172).\n\nIpriflavone has also been evaluated in other populations. In oophorectomized adults, taking ipriflavone in combination with conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg daily can decrease loss of BMD better than estrogen or ipriflavone alone (4749). Ipriflavone also seems to prevent loss of BMD induced by the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide (Lupron) (10228). Adding calcium provides further benefit (4746).\nless\nPaget disease. There is some evidence that ipriflavone 600 mg or 1200 mg given orally for 30 days can reduce bone pain, serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and hydroxyproline/creatinine excretion in patients with Paget disease (2176).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of ipriflavone for its other uses.\nless",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIpriflavone is a semisynthetic isoflavone manufactured in the laboratory from daidzein, a compound derived from soy (431).\nBone effects\nIpriflavone enhances osteoblast function and inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated bone resorption, mainly by inhibiting recruitment and maturation of osteoclasts, and enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblast cells (2173, 2176, 2179, 104208). Clinical research suggests that ipriflavone prevents bone density loss without suppressing the rate of bone formation (426). It does not appear to have direct estrogenic activity in postmenopausal adults, but might potentiate the effects of estrogen on bone, and stimulate estrogen-induced calcitonin secretion (434, 2179). Research in postmenopausal adults suggests that using ipriflavone in combination with conjugated estrogens for osteoporosis might allow for use of a lower estrogen dose (427, 2171, 2172). In patients with renal osteodystrophy, research shows that taking ipriflavone 400-600 mg daily increases calcitonin levels after one month (2177).\nCognitive effects\nIn a mouse model of diabetic cognitive impairment, ipriflavone functions as a nonsteroidal glucocorticoid receptor antagonist to improve short-term working memory and exploratory behavior. It also ameliorates dysfunctions of spatial working memory, spatial learning, and long-term memory (108753).\nImmunologic effects\nWhen added to blood from healthy individuals or those with peanut or milk allergies, ipriflavone suppresses basophil degranulation in response to an allergen stimulus. However, taking ipriflavone orally, 200 mg daily for 4 weeks in combination with genistein, does not affect basophil degranulation or skin prick test results in individuals with peanut or tree nut allergies (101219)."

    "Iron": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Iron is a trace mineral found in two ionic forms in the body. It exists in a reduced state as ferrous iron and in an oxidized state as ferric iron. Most of the iron in the body is found in the hemoglobin of red blood cells and in the myoglobin of muscle cells (1093). Iron is found in various foods, including beef, liver, lamb, pork, ham, chicken, fish, and beans (9540, 9541). Historically, iron has been used to treat various skin conditions, cystitis, diarrhea, edema, excessive lacrimation, fevers, gout, hemorrhoids, perianal fistulas, tuberculosis, and other disorders (56539).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. For people age 14 and older with adequate iron stores, iron supplements are safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 45 mg per day of elemental iron. The UL is not meant to apply to those who receive iron under medical supervision (7135, 96621). To treat iron deficiency, most people can safely take up to 300 mg elemental iron per day (15). ...when used intravenously and appropriately. Ferric carboxymaltose 200 mg and iron sucrose 200 mg have been given intravenously for up to 10 doses with no reported serious adverse effects (91179). A meta-analysis of clinical studies of hemodialysis patients shows that administering high-dose intravenous (IV) iron does not increase the risk of hospitalization, infection, cardiovascular events, or death when compared with low-dose IV iron, oral iron, or no iron treatment (102861). A more recent meta-analysis of clinical studies of all patient populations shows that administering IV iron does not increase the risk of hospital length of stay or mortality, although the risk of infection is increased by 16% when compared with oral iron or no iron (110186). Another meta-analysis of 3 large clinical trials in patients with heart failure shows that IV ferric carboxymaltose at a dose of around 1500 mg every 6 months for a year does not increase the incidence of adverse effects when compared with placebo (113901). Despite these findings, there are rare reports of hypophosphatemia and/or osteomalacia (112603, 112608, 112609, 112610, 113905).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Doses of 30 mg/kg are associated with acute toxicity. Long-term use of high doses of iron can cause hemosiderosis and multiple organ damage. The estimated lethal dose of iron is 180-300 mg/kg; however, doses as low as 60 mg/kg have also been lethal (15).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (7135, 91183, 112601).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Tell patients who are not iron-deficient not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg per day of elemental iron for infants and children aged 0-13 years and 45 mg per day for children aged 14-18 years. Higher doses frequently cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation and nausea (7135, 20097). Iron is the most common cause of pediatric poisoning deaths. Doses as low as 60 mg/kg can be fatal (15).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Iron is safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding in patients with adequate iron stores when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 45 mg daily of elemental iron (7135, 96625, 110180).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Tell patients who are not iron deficient to avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 45 mg daily of elemental iron. Higher doses frequently cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting (7135) and might increase the risk of preterm labor (100969). High hemoglobin concentrations at the time of delivery are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (7135, 20109).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally or intravenously, iron is generally well tolerated when used appropriately.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports have raised concerns about oral or gastric ulcerations.\n\nIntravenously: Case reports have raised concerns about hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.\nCardiovascular\nThere is debate regarding the association between coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) and high iron intake or high body iron stores. Some observational studies have reported that high body iron stores are associated with increased risk of MI and CHD (1492, 9542, 9544, 9545, 15175). Some observational studies reported that only high heme iron intake from dietary sources such as red meat are associated with increased risk of MI and CHD (1492, 9546, 15174, 15205, 15206, 91180). However, the majority of research has found no association between serum iron levels and cardiovascular disease (1097, 1099, 9543, 9547, 9548, 9549, 9550, 56469, 56683).\n\nThere is one case of Kounis syndrome, also referred to as allergic angina or allergic myocardial infarction, in a 39-year-old female patient without previous coronary artery disease given intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. The patient experienced anaphylactic symptoms, including headache, abdominal pain, and breathing difficulties, 3 minutes after starting the infusion. She was further diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (112607).\n\nThere is also a case of a 56-year-old female, negative for HFE mutation homozygosity, diagnosed with acquired iron overload cardiomyopathy after starting ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily 3 years prior for iron deficiency secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis with esophageal varices and encephalopathy. The patient had no follow-up care over the 3 years and denied any blood transfusions over that time (113906).\nless\nDermatologic\nCutaneous hemosiderosis, or skin staining, has been reported following intravenous (IV) iron infusion in various case reports. Most of these cases are due to extravasation following iron infusion (112605, 112611). In one case, extravasation has occurred following iron derisomaltose infusion in a 41-year-old female with chronic kidney disease (112605). Rarely, diffuse cutaneous hermosiderosis has occurred. In one case, a 31-year-old female with excessive sweating developed cutaneous hemosiderosis in the armpits following an (IV) iron polymaltose infusion (112611).\nless\nEndocrine\nPopulation research in females shows that higher ferritin levels are associated with an approximately 1.5-fold higher odds of developing gestational diabetes. Increased dietary intake of heme-iron, but not non-heme iron, is also associated with an increased risk for gestational diabetes. The effects of iron supplementation could not be determined from the evaluated research (96618). However, in a sub-analysis of a large clinical trial in pregnant adults, daily supplementation with iron 100 mg from 14 weeks gestation until delivery did not affect the frequency or severity of glucose intolerance or gestational weight gain (96619).\n\nIntravenous (IV) iron may trigger hypophosphatemia in some patients (113905). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with iron deficiency anemia shows that IV ferric carboxymaltose is associated with a higher risk of hypophosphatemia when compared with other IV formulations (i.e. iron dextran, iron isomaltoside, iron sucrose, and ferumoxytol) (115899). Severe hypophosphatemia requiring IV phosphate has also occurred following IV ferric carboxymaltose (112608, 112610).\n\nAdditionally, cases of osteomalacia related to hypophosphatemia subsequent to parenteral iron administration have been rarely reported (112603, 112609).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, iron can cause dry mouth, gastrointestinal irritation, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting (96621, 102864, 104680, 104684, 110179, 110185, 110188, 110189, 110192, 115894). These adverse effects are uncommon at doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 45 mg per day of elemental iron in adults with normal iron stores (7135). Higher doses can be taken safely in adults with iron deficiency, but gastrointestinal side effects may occur (1095, 20118, 20119, 56698, 102864). Taking iron supplements with food seems to reduce gastrointestinal side effects (7135). However, food can also significantly reduce iron absorption. Iron should be taken on an empty stomach, unless it cannot be tolerated.\n\nThere are several formulations of iron products such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and others. Manufacturers of some formulations, such as polysaccharide-iron complex products (Niferex-150, etc), claim to be better tolerated than other formulations; however, there is no reliable evidence to support this claim. Gastrointestinal tolerability relates mostly to the elemental iron dose rather than the formulation (17500).\n\nEnteric-coated or controlled-release iron formulations might reduce nausea for some patients, however, these products also have lower absorption rates (17500).\n\nLiquid oral preparations can blacken and stain teeth (20118).\n\nIron can also cause oral ulcerations and ulcerations of the gastric mucosa (56684, 91182, 96622, 110179). In one case report, an 87-year-old female with Alzheimer disease experienced a mucosal ulceration, possibly due to holding a crushed ferrous sulfate 80 mg tablet in the mouth for too long prior to swallowing (91182). The ulceration was resolved after discontinuing iron supplementation. In another case report, a 76-year old male suffered gastric mucosal injury after taking a ferrous sulfate tablet daily for 4 years (56684). In a third case report, a 14-year-old female developed gastritis involving symptoms of upper digestive hemorrhage, nausea, melena, and stomach pain. The hemorrhage was attributed to supplementation with ferrous sulfate 2 hours after meals for the prior 2 weeks (96622). In one case report, a 43-year old female developed atrophic gastritis with non-bleeding ulcerations five days after starting oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily (110179).\n\nIntravenously, iron can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea (104684, 110192, 115894).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, iron supplements have been associated with hemochromatosis. In one case report, a 56-year-old female, negative for HFE mutation homozygosity, was diagnosed with acquired hemochromatosis after starting ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily 3 years prior, without follow-up care, for a previous iron deficiency secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis with esophageal varices and encephalopathy (113906).\nless\nImmunologic\nAlthough there is some clinical research associating iron supplementation with an increased rate of malaria infection (56796, 95432), the strongest evidence to date does not support this association, at least for areas where antimalarial treatment is available (95433, 96623). In an analysis of 14 trials, iron supplementation was not associated with an increased risk of malaria (96623). In a sub-analysis of 7 preliminary clinical studies, the effect of iron supplementation was dependent upon the access to services for antimalarial treatment. In areas where anemia is common and services are available, iron supplementation is associated with a 9% reduced risk of clinical malaria. In an area where services are unavailable, iron supplementation was associated with a 16% increased risk in malaria incidence (96623). The difference in these findings is likely associated with the use of malaria prevention methods.\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies of all patient populations shows that administering intravenous (IV) iron, usually iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose, increases the risk of infection by 16% when compared with oral iron or no iron. However, sub-analyses suggest this increased risk is limited to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (110186). Additionally, a meta-analysis in adults with cancer-associated anemia shows that IV iron does not increase the risk of infection when compared with oral iron or no iron therapy (115892).\n\nIntravenously, iron has rarely resulted in allergic reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions (110185, 110192, 112606, 112607). There is one case of Kounis syndrome, also referred to as allergic angina or allergic myocardial infarction, in a 39-year-old female patient without previous coronary artery disease given IV ferric carboxymaltose. The patient experienced anaphylactic symptoms, including headache, abdominal pain, and breathing difficulties, 3 minutes after starting the infusion. She was further diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (112607).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIntravenous (IV) iron may trigger hypophosphatemia in some patients, and cases of osteomalacia related to hypophosphatemia subsequent to parenteral iron administration have been rarely reported (112609, 113905). In one case, a 70-year-old male with a genetic hemorrhagic disorder infused with ferric carboxymaltose developed lower limb pain with hypophosphatemia and diffuse bone demineralization in the feet (112609). In a second case, a 61-year-old male developed femoral neck insufficiency fractures following repeated ferric carboxymaltose transfusions for anemia related to vascular malformation in the bowel (112603).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is a debate regarding the association between high levels of iron stores and cancer. Data are conflicting and inconclusive (1098, 1099, 1100, 1102). Epidemiological studies suggest that increased body iron stores may increase the risk of cancer or general mortality (56703).\n\nOccupational exposure to iron may be carcinogenic (56691). Oral exposure to iron may also be carcinogenic. Pooled analyses of population studies suggest that increasing the intake of heme iron increases the risk of colorectal cancer. For example, increasing heme iron intake by 1 mg/day is associated with an 11% increase in risk (56699, 91185).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, iron has been associated with rare reports of iron pill aspiration. This occurs when all or part of the pill is aspirated into the lungs. Once in the lungs, it can cause a chemical burn of the bronchial mucosa. Dozens of cases of iron pill aspiration have been reported in individuals ranging in age from 22 months to 92 years. Patients presented with cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and hemoptysis. The hemoptysis led to death in 2 patients due to hemorrhage. Long-term complication of fibrosis and bronchial stenosis was reported in a few of the cases. In one case, a 48-year-old female accidentally aspirated a ferrous sulfate tablet and presented to the emergency department with cough, blood-stained sputum, chest pain, dyspnea, and acute distress. Bronchoscopy was performed, parts of the pill were retrieved, and chemical burns and necrotic tissue were observed in the bronchus intermedius mucosa and throughout the middle and lower lobes. Debridement with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, placed on mechanical ventilation for 2 days, treated with corticosteroids, and discharged on the fifth day of hospitalization. Four weeks post-discharge the patient had significantly improved but still had some reduction in lung capacity.\nless\nOther\nIntravenously, sodium ferric gluconate complex (SFGC) caused drug intolerance reactions in 0.4% of hemodialysis patients including 2 patients with pruritus and one patient each with anaphylactoid reaction, hypotension, chills, back pain, dyspnea/chest pain, facial flushing, rash and cutaneous symptoms of porphyria (56527).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nAnemia of chronic disease. Oral and intravenous (IV) iron in combination with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are effective for treating anemia of chronic disease.\nIron supplementation with ESAs is effective for treating anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or chemotherapy. During therapy with ESAs, iron levels should be monitored and supplementation provided as needed to ensure that the response is not limited by lack of iron for erythropoiesis (1087, 1091, 20110, 20111, 110192). Research shows that IV iron appears to be more effective than oral supplements for this purpose (20112, 20113). In patients with CKD, IV iron at total doses from 2232 mg over 6 months to 1020 mg over one week increases hemoglobin levels more than oral doses of 4-6 mg/kg daily or 325 mg daily for up to 6 months (20112).\n\nSome research has evaluated the effect of IV or oral iron in patients not treated with ESAs. In patients with cancer or CKD, oral iron supplements have been shown to improve iron status (110184, 110192). However, overall benefits of iron alone remain unclear in treated or untreated patients with cancer and more research is needed to rule out an increase in mortality and to determine any effect on blood transfusion requirements (110192).\n\nPreliminary clinical research shows that children aged 6 months to 10 years with HIV and anemia who take elemental iron 3 mg/kg daily along with a multivitamin for 3 months have a 41% lower chance of having persistent anemia at 3 months when compared with multivitamins alone (95432).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. Oral and intravenous (IV) iron are effective for treating or preventing iron deficiency anemia. The benefits of iron supplementation in people with iron deficiency without anemia are unclear.\nOral iron supplements, mainly as ferrous sulfate, are effective for treating and preventing iron deficiency anemia in adults, children, and infants (1089, 7135, 17495, 17496, 17497, 103806, 20114, 20115, 91183, 96621)(104680, 104681, 112601). Other forms are also effective, including sodium iron ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (NaFeEDTA), iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC), iron protein succinylate, iron bisglycinate, and lactoferrin with iron (20117, 20118, 110189). Treatment with iron supplements should increase hemoglobin levels by 1 gram/dL every 2-3 weeks. However, even after hemoglobin has normalized, it may take up to 4 months for iron stores to be replenished (17497).\n\nHistorically, treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron supplements has typically consisted of a daily dosing regimen, often taken in divided doses to reduce adverse effects. In more recent years, however, intermittent iron supplementation (1-3 doses/week) has become preferred for some patients, particularly those with mild anemia, due to better absorption and a possible reduction in side effects compared to daily dosing. One small clinical study shows that taking ferrous sulfate 60 mg on alternate days in single doses improves iron absorption when compared to once daily dosing (96630). Another small clinical study in females with iron-deficiency anemia shows that fractional iron absorption is 40% to 50% higher with alternate-day dosing compared with daily dosing. Furthermore, total iron absorption was shown to be similar for alternate day dosing of elemental iron 200 mg compared with daily dosing of 100 mg, but the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects may be lower for the alternate day dosing regimen (101514). A meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials, including 10,996 menstruating females with or without pre-existing iron deficiency and/or anemia, shows that intermittent iron reduces the risk of anemia and increases hemoglobin and serum ferritin when compared with placebo or no intervention. This meta-analysis did not identify differences in the risk of anemia, hemoglobin, or serum ferritin between intermittent and daily iron supplementation. However, it did show that females receiving intermittent dosing had a 59% reduction in the risk for adverse effects. The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity in the enrolled populations and selected dosing strategies, including frequency of intermittent dosing, total weekly dose, and duration of follow-up. In addition, the subgroup analyses performed by baseline anemia, hemoglobin, and serum ferritin, as well as duration of follow-up, showed differing overall conclusions when comparing intermittent and daily iron supplementation. While intermittent dosing appears to be beneficial when compared with daily dosing for some patients with iron deficiency anemia, intermittent dosing may be less effective than daily iron supplementation in some patients (103806). For patients with severe anemia, twice daily dosing may be preferred to alternate day dosing due to faster response. A small clinical study in patients with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking ferrous sulfate 200 mg twice daily is more effective at increasing hemoglobin levels by 3 weeks when compared with ferrous sulfate 400 mg taken on alternate days in single doses (102864).\n\nIntermittent iron supplementation has also been investigated in children. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children and adolescents with or without pre-existing iron deficiency and/or anemia shows that taking iron supplements 1-2 times weekly is similarly effective as 3-7 times weekly for decreasing iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. However, ferritin and hemoglobin levels increased to a greater extent with 3-7 times weekly supplementation (112601).\n\nBlood transfusion may be required for some patients with severe iron deficiency anemia who have symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue (17497). Intravenous iron should be considered in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or in patients with chronic bleeding or intestinal malabsorption (17497).\n\nGuidance from the American Gastroenterological Association and the British Society of Gastroenterology recommends treatment with iron while awaiting investigations to rule out gastrointestinal issues in adults in the absence of an alternative explanation. Ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate daily are recommended. If adverse effects occur, intake can be reduced to once every other day, or alternative oral or parenteral sources of iron can be used. Parenteral sources should be used if oral sources are contraindicated or ineffective. Treatment should be monitored and continued after hemoglobin levels have normalized (110193, 115890).\n\nIron supplementation may also be beneficial in patients with iron deficiency without anemia, which can cause fatigue and reduced well-being, although guidelines are lacking. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with iron deficiency but not anemia shows that supplemental iron improves iron stores and hemoglobin levels. In addition, iron moderately reduces self-reported fatigue, but not physical capacity, when compared with placebo. Oral ferrous sulfate was used in most studies included in the analysis; however, IV or intramuscular iron were also used (104684).\n\nIntravenous iron has also been evaluated for the prevention of postoperative anemia. A meta-analysis of several, moderate-quality clinical studies in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, including patients with or without anemia, shows that various types of IV iron (e.g. ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose) reduce the risk of red blood cell transfusions by approximately 23%, and improve hemoglobin and iron levels by postoperative day 4, when compared with placebo and oral iron therapy (115898). The validity of these results is limited by heterogeneous methods across clinical studies including patient population, iron formulation, and use of erythropoietin.\nless\nPregnancy-related iron deficiency. Oral and intravenous (IV) iron are effective for managing pregnancy-related iron deficiency.\nClinical research shows that taking iron orally at an average daily dose of 15-225 mg of elemental iron increases maternal hemoglobin levels by up to 1 gram/dL when compared with placebo and reduces the risk of maternal anemia by 50% to 100% (20122, 20123, 20124, 110180, 110188, 115895). Some clinicians may recommend alternating days of iron administration to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects. A pooled analysis shows that taking iron supplements, with or without folic acid, on alternating days during pregnancy maintains adequate iron intake and reduces gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with taking iron daily (96625). Another meta-analysis shows that daily supplementation of iron with folic acid increases hemoglobin levels by 0.24 g/dL when compared with intermittent supplementation, given as 1, 2, or 3 doses weekly. However, clinical significance of this slight increase is unlikely, and no difference in rates of anemia are noted between dosing strategies (115896).\n\nVarious forms of oral iron seem to be equally effective for raising hemoglobin levels (110185, 110188, 115895). However, in patients with anemia during pregnancy, meta-analyses of several, moderate-quality clinical studies show that IV iron (e.g. iron sucrose) is more effective than oral iron (e.g. ferrous sulfate) for improving hemoglobin levels and reducing the risk for anemia (110185, 115897).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBreath-holding attacks. Oral iron seems to be effective for reducing the frequency of breath-holding attacks in children with iron deficiency.\nThe incidence of breath-holding attacks is increased in children with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Most research shows that oral supplementation with ferrous sulfate 3-6 mg/kg daily for 4-16 weeks reduces the frequency of breath-holding attacks in children aged 1-72 months (20128, 104682, 104683). The best evidence comes from a meta-analysis of one randomized controlled trial and 11 observational single arm studies (104682). In this analysis, approximately 84% of children experienced at least a 50% decreased frequency of breath-holding attacks (104682). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that administering intramuscular iron reduces the frequency of breath-holding attacks and increases remission in children with iron deficiency anemia (20128).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral iron seems to be effective for improving cognitive function in children and adolescents with iron deficiency.\nTaking iron orally seems to improve cognitive function in iron-deficient children and adolescents (20121, 112600). For example, ferrous sulfate 650 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improved verbal learning and memory in non-anemic iron-deficient adolescent females (1095). Ferrous sulfate 50 mg twice weekly for 16 weeks appeared to improve attention measures in adolescent females with possible anemia (91186). Iron also appears to reverse developmental and learning deficits caused by iron-deficiency in anemic infants (1104).\n\nSome clinical research is focused on children and adolescents from low- and middle-income countries. In children aged 5-19 years with or without iron-deficiency anemia, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that iron supplementation for 3-8 months dose-dependently improves measured intelligence by a modest amount. However, there was no effect on other measures of cognition, including attention or memory (110181). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in school age children shows that taking iron for 2-12 months modestly improves intelligence, attention, and memory, but not educational achievement, when compared with placebo or no intervention. However, sub-analyses show that any benefits are limited to children with anemia (112600). Most studies included in the analyses evaluated daily iron supplementation, with a few studies assessing iron taken 4-6 times weekly (110181, 112600). In contrast, a large clinical trial in schoolchildren in Ethiopia shows that taking iron supplements, providing 42 mg of elemental iron, once weekly for 11 months does not improve working memory, nonverbal intelligence, planning, or problem-solving, and may even worsen one measure of attention and concentration when compared with placebo (113904). These discrepant findings may be related to differences in frequency of dosing (daily vs. weekly) and baseline demographics; only 20% and 4% of children in this study had iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, respectively.\nless\nHeart failure. Intravenous (IV) iron seems to be effective for improving certain outcomes in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency. It is unclear if oral iron is effective.\nIron deficiency is common in patients with heart failure (17499, 112597, 112598, 112599). A number of large clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with heart failure show that administering IV iron, as ferric carboxymaltose, iron dextran, iron isomaltoside, or iron sucrose, for at least 12 weeks modestly improves quality of life, increases exercise capacity, and reduces hospitalizations when compared with placebo or standard care. However, there was no effect on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality (17498, 91179, 110176, 110187, 112597, 112598, 112599, 113900, 113901). Based on these results, guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology support the use of IV iron in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency to improve symptoms and quality of life. Additionally, IV iron supplementation in these patients is associated with a reduced risk of heart failure hospitalization (115935, 115936).\n\nLimited research has investigated the effect of oral iron in this population. A small meta-analysis of clinical research shows with low certainty that taking iron orally has beneficial effects on serum ferritin and left ventricular ejection fraction (110178). Most research shows that taking oral iron does not improve hemoglobin levels, quality of life, or exercise capacity when compared with placebo (100970, 110178). However, one small clinical trial shows that taking oral iron modestly improves iron status and overall symptoms and increases the 6-minute walking distance by about 46 meters, compared with a reduction of only 14 meters in those taking placebo (110183). Some doses used in individual clinical studies have included iron polysaccharide 150 mg twice daily for 16 weeks and ferrous sulfate 200 mg three times daily for 12 weeks (100970, 110183).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). Oral and intravenous (IV) iron seem to be beneficial for RLS. The American Academy of Neurology recommends a combination of oral ferrous sulfate and vitamin C or IV ferric carboxymaltose for patients with RLS.\nRLS is commonly associated with iron deficiency anemia. Some clinical research shows that taking iron in the form of ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces RLS symptoms comparably to pramipexole. Symptoms such as leg discomfort, need to move, and sleep disturbances improved considerably in about half of the patients taking either treatment (91181). Additional clinical research shows that taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily along with vitamin C 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces symptoms of RLS when compared with vitamin C alone in patients with RLS and low-normal serum ferritin levels (94189). Based on these results, clinical practice guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology report that taking this combination of oral ferrous sulfate and vitamin C is likely to improve symptoms in patients with RLS and low-normal serum ferritin (93587).\n\nIntravenous iron may also reduce symptoms of RLS. Clinical practice guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology report that two doses of IV ferric carboxymaltose 500 mg given 5 days apart are likely to improve symptoms and quality of life within 28 days in patients with moderate to severe RLS, regardless of serum ferritin levels. Iron sucrose, given IV, has also been evaluated in patients with RLS, but there is currently insufficient available evidence to support or refute the use of this form of iron for treating RLS (93587).\n\nAdditionally, IV and oral iron have been compared in the management of RLS. A clinical study in adults with RLS and iron deficiency anemia shows that administering IV ferumoxytol 1020 mg for 2 doses, 2-7 days apart, reduces self-reported symptom severity and frequency comparably to taking oral ferrous sulfate 650 mg daily for 6 weeks (115894). The validity of these results is limited by methodological concerns, including lack of a placebo control group and failure to obtain all follow-up data.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral iron does not seem to improve athletic performance.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults of childbearing age shows that iron supplementation improves some exercise performance measures, such as maximal oxygen uptake capacity, but not others, such as time until exhaustion and energy consumption, when compared with control (91184). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with iron deficiency without anemia shows that iron supplementation improves subjective measures of fatigue, but does not improve exercise time to exhaustion or other measures of physical capacity (104684). A small clinical study in healthy children shows that taking iron supplements or consuming food providing iron 30-200 mg daily for 1-2 months improves running performance when compared with placebo. This was demonstrated by reductions of heart rate of 6.6 to 8 beats per minute during the running exercise. One preliminary study included in this analysis also showed that iron supplementation improved treadmill endurance time (20140).\nless\nChild growth. Oral iron does not seem to be beneficial for child growth.\nMeta-analyses of mainly preliminary clinical research show that oral iron supplementation, at doses averaging 2-80 mg or 1-10 mg/kg elemental iron daily for up to 52 weeks, does not increase growth rate in children (20131, 20132, 20133, 95434).\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral iron does not seem to prevent preterm labor and may actually increase the risk in malaria-endemic regions.\nA meta-analysis of results from five clinical studies shows that maternal intake of iron as ferrous sulfate 20-60 mg daily for 14-26 weeks starting in the second trimester of pregnancy does not affect the length of gestation or increase birthweight of the infant (95434). In females from a malaria-endemic area who have never been pregnant before, another clinical study shows that taking ferrous gluconate 60 mg and folic acid 2.8 mg weekly, starting before conception and continuing to the first antenatal visit, may more than double the risk of preterm birth, defined as a delivery under 37 weeks gestation, when compared with folic acid alone (100969). Some research suggests that the adverse outcome in this latter study may be explained by a rise in hepcidin levels in pregnant patients with malaria. Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron absorption and distribution, and malaria can upregulate hepcidin. High levels of hepcidin can decrease iron absorption, stimulate inflammatory processes, and cause progesterone withdrawal, leading to preterm labor (102863).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nACE inhibitor-induced cough. It is unclear if oral iron is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking ferrous sulfate 256 mg daily reduces or eliminates cough induced by ACE inhibitors such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), and others, when compared with placebo (7307).\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. Oral iron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking one tablet daily of a specific product (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs), providing an unknown dose of iron in combination with selenium, taurine, cysteine, methionine, and hydrolyzed collagen, along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, for 12 weeks improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone (111636). It is unclear if this effect is due to iron, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral iron is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nA meta-analysis of three small, lower quality clinical studies in children and adolescents with ADHD and iron deficiency shows that taking ferrous fumarate 200-400 mg, dependent upon body weight, or ferrous sulfate 80 mg daily for 3 months does not improve hyperactivity and inattention when compared with placebo. However, the results of individual clinical studies are inconsistent (115893). The validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity across clinical studies, including patient baseline characteristics, use of investigator-, parent-, and teacher-rated ADHD scales, and concomitant use of ADHD medication therapy (e.g. stimulants).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral iron is beneficial for improving development in non-anemic children.\nSome observational research has found that iron deficiency in infancy is associated with poor verbal performance and social skills in childhood (102862). It is unknown whether iron supplementation can ameliorate these developmental issues. In non-anemic infants and children, clinical research shows that iron does not improve cognitive performance; the evidence for the benefits of iron on psychomotor development is conflicting (20129, 20130, 91315, 96616, 96626, 115891).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral iron is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that taking iron supplements is associated with a 32% lower risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma when compared to never taking iron supplements. However, use of iron supplements is not associated with a lower risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (95435).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral iron is beneficial in patients with fatigue due to iron deficiency without anemia.\nA meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research in adults with iron deficiency without anemia shows that iron reduces self-reported fatigue moderately more than placebo (104684). A specific ferrous sulfate supplement (Tardyferon; Pierre Fabre Médicament) providing 80 mg of elemental iron daily for 4-12 weeks was used in two studies included in this analysis (11406, 91188).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In patients with active IBD, intravenous iron may be more beneficial than oral iron due to impaired absorption. However, it may also increase the risk of infection in these patients.\nSince the absorption of oral iron may be impaired in patients with active symptoms of IBD, guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology suggest that treatment with parenteral iron may be needed in patients with IBD who have moderate to severe iron-deficiency anemia (110193). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research in this population shows that administering IV iron, usually as iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose, increases the risk of infection by 73% when compared with oral iron or no iron (110186).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if intravenous (IV) iron is beneficial for recovery following cardiac surgery.\nA meta-analysis of low- to moderate-quality clinical research in patients with preoperative iron-deficiency anemia shows that treatment with IV iron before cardiac surgery does not improve the rate of transfusions or the length of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital when compared with control groups, including placebo, oral iron, or no treatment. Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that IV iron does not reduce postoperative mortality rates (110182).\nless\nPostpartum depression. Although there has been interest in using iron for postpartum depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of iron for this condition.\nPrematurity. Enteral iron seems to be beneficial for some measures of development in preterm infants.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in preterm or low birthweight infants fed human milk shows that enteral iron supplementation increases linear growth and reduces the risk of anemia when compared with control groups receiving no iron supplementation. However, there was no effect on serum ferritin, weight, head circumference, cognitive development, risk of infection, or risk of necrotising enterocolitis (110177). Additional clinical research in infants born at 24-28 weeks' gestation shows that a higher average enteral iron dose by 60 days of age is positively associated with cognitive performance at 2 years of corrected age. However, this association was not present for iron doses received at 90 days of age (110190).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate iron for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: For adults, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 8 mg/day for males ages 19 and older, and females ages 51 and older. For females 19 to 50 years, the RDA is 18 mg/day. During pregnancy, the RDA is 27 mg/day. During lactation, the RDA is 10 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years, and 9 mg/day for ages 19 to 50 (7135).\n\nPatients should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level of 45 mg iron daily unless advised by a healthcare provider. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nDietary or supplemental calcium may decrease the absorption of dietary or supplemental iron. However, in people with adequate stores of these minerals, this does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on long-term iron status (8875).\n\nAdvise patients that iron should be taken on an empty stomach if possible. Taking iron supplements with food can decrease iron absorption by 40% to 75% (17500, 110193). This is likely due to binding of iron in the gut by calcium, polyphenols, tannins, and other dietary constituents (8875, 8887, 9570, 9571, 9573, 17497, 17500). If iron must be taken with food to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects, advise patients to avoid taking iron at the same time as dairy, coffee, tea, or cereals (7135, 17497, 17500).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The adequate intake (AI) of iron for infants 6 months of age and less is 0.27 mg/day (7135). For older infants and children, the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for iron are: 7-12 months, 11 mg/day; 1-3 years, 7 mg/day; 4-8 years, 10 mg/day; 9-13 years, 8 mg/day; males 14-18 years, 11 mg/day; females 14-18 years, 15 mg/day.\n\nFor preventing iron deficiency in children, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend iron supplements for some groups. For breast-fed infants, elemental iron 1 mg/kg/day is recommended from ages 4-6 months. Infants from 6-12 months should get 11 mg/day from food or supplements. For pre-term infants, 2 mg/kg/day for the first year is recommended. This should be continued until the baby is switched to formula or otherwise getting enough iron from food sources. Formula-fed children get enough iron from infant formula. Toddlers aged 1-3 years usually get enough iron from foods; however, a supplement can be added as needed (17495, 17496). Plain iron drops (Fer-In-Sol, Fer-Gen-Sol, etc) are usually preferred for children (17495).\n\nPatients should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level of 40 mg iron daily for children aged 0-13 years and of 45 mg iron daily for children aged 14-18 years unless advised by a healthcare provider. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThere are several formulations and salt forms of iron which contain different amounts of elemental iron:\n\n1 gram of ferrous gluconate = 120 mg elemental iron (12% iron)\n\n1 gram of ferrous sulfate = 200 mg elemental iron (20% iron)\n\n1 gram of ferrous fumarate = 330 mg elemental iron (33% iron)\n\n\nEfficacy and tolerability are similar for these different forms when used in equal doses of elemental iron. Manufacturers of some formulations such as polysaccharide-iron complex products (Niferex-150, etc) claim to be better tolerated than other formulations. However, there is no reliable evidence to support this claim. Enteric coated or controlled release iron formulations might reduce nausea for some patients; however, these products also have lower absorption rates (17500). Heme-iron polypeptide products (Proferrin ES, etc) are derived from the hemoglobin of animals and have better absorption compared to inorganic iron salts (17500). Carbonyl iron (Feosol with Carbonyl Iron, Iron Chews, etc) contains microparticles of 100% purified elemental iron. It is slowly absorbed which allows for controlled release over 1-2 days. It is not more effective than other forms, but is less toxic in cases of accidental ingestion (17500).\n\nOther forms include sodium iron ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (NaFeEDTA), iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC), and iron proteinsuccinylate (20117, 20118).",

Serum parathyroid hormone was also elevated (348 pg/mL). Subsequent iron infusions with iron polymaltose and ferric carboxymaltose were followed by transient hypophosphatemia, but without hypocalcemia. Additionally, a literature review describes 6 additional cases of hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia in patients 52-92 years of age who had been administered intravenous iron as either ferric carboxymaltose or iron polymaltose and subcutaneous denosumab within 1-4 weeks of each other (113905).\nless\nDOLUTEGRAVIR (Tivicay)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nIron might decrease dolutegravir levels by reducing its absorption.\nAdvise patients to take dolutegravir at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking iron. Pharmacokinetic research shows that iron can decrease the absorption of dolutegravir from the gastrointestinal tract through chelation (93578). When taken under fasting conditions, a single dose of ferrous fumarate 324 mg orally along with dolutegravir 50 mg reduces overall exposure to dolutegravir by 54% (94190).\nless\nINTEGRASE INHIBITORS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, taking iron along with integrase inhibitors might decrease the levels and clinical effects of these drugs.\nIron is a divalent cation. There is concern that iron may decrease the absorption of integrase inhibitors from the gastrointestinal tract through chelation (93578). One pharmacokinetic study shows that iron can decrease blood levels of the specific integrase inhibitor dolutegravir through chelation (94190). Also, other pharmacokinetic research shows that other divalent cations such as calcium can decrease the absorption and levels of some integrase inhibitors through chelation (93578, 93579).\nless\nLEVODOPA\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nIron might decrease levodopa levels by reducing its absorption.\nAdvise patients to separate doses of levodopa and iron as much as possible.

It has been suggested that a decrease of absorption is possible, probably by forming nonabsorbable chelates. However, mycophenolate pharmacokinetics are not affected by iron supplementation in available clinical research (3046, 20152, 20153, 20154, 20155).\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nIron might decrease penicillamine levels by reducing its absorption.\nAdvise patients to separate penicillamine and iron doses by at least 2 hours. Oral iron supplements can reduce absorption of penicillamine by 30% to 70%, probably due to chelate formation. In people with Wilson's disease, this interaction has led to reduced efficacy of penicillamine (3046, 3072, 20156).\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nIron might decrease levels of quinolone antibiotics by reducing their absorption.\nAdvise patients to separate quinolone antibiotics and iron doses by at least 2 hours.

However, a significant interaction has not been shown in humans.\nless\nBETA-CAROTENE\nTaking iron with beta-carotene might enhance dietary non-heme iron absorption and in people with anemia and Vitamin A deficiency.\nVitamin A appears to be involved in mobilizing iron from tissue stores for delivery to immature red blood cells in the bone marrow. Improvements in hemoglobin levels can occur in people with anemia and low serum retinol levels when they are given vitamin A supplements (9586). Vitamin A may also be involved in the differentiation and proliferation of blood stem cells in the bone marrow, and in the synthesis of erythropoietin (9518). Preliminary evidence also suggests that vitamin A and beta-carotene may enhance non-heme iron absorption from iron-fortified wheat and corn flour, and rice. It's suggested that these vitamins bind to iron in the gut, improving its solubility and preventing binding by dietary polyphenols and phytate, which reduce iron absorption (9569). It's unlikely that vitamin A supplements would have significant effects on iron status in people without vitamin A deficiency.\nless\nCALCIUM\nCalcium can decrease iron absorption.\nCalcium inhibits the absorption of dietary heme- and non-heme iron (7135, 7308, 9573). However, in people with adequate iron stores, this doesn't appear to be clinically significant (1848, 1849, 1850, 7135, 7308). Advise people at risk for iron deficiency to take calcium supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting dietary iron absorption (7308). Calcium supplements can also inhibit absorption of iron supplements. However, the effect is variable and depends on the salt form used, presence or absence of food, and the type of food (9586). Clinical research in young females who are fasting suggests that calcium citrate decreases iron absorption from a ferrous sulfate supplement more than other calcium salts, such as chloride, gluconate, carbonate, lactate, sulfate, or phosphate (99425). The clinical significance is unclear, but advise patients to take calcium and iron supplements at different times of the day if possible.\nless\nCASEIN PROTEIN\nCasein protein, but not hydrolyzed casein protein (casein peptides), seems to decrease iron absorption.\nClinical research shows that consuming casein protein 30 grams leads to a 45% reduction in iron absorption when compared with consuming egg-white derived protein. However, this interaction does not appear to occur with hydrolyzed casein protein (casein peptides) (91634).\nless\nLACTOBACILLUS\nTheoretically, taking iron with lactobacillus might increase the absorption of iron.\nSome clinical research shows that a fruit drink containing iron and 1 billion colony forming units of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v increases the absorption of iron by about 9% when compared with a control fruit drink (96617). The clinical significance of this effect is unclear.\nless\nSOY\nSoy protein seems to decrease iron absorption.\nSoy protein reduces absorption of dietary non-heme (plant-derived) iron, probably due to binding of iron by phytate and calcium present in soy (5053, 9573). Fermented soy products seem to inhibit iron absorption less than non-fermented products (9586). The clinical significance of these effects hasn't been determined.\nless\nVITAMIN A\nTaking iron with vitamin A might enhance dietary non-heme iron absorption in people with anemia and Vitamin A deficiency.\nVitamin A appears to be involved in mobilizing iron from tissue stores for delivery to immature red blood cells in the bone marrow. Improvements in hemoglobin levels can occur in people with anemia and low serum retinol levels when they are given vitamin A supplements (9586, 20124, 20147). Vitamin A may also be involved in the differentiation and proliferation of blood stem cells in the bone marrow, and in the synthesis of erythropoietin (9518). Preliminary evidence also suggests that vitamin A and beta-carotene may enhance non-heme iron absorption from iron-fortified wheat and corn flour, and rice. It's suggested that these vitamins bind to iron in the gut, improving its solubility and preventing binding by dietary polyphenols and phytate, which reduce iron absorption (9569, 20149). It's unlikely that vitamin A supplements would have significant effects on iron status in people without vitamin A deficiency.\nless\nVITAMIN C\nWhen ingested at the same time, supplemental or dietary vitamin C improves absorption of dietary non-heme iron. Its effect on iron supplements is unclear.\nDietary vitamin C promotes the absorption of non-heme iron (iron not bound to the heme group of blood or muscle proteins) by promoting its conversion to the ferrous state (9518, 9571, 9586). The amount of vitamin C in the diet is a factor in dietary iron absorption and iron status (9570, 9572). Vitamin C can counteract the effects of substances which inhibit iron absorption such as dietary phytates, polyphenols, and tannins possibly by chemically reducing iron and preventing the formation of less soluble ferric compounds (9518, 9573, 9586). It is unclear if taking vitamin C improves the absorption of supplemental non-heme iron and may depend on the specific form of the supplement. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin C with a ferrous succinate supplement does not seem to improve iron status more rapidly than taking the iron supplement without vitamin C (104680). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking iron with vitamin C does not improve hemoglobin or serum ferritin levels when compared with iron alone (112477). Taking a vitamin C supplement to improve absorption of dietary or supplemental iron probably isn't necessary for most people, especially if their diet contains plenty of vitamin C (9571). Also, some clinical research shows that taking copper in combination with iron and ascorbic acid negates the absorption enhancing effects of vitamin C (96624).\nless\nYERBA MATE\nTheoretically, concomitant use of iron and yerba mate may reduce the effectiveness of iron supplementation.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis shows that drinking yerba mate tea with iron-containing meals attenuates increases in serum iron levels. Some researchers have suggested that polyphenolic constituents of yerba mate, such as chlorogenic acid, bind to gastrointestinal iron and reduce oral iron absorption (107230).\nless\nZINC\nIron and zinc can interfere with each other's absorption when taken on an empty stomach.\nWhen high supplemental doses of zinc are taken on an empty stomach there is a measurable reduction in iron absorption, and high supplemental doses of non-heme iron taken on an empty stomach can reduce zinc absorption, especially when dietary mineral intake is low (8856, 9579, 9580, 9581, 9582, 9583, 9584). This is probably because the carriers for iron and zinc in the gut become saturated at high doses, and the ions then compete for non-specific carriers. If one of the ions is present in excess, absorption of the other will be decreased (9580). When food is present, the ions become complexed with food components and don't compete for absorption (9579). Therefore, there isn't a significant interaction between dietary iron and zinc, or between supplemental iron and zinc, when taken with food (8866, 9579, 9581). Advise patients to take these supplements with food.\nless",

Females with type 2 diabetes who have the highest intake of heme iron from dietary sources such as red meat have a 50% greater risk of coronary heart disease when compared with those with the lowest intake. This risk also appears to be higher in patients with type 2 diabetes who are postmenopausal as opposed to premenopausal (15174). Other studies have linked high iron body stores to increased risk of heart disease in people who do not have diabetes (1492, 9542, 9544, 9545, 15205, 15206), but the majority of studies have found no association (1097, 1099, 9543, 9547, 9548, 9549, 9550). Some researchers speculate that patients with diabetes might be more prone to adverse effects of iron. The metabolic abnormalities that occur in people with diabetes, such as dyslipidemia, might increase the adverse cardiovascular effects of iron (9545, 15174, 15175).\nless\nHEMODIALYSIS\nSupplemental iron absorption is decreased in people requiring chronic hemodialysis (1088, 1090).\nless\nHEMOGLOBIN DISEASES\nIron overload is likely to occur in people with hemoglobinopathies or other refractory anemias erroneously diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia (15).\nless\nHEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA (HHT)\nIron supplementation is associated with an increased risk of nosebleed in patients with HTT (96629); use with caution.\nless\nPHYSICAL TRAINING\nSupplemental iron absorption appears to be decreased in young females participating in physical training, as measured by serum ferritin levels (96627).\nless\nPREMATURE INFANTS\nCorrect vitamin E deficiency before administering supplemental iron to premature infants (15). Use of oral iron preparations in premature infants with low serum vitamin E levels may cause hemolysis and hemolytic anemia (15).\nless\nTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY\nIntravenous iron may increase the risk of cerebral edema in patients with traumatic brain injury. In a case report, a 46-year-old female hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury was given intravenous iron sucrose for anemia. She developed worsening edema with a decline in neurological status (112602).\nless",

Advise patients to consult their physician if these symptoms occur. For information on foods that are rich in iron, see our chart.\nless\nANTACIDS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nAntacids might modestly reduce iron absorption.\nGastric acid is important for absorption of dietary, non-heme iron (4539). Antacids may therefore reduce iron absorption by increasing gastric pH and reducing iron solubility (3072). This isn't likely to be clinically significant in most people with adequate dietary iron intake. However, antacids can reduce absorption of iron from supplements by 30% to 40%, and reduced efficacy has occurred occasionally (3046). Advise patients who need iron supplements to avoid antacids or separate the doses as much as possible.\nless\nCHOLESTYRAMINE (Questran)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCholestyramine might modestly reduce iron absorption and reduce iron levels.\nCholestyramine and colestipol may bind iron in the gut, reducing its absorption (9566). Clinically significant iron deficiency induced by these drugs hasn't been reported, and supplements aren't likely to be needed. If patients are taking iron supplements for other causes of deficiency, recommend they separate the iron and cholestyramine or colestipol doses by at least four hours.\nless\nH2-BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nH2-blockers might modestly reduce iron absorption.\nGastric acid is important for the absorption of iron, particularly dietary non-heme iron (4539). Dose-dependent reductions in dietary iron absorption have been noted with cimetidine, ranging from 28% to 65% with single doses of 300-900 mg (8876). However, long-term treatment, up to 18 years, with H2-blockers isn't associated with iron depletion or anemia in people with normal iron stores (4483, 4539, 9578). Advise people to maintain adequate dietary iron intake. Supplements aren't necessary unless people have other factors contributing to iron deficiency. For information on foods that are rich in iron, see our chart.\nless\nPANCREATIC ENZYMES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPancreatic enzymes reduce iron absorption and might decrease iron levels.\nThere is some evidence that pancreatic enzyme supplements can reduce iron absorption, possibly by binding iron or altering pH (9575, 9585). It's unlikely that this will be clinically significant, except in people with cystic fibrosis who need pancreatic enzyme supplements for prolonged periods, and have other factors contributing to iron deficiency (9575). Advise these patients to have their iron status checked regularly. For information on foods that are rich in iron, see our chart.\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nPenicillamine might modestly reduce iron absorption and reduce iron levels.\nPenicillamine chelates iron in the gastrointestinal tract and decreases absorption. If iron supplements are used, separate from penicillamine by at least 2 hours (9630).\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nProton pump inhibitors might modestly reduce iron absorption.\nGastric acid is important for the absorption of iron, particularly dietary non-heme iron (4539). However, long-term treatment, up to 12.5 years, with proton pump inhibitors isn't associated with iron depletion or anemia in people with normal iron stores (4483, 8850, 9578). Advise people to maintain adequate dietary iron intake. Supplements aren't necessary unless people have other factors contributing to iron deficiency. For information on foods that are rich in iron, see our chart.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nWhen taken together, iron and quinolone antibiotics can bind together, reducing absorption. When taken separately, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nQuinolones form complexes with iron in the GI tract, which could reduce absorption of both the quinolone and iron if taken at the same time (2682). Significant effects on iron levels are unlikely when quinolones are taken at least two hours before, or four to six hours after, iron supplements or iron-containing foods.\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nWhen taken together, iron and tetracycline antibiotics can bind together, reducing absorption. When taken separately, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nTetracyclines form complexes with iron in the GI tract, reducing absorption of both the tetracycline and iron if taken at the same time (4412, 4549, 4550). Significant effects on iron levels are unlikely when tetracyclines are taken at least two hours before or after iron supplements or iron-containing foods.\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAcute overdosage, 60 mg/kg and more, can cause vomiting and diarrhea, followed by cardiovascular, liver, or metabolic toxicity, and death (7135, 20097, 56582, 112604, 115888). Long-term use of high doses of iron can cause hemosiderosis that clinically resembles hemochromatosis (15).\n\nIron overdose during pregnancy in individuals with peak iron levels over 400 mcg/dL have been associated with organ failure, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and maternal death (20109).\n\nIron supplementation appears to be associated with greater adverse events in children. For example, in a clinical trial of 24,076 children, there was a 12% increase in risk of hospitalization due to severe illness in children taking iron (50163).\nTreatment\nManagement of acute iron poisoning includes intravenous fluids and antiemetics. Intravenous deferoxamine use depends on the severity of symptoms and/or serum levels of iron 4-6 hours after ingestion (112604).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe rate of iron absorption from food and supplements is variable. Heme iron is absorbed at a rate of 23% compared to 2% to 20% for non-heme iron. Non-heme iron is found in all foods containing iron. However, iron from plant sources is only in the non-heme form. Ascorbic acid and ferri-reductase in the duodenum aid in the absorption of dietary non-heme iron. Iron bioavailability from a vegetarian diet is estimated to be 5% to 10%. Meats and fish seem to enhance the absorption of non-heme iron (7135). Supplemental iron reduces non-heme iron absorption from food (56493).\n\nBoiling, stir-frying, or hot air drying appears to enhance the bioavailability of iron contained in some vegetables including asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and corn; however, cold storage of cooked vegetables might greatly reduce the increases in iron bioavailability gained from cooking (5044). Overall, dietary iron absorption is only 10% to 15%. However, this varies significantly depending on the person and the iron demand of the body (403).\n\nVegetarians and people who engage in intense physical exercise, particularly female athletes, may have increased iron requirements (7135). Blood loss and rapid growth also increase gastrointestinal absorption (1101). Iron is stored as ferritin or hemosiderin (7135).\n\nCertain iron formulations are better absorbed than others. For example when ferrous fumarate is given as microencapsulated sprinkles in a maize-based porridge, it appears to be absorbed better (56592). Iron from purified soybean ferritin and also from recombinant human lactoferrin appears to be absorbed as well as ferrous sulfate (56622, 56625). Iron bisglycinate seems to increase iron status more than iron polymaltose or lactoferrin (110189). The frequency of iron administration also seems to impact absorption. A small clinical study shows that taking ferrous sulfate 60 mg on alternate days in single doses appears to improve iron absorption when compared with taking 60 mg daily. However, dividing a daily dose of ferrous sulfate 120 mg twice daily does not improve absorption when compared with taking 120 mg once daily (96630).\nDistribution\nMost of the iron in the human body is incorporated into hemoglobin. The remaining iron is stored in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, or muscle (myoglobin) as ferritin or hemosiderin (7135).\nMetabolism\nIron moves in the body by binding reversibly to the transport protein, transferrin. Two atoms of iron bind to one transferrin and then bind to the transferrin receptor complex. Iron that is transferred into cells can be incorporated into hemoglobin and myoglobin, stored as ferritin, or used to regulate cellular iron metabolism (7135).\nExcretion\nBody iron is highly conserved. In the absence of bleeding (including menstruation) or pregnancy, the body loses only a small quantity of iron each day, mostly through the feces (7135).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIron is a trace mineral found in two ionic forms in the body. It exists in a reduced state as ferrous iron and in an oxidized state as ferric iron. Most of the iron in the body is found in the hemoglobin of red blood cells and in the myoglobin of muscle cells where it is required for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport (1093).\n\nIron also functions in the electron transport chain as an electron carrier in cytochromes. It is also found in the functional groups of most enzymes in the Krebs cycle (945). Iron is an essential cofactor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.\n\nMeats, such as red meat, poultry, and fish provide iron in heme and non-heme forms. Meats contain about 40% heme iron and 60% non-heme iron. Heme iron is absorbed at a rate of 23% compared to 2% to 20% for non-heme iron. Iron from plant sources is only in the non-heme form. Ascorbic acid and ferri-reductase in the duodenum aid in the absorption of non-heme iron. Iron bioavailability from a vegetarian diet is estimated to be 5% to 10%. Meats and fish seem to enhance the absorption of non-heme iron (7135).\n\nThe absorption of iron supplements may be increased by intermittent administration (1-3 doses/week) compared with daily administration. Intermittent administration is thought to align better with intestinal cell turnover, increasing absorption efficiency via increased exposure to new cells. This dosing strategy may also decrease oxidative stress and reduce adverse effects (103806).\n\nIron deficiency anemia in early life seems to negatively affect behavioral and neural development (1093, 9962). Signs and symptoms of deficiency include microcytic and hypochromic anemia, lethargy, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, amenorrhea, hair loss, enlarged liver, and others (7135). Iron deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased perinatal maternal mortality (7135).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in using iron to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research suggests that children with ADHD are more likely to be iron deficient. The level of iron deficiency seems to be positively correlated with the severity of ADHD symptoms. ADHD symptoms are related to dopamine dysfunction where iron seems to plays a role. Iron affects dopamine synthesis and appears to play a role in dopamine receptors density (10700).\nRespiratory effects\nThe cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be linked to accumulation of nitric oxide. Since iron seems to reduce nitric oxide production, this effect might be clinically useful in the suppression of cough induced by ACE inhibitors (7307)."

The fruit is similar to mango and is often referred to as African mango. It is greenish yellow in color with a fibrous pulp surrounding a large hard stone. The seeds of the fruit can be eaten raw or roasted. The kernels yield a food additive used in western and central Africa. The liquid from the kernels is often used in soups and can be used as a suspending and emulsifying agent.

Similar events were observed in controls. Mild nausea has also been reported following the administration of Irvingia gabonensis 0.3-4 grams daily for up to 12 weeks; however, some of these symptoms were alleviated by the addition of milk to the test preparation (61589, 112220).\nless\nHepatic\nOne case of acute hepatitis secondary to Irvingia gabonensis has been reported. A 45-year old male with a ten-day history of Irvingia gabonensis supplementation, at a dose of 350 mg of seed extract twice daily for body fat reduction, was admitted with jaundice, abdominal discomfort, and new onset malaise. His complaints began four days after starting Irvingia gabonensis supplementation. Prior to supplementation, all outpatient laboratory parameters were normal.

The validity of this study is limited by a very small sample size and the lack of a comparator group (104525).\nless\nObesity. Small clinical studies suggest that Irvingia gabonensis may modestly improves weight loss in overweight adults.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking a crude seed extract 1.05 grams orally three times daily, combined with a low-fat, low-calorie diet, reduces weight by about 4 kg after 4 weeks, compared to no weight reduction in those taking placebo (17069). Another preliminary clinical study shows that taking a standardized seed extract (IGOB131) 150 mg twice daily orally for 10 weeks reduces weight by 12.8 kg, compared with 0.7 kg in those taking placebo. However, in this study, overweight patients taking Irvingia gabonensis consumed an average of 2767 kcal/day, compared to 3156 kcal/day in the placebo group (17070). Similar results also occurred in a study using a combination of standardized Irvingia gabonensis seed extract (IGOB131) and Cissus quadrangularis, for 10 weeks (16457). A meta-analysis of these and 2 additional trials in obese or overweight adults shows that taking Irvingia gabonensis 0.3-3.15 grams orally daily for 4-10 weeks reduces body weight by an average of 9%, body fat by 4%, and waist circumference by 7% when compared with placebo. However, the small size, poor quality, and heterogeneity of the included studies limits the validity of these findings (104524). In addition, some research shows conflicting results. Preliminary clinical research in overweight and obese individuals shows that taking a standardized seed extract (IGOB131) 300 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index, or fat mass when compared with placebo (112220). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.

Theoretically, an overdose with Irvingia gabonensis may present similar to overdose with these constituents. However, the effectiveness of administering cyanide or other antidotes to patients with Irvingia gabonensis overdose has not been evaluated.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe digestibility of Irvingia gabonensis seeds has been estimated to range between 94% and 98% (61657). Regarding the digestibility of specific seed components, Irvingia gabonensis has demonstrated a protein digestibility of 0.5% and 0.8% for dehulled and hulled seeds, respectively (61626).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIrvingia gabonensis seeds are the most common part of the plant used for medicinal purposes. The seeds contain a variety of constituents, including saccharides (glucose, arabinose, rhamnose), carbohydrates (starch), protein, fat, amino acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, minerals, heavy metals, polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, plant sterols, tannins, saponins, anthraquinones, alkaloids, aldehydes, aglycones, esters, glycosides, cardiac glycosides, fatty acids (myristic acid, stearic acid, lauric acid), free acids (acetic acid, butyric acid, hexanoic acid, ethyl 3-hydroxybutyrate), monoterpene alcohols, norisoprenoids, terpenoids, steroids, enzymes, ash, gum, pectin, phytate, fiber, and volatile essential oils (17074, 61582, 61583, 61585, 61586, 61588, 61601, 61602, 61603, 61606), (61607, 61609, 61610, 61613, 61614, 61616, 61617, 61618, 61619, 61620), (61621, 61622, 61623, 61624, 61625, 61626, 61627, 61628, 61629, 61630), (61631, 61632, 61633, 61634, 61635, 61636, 61637, 61638, 61639, 61640), (61641, 61642, 61643, 61644, 61645, 61646, 61647, 61650, 61651, 61652, 61653, 61654).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that a water extract of Irvingia gabonensis has analgesic effects against heat-induced pain similar to morphine, while an ethanol extract has analgesic effects against non-heat-induced pain, similar to that of metamizole sodium (17075). The mechanisms of Irvingia gabonensis' analgesic effects are unclear.\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that methanol extracts of Irvingia gabonensis and some of its polyphenoic and triterpene derivatives inhibit the growth of various lines of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17074, 61602, 61586). Three compounds isolated shown to have activity against several Gram-positive and Gram negative bacteria, were identified as 3,3',4'-tri-O-methylellagic acid, 3,4-di-O-methylellagic acid, and a diterpenic acid known as hardwickiic acid (17074). Compared to standard amoxicillin antibiotics, Irvingia gabonensis has demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, possibly due in part to its abundance of constituent alkaloids (61601). In another in vitro study, Irvingia gabonensis was shown to exert a comparable antibacterial effect to that of the standard antibiotic gentamicin (61586).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that methanol extracts of Irvingia gabonensis and some of its polyphenoic and triterpene derivatives inhibit the growth of various strains of fungi, including Candida (17074) and Aspergillus flavus (61600). Three of compounds isolated that have been shown to have activity against Candida yeast species, were identified as 3,3',4'-tri-O-methylellagic acid, 3,4-di-O-methylellagic acid, and a diterpenic acid known as hardwickiic acid (17074). The antifungal effects of Irvingia gabonensis have been shown to be comparable to that of tioconazole and better than that of nystatin, both of which are standard antifungal medications (61586, 61600).\nAntiobesity effects\nIn vitro and in vivo research shows that IGOB131, a marketed Irvingia gabonensis seed extract, inhibits adipogensis by stimulating the expression of adiponectin and downregulatng the expression of both PPAR-gamma and leptin (17072, 92824, 92825). Similarly, various studies involving overweight or obese human subjects have shown that Irvingia gabonensis improves multiple parameters related to obesity, including body weight, body fat, waist and hip circumference, adiponectin activity, and leptin sensitivity (17070, 17069, 16457). It may also modulate glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (92825).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome laboratory research suggests that Irvingia gabonensis has antioxidant effects (13455, 61603, 61604). The abundance of constituent polyphenols has been implicated as playing a role in the antioxidant capacity of Irvingia gabonensis (61603).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that a methanol extract of Irvingia gabonensis reduces gastrointestinal motility, protects against castor oil-induced diarrhea, and dose-dependently inhibits gastric ulceration to a seemingly greater extent than cimetidine, a standard gastric ulcer medication, by means of increased intragastric mucus secretion and decreased gastrtic acid secretion (61584, 61605). The high-soluble fiber content of the seeds acts as a bulk-forming laxative and also delays gastric emptying (16457, 17069).\nHormonal effects\nSome animal research shows that an aqueous extract of Irvingia gabonensis exerts a similar testosterone-increasing effect to that of proviron, a standard steroid (61613).\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nBoth human and animal research suggests that extracts of Irvingia gabonensis may reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (17069, 17070, 61588, 61589, 61591, 61607, 61612, 61615, 61616). The cholesterol-lowering effects of Irvingia gabonensis seeds might be due to their fiber content. The fiber can bind bile acids in the gut, preventing their reabsorption and causing conversion of more cholesterol to bile acids (16457, 17069). The oil extracted from Irvingia gabonensis seeds contains vitamin A, beta-carotene, and phytosterols, which might also contribute to cholesterol-lowering effects (17071).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn vitro, animal, and clinical research all suggest that Irvingia gabonensis has hypoglycemic effects (17069, 17070, 61589, 61591, 61593, 61597, 61598, 61599, 61611). These effects may be explained by inhibition of maltase, sucrase, alpha-amylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity and induction of glucose-6-phosphatase activity (61593, 61597, 61598, 61611) and increased glycogen synthesis due to the compensatory increase of hepatic glycolytic enzyme activity (61593). Irvingia gabonensis was shown to be a weak inhibitor of alpha-amylase activity but a potent inhibitor of both maltase and sucrase (61597). The high-soluble fiber content of the seeds acts as a bulk-forming laxative and delays gastric emptying. This might help improve blood glucose control in diabetes (16457, 17069).\nInsecticidal effects\nIn grain, Irvingia gabonensis has been shown to inhibit the activity of insect pests and provide significant protection against pest infestation (61608). Conversely, a diethyl ether extract of Irvingia gabonensis has been shown to be a potent attractant to older, but not younger, Oryzaephilus mercator beetles, irrespective of diurnal cycle (61656)."

Isatis extracts seem to inhibit the release of histamine and serotonin from mast cells. Isatis extracts also seem to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not COX-1 or 5-lipoxygenase, which are mediators of inflammatory activity (12641). Tryptanthrin, an isatis leaf constituent that is produced during the drying process, inhibits both cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (12641, 12646, 12647). Indirubin, a constituent of isatis root, might inhibit airway inflammation produced by the influenza virus, according to preliminary research (12640). Another isatis root constituent, isaindigotone, seems to be a superoxide scavenger and inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene B4 production, which might also contribute to an isatis anti-inflammatory effect (12645)."

Preliminary research suggests that the fruit constituent pectin has hypoglycemic activity (12249, 12694, 12696). Ivy gourd leaf extracts depress gluconeogenesis by inhibiting enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase (12697). Triterpene constituents of ivy gourd leaf have antidiabetic activity and may also improve metabolic function (12698). Other preliminary research suggests ivy gourd leaf extract might stimulate insulin production and have antioxidant effects (12699).\nHypolipidemic effects\nTriterpene constituents of ivy gourd leaf may lower cholesterol and improve metabolic function (12698). In adults with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, taking ivy gourd aqueous leaf extract, 500 mg once daily for 3 months, lowers triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by a small amount when compared with baseline, but does not affect other lipids (110430).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research shows that application of a hydrogel containing a methanolic extract of ivy gourd to wounds infected by Bacillus cereus inhibits bacterial growth and improves wound healing when compared with a placebo hydrogel. The antibacterial activity and healing effects of the ivy gourd topical extract were close to that of fusidic acid, a topical antibiotic used for bacterial skin infections. The wound healing effects of ivy gourd are thought to be related to the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and skin rejuvenating activity of various constituents (102045)."
