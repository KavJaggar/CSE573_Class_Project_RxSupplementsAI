            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of maca is the root. Dried maca root contains 55% to 60% carbohydrates; 10% to 12% protein; 8% to 9% fiber; and 2% to 3% lipids, including linolenic, palmitic, and oleic acids. It also contains sterols such as campesterol, stigmasterol, and beta-sitosterol, and significant amounts of minerals including iron, calcium, copper, and zinc, as well as amino acids and B, C, and E vitamins (9929, 40231, 90606, 104516).\n\nTwo classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, macaenes and macamides, are used as marker compounds for maca (9926). Analysis of commercially available maca products shows that the percentage of total macaenes and macamides in preparations varies from 0.15% to 0.84% (9926).\n\nMaca also contains glucosinolates, including glucotropaeolin (9927, 9929, 60714). The major components of the steam-distilled essential oil of maca are phenyl acetonitrile (85.9%), benzaldehyde (3.1%), and 3-methoxyphenylacetonitrile (2.1%) (60707). Other constituents of maca include (5-oxo-(6E,8E)-octadecadienoic acid), lepidiline A and B, (1R,3S)-1-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, and macaridine (9927, 60704, 60708).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research in mice shows that pretreatment with maca extract before strenuous exercise may reduce post-exercise levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase, lactic acid, and blood urea nitrogen when compared with a control group. These effects were similar to those seen with caffeine (108602).\nAnti-stress effects\nIn animal research, maca extract improved several markers associated with stress including ulcers, elevated corticosterone levels, and adrenal weights (60730).\nAnticancer effects\nMaca contains glucosinolates, which might have cancer-protecting properties (9927, 9929).\nAntidepressant effects\nIn animal research, maca reduced times of immobility associated with forced swimming, suggesting antidepressant effects (60724).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research in muscle cell models designed to simulate exercise-induced oxidative damage shows that maca extract may attenuate oxidative effects by preventing the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity and preserving mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Research in mice shows that pretreatment with maca extract before strenuous exercise may reduce oxidative stress-induced muscle damage by decreasing levels of reactive oxygen species in both blood and muscle (108602).\nCentral nervous system effects\nMaca contains glucosinolates, which might have central nervous system effects (9927, 9929). The carboline, (1R,3S)-1-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, found in maca has been reported to exert many activities on the central nervous system (9927).\nCognitive effects\nIn animal research, maca reduced time required to find water, suggesting beneficial effects on memory (60724).\nExercise effects\nIn animal research, maca extracts increased swimming activity and improved recovery from muscle fatigue based on production of lactic and malonic acids (60732). Other animal research in mice shows that administration of maca extract daily for 4 weeks improves grip strength and exercise endurance more than a control group and similarly to caffeine. Maca also appears to attenuate exercise-induced muscle fatigue and stress by increasing muscle concentrations of coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and NAD(H) and reducing markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (108602).\nFertility effects\nIn female animals, maca extract increased litter size (60718). However, in other animal research it did not increase implantation of embryos (60709).\nImmunostimulant effects\nIn animal research, diets supplemented with maca resulted in increased leukocyte counts (60733). Similarly, a small study in mice with immunocompromise due to cyclophosphamide suggests that maca polysaccharides improve immune cell counts, including white blood cells, CD4+ T cells, interleukin-2, and interferon-gamma when compared with control (112013). However, in human research, maca did not affect levels of cytokines involved in immunity (90606).\nOsteoporosis effects\nIn animal research, maca extract prevented bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency (60722).\nReproductive effects\nMaca and extracts containing macaene and macamide seem to increase sexual activity and correct erectile dysfunction in animal models. The mechanism for this activity is unknown (10218, 60700, 60702, 60706). Also in animal models, maca increases spermatogenesis and epididymal sperm count (60710, 60711, 60715, 60723), as well as the weight of the testis and epididymis (60703). However, when different types of maca are compared in rats, only the black variety appears to improve spermatogenesis (60719).\n\nMaca does not appear to significantly affect serum concentrations of reproductive hormones including testosterone, estradiol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in healthy males (10219, 112012). In males with various combinations of oligospermia, asthenospermia, teratospermia, and azoospermia, taking yellow maca 2.8 grams daily for 16 weeks also does not appear to significantly affect serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, estradiol, or testosterone (108603). However, estrogenic effects of maca have been shown in laboratory research in human breast cancer cell lines (18290). Also, in animal research, maca resulted in increased progesterone, but not estrogen, levels in females (60709) and increased testosterone levels in males (60709)."

If the macadamia nuts are added to the existing diet, increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol also occur. However, if fat from other sources is removed from the diet, HDL seems to decrease (12598, 12599, 100024). In hypercholesteremic adults eating 40-90 grams of macadamia nuts (about 17-37 nuts) daily for 4 weeks in addition to their usual diet, total cholesterol is decreased by 3% and LDL cholesterol is decreased by 5% when compared to baseline (12598).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Madagascar periwinkle are the above ground parts and the root. The leaves and flowers of the plant contain approximately 130 different terpenoid indole alkaloids (100663, 100666). These alkaloids include vincristine, vinblastine, and leurosine (100663, 100666). The precursors to these alkaloids, catharanthine and vindoline, are found in the leaf wax exudate and leaf cells, respectively (100664). The leaf also contains flavonoids and polyphenols, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, coumaric acid, and rutin (104765). The root contains flavonoid glucosides, beta-sitosterol, and 3-epibetulinic acid, as well as small quantities of catharanthine and tabersonine (100667).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe flavonoid glucosides derived from the root of Madagascar periwinkle have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro research shows that the flavonoid glucosides inhibit the production of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (100667).\nAnticancer effects\nThe indole alkaloid constituents of Madagascar periwinkle have demonstrated potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Two constituents, vinblastine and vincristine, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as chemotherapeutic agents (6). The FDA-approved vinca alkaloids work primarily by binding tubulin and inhibiting cell mitosis (6, 15). Other indole alkaloid constituents, including cathachunine, catharanthine, ajmalicine, tabersonine, lochnericine, and leurosine have also been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells via mediation of the NF-kB and JNK pathways. When used in combination, these compounds are believed to act synergistically (100663, 100666).\nAntidiabetes effects\nMadagascar periwinkle is traditionally used for the treatment of diabetes. Animal research shows that vindoline, a constituent of Madagascar periwinkle, reduces blood glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test in diabetic rats (104764).\n\nIn vitro research shows that vindolidine, vindolicine, and vindolinine, isolated from the leaf extract, inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), a protein involved in the development of diabetes and insulin resistance (100662). Other in vitro research shows that Madagascar periwinkle leaf extract may increase beta-cell viability during exposure to high concentrations of glucose, increase insulin secretion, and inhibit alpha glucosidase activity. Vindoline, a leaf constituent, appears to be responsible for at least part of this antidiabetic activity. Although some extracts of the leaf appear to decrease alpha amylase activity, other leaf extracts appear to increase alpha amylase activity (104765).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that Madagascar periwinkle leaf extract and vindolicine and vindoline, constituents of the leaf extract, have antioxidant activity. Vindolicine and vindoline scavenge free radicals and alleviate peroxide-induced oxidative damage in pancreatic cells (100662, 104765, 104764).\nCardiovascular effects\nReserpine and alstonine, constituents of the above ground parts of the plant, have hypotensive activity (6). Another constituent, ajmalicine, may have activity in the enhancement of cerebral blood flow (6).\nDiuretic effects\nThe constituent catharanthine is reported to have diuretic effects (6).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that vindoline, a constituent of Madagascar periwinkle, decreases serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increases serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in diabetic rats (104764).\nRenoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that vindoline, a constituent of Madagascar periwinkle, decreases serum creatinine concentrations in diabetic rats (104764)."

The anti-diarrheal effects of madder have been shown in animal models. Madder appears to slow down intestinal transit (99990).\nAntimicrobial effects\nMadder is used topically for various skin conditions and for wound healing. In vitro, madder extract had antibacterial and antifungal effects (99989, 99991).\nAntiviral effects\nAlizarin, a constituent of madder root, and alizarin derivatives have been found to be competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 protease, an important drug target for HIV (20055).\nCalcium oxalate crystallization effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that the madder root constituent alizarin can inhibit crystallization of calcium oxalate and phosphate under physiological conditions (20056). A reduction in calcium oxalate crystallization in the kidney might inhibit kidney or bladder stones (2). In a rat model of urolithiasis, administration of ethanolic and ethylene acetate extracts of madder root decreases crystal formation and size in a dose-dependent manner and attenuates urolithiasis-induced changes in serum and urinary biochemical parameters. Effects of the ethanolic extract appear to be more pronounced than those of the ethylene acetate extract, likely due to increased antioxidant activity and greater polyphenol content (105848)."

    "Magnesium": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Magnesium is a chemical element that is important for normal bone structure (272). It also plays an essential role in many cellular reactions in the body (945). Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium (13382). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, some vegetables, seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee (8088, 12504, 12505). Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly in females, African Americans, and the elderly (8088, 8099, 8998, 9001, 12504, 12505, 12510, 12511).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately.

Parenteral magnesium sulfate is an FDA-approved prescription product (96484).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily frequently cause loose stools and diarrhea (7555).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 65 mg daily for children 1 to 3 years, 110 mg daily for children 4 to 8 years, and 350 mg daily for children older than 8 years (7555, 89396). ...when used parenterally and appropriately (96483).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Higher doses can cause diarrhea and symptomatic hypermagnesemia including hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia (7555, 8095).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe for those pregnant and breast-feeding when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily (7555).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for up to 5 days (12592, 89397, 99354, 99355). However, due to potential adverse effects associated with intravenous and intramuscular magnesium, use during pregnancy is limited to patients with specific conditions such as severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. There is some evidence that intravenous magnesium can increase fetal mortality and adversely affect neurological and skeletal development (12590, 12593, 60818, 99354, 99355). However, a more recent analysis of clinical research shows that increased risk of fetal mortality seems to occur only in the studies where antenatal magnesium is used for tocolysis and not for fetal neuroprotection or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (102457). Furthermore, antenatal magnesium does not seem to be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (104396). There is also concern that magnesium increases the risk of maternal adverse events. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate might increase the risk of maternal adverse events, especially in Hispanic mothers compared to other racial and ethnic groups (60971, 99319).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients to avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily. Taking magnesium orally in higher doses can cause diarrhea (7555). ...when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for longer than 5 days (12592, 89397, 99354, 99355). Maternal exposure to magnesium for longer than 5-7 days is associated with an increase in neonatal bone abnormalities such as osteopenia and fractures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that magnesium injection not be given for longer than 5-7 days (12590, 12593, 60818, 99354, 99355).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nMagnesium is generally well tolerated. Some clinical research shows no differences in adverse effects between placebo and magnesium groups.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nIntravenously: Bradycardia, dizziness, flushing sensation, hypotension, and localized pain and irritation. In pregnancy, may cause blurry vision, dizziness, lethargy, nausea, nystagmus, and perception of warmth.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll ROAs: With toxic doses, loss of reflexes and respiratory depression can occur. High doses in pregnancy can increase risk of neonatal mortality and neurological defects.\nCardiovascular\nIntravenously, magnesium can cause bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypotension (13356, 60795, 60838, 60872, 60960, 60973, 60982, 61001, 61031, 114681). Inhaled magnesium administered by nebulizer may also cause hypotension (113466). Magnesium sulfate may cause rapid heartbeat when administered antenatally (60915, 114681).\n\nIn one case report, a 99-year-old male who took oral magnesium oxide 3000 mg daily for chronic constipation was hospitalized with hypermagnesemia, hypotension, bradycardia, heart failure, cardiomegaly, second-degree sinoatrial block, and complete bundle branch block. The patient recovered after discontinuing the magnesium oxide (108966).\nless\nDermatologic\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause flushing, sweating, and problems at the injection site (including burning pain) (60960, 60982, 111696, 114681). In a case study, two patients who received intravenous magnesium sulfate for suppression of preterm labor developed a rapid and sudden onset of an urticarial eruption (a skin eruption of itching welts). The eruption cleared when magnesium sulfate was discontinued (61045). Orally, magnesium oxide may cause allergic skin rash, but this is rare. In one case report, a patient developed a rash after taking 600 mg magnesium oxide (Maglax) (98291).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, magnesium can cause gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (1194, 4891, 10661, 10663, 18111, 60951, 61016, 98290). In rare cases, taking magnesium orally might cause a bezoar, an indigestible mass of material which gets lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. In a case report, a 75-year-old female with advanced rectal cancer taking magnesium 1500 mg daily presented with nausea and anorexia from magnesium oxide bezoars in her stomach (99314). Magnesium can cause nausea, vomiting, or dry mouth when administered intravenously or by nebulization (60818, 60960, 60982, 104400, 113466, 114681). Antenatal magnesium sulfate may also cause nausea and vomiting (60915, 114681). Two case reports suggest that giving magnesium 50 grams orally for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in patients with colorectal cancer may lead to intestinal perforation and possibly death (90006).\n\nDelayed meconium passage and obstruction have been reported rarely in neonates after intravenous magnesium sulfate was given to the mother during pregnancy (60818). In a retrospective study of 200 neonates born prematurely before 32 weeks of gestation, administration of prenatal IV magnesium sulfate, as a 4-gram loading dose and then 1-2 grams hourly, was not associated with the rate of meconium bowel obstruction when compared with neonates whose mothers had not received magnesium sulfate (108728).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIntravenously, magnesium sulfate may cause renal toxicity or acute urinary retention, although these events are rare (60818, 61012). A case of slowed cervical dilation at delivery has been reported for a patient administered intravenous magnesium sulfate for eclampsia (12592). Intravenous magnesium might also cause solute diuresis. In a case report, a pregnant patient experienced polyuria and diuresis after having received intravenous magnesium sulfate in Ringer's lactate solution for preterm uterine contractions (98284).\nless\nHematologic\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause increased blood loss at delivery when administered for eclampsia or pre-eclampsia (12592). However, research on the effect of intravenous magnesium on postpartum hemorrhage is mixed. Some research shows that it does not affect risk of postpartum hemorrhage (60982), while other research shows that intrapartum magnesium administration is associated with increased odds of postpartum hemorrhage, increased odds of uterine atony (a condition that increases the risk for postpartum hemorrhage) and increased need for red blood cell transfusions (97489).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause decreased skeletal muscle tone, muscle weakness, or hypocalcemic tetany (60818, 60960, 60973).\n\nAlthough magnesium is important for normal bone structure and maintenance (272), there is concern that very high doses of magnesium may be detrimental. In a case series of 9 patients receiving long-term tocolysis for 11-97 days, resulting in cumulative magnesium sulfate doses of 168-3756 grams, a lower bone mass was noted in 4 cases receiving doses above 1000 grams. There was one case of pregnancy- and lactation-associated osteoporosis and one fracture (108731). The validity and clinical significance of this data is unclear.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause slurred speech, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, or headaches (60818, 60960, 114681). With toxic doses, loss of reflexes, neurological defects, drowsiness, confusion, and coma can occur (8095, 12589, 12590).\n\nA case report describes cerebral cortical and subcortical edema consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), eclampsia, somnolence, seizures, absent deep tendon reflexes, hard to control hypertension, acute renal failure and hypermagnesemia (serum level 11.5 mg/dL), after treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate for preeclampsia in a 24-year-old primigravida at 39 weeks gestation with a previously uncomplicated pregnancy. The symptoms resolved after 4 days of symptomatic treatment in an intensive care unit, and emergency cesarian delivery of a healthy infant (112785).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause blurred vision (114681). Additionally, cases of visual impairment or nystagmus have been reported following magnesium supplementation, but these events are rare (18111, 60818).\nless\nPsychiatric\nA case of delirium due to hypermagnesemia has been reported for a patient receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate for pre-eclampsia (60780).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nIntravenously, magnesium may cause respiratory depression and tachypnea when used in toxic doses (12589, 61028, 61180).\nless\nOther\nHypothermia from magnesium used as a tocolytic has been reported (60818).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nBowel preparation. Various magnesium salts are used for cleansing the bowel prior to procedures such as colonoscopy.\nVarious magnesium salts, including citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate, are ingredients in bowel preparation products available over-the-counter or by prescription only.\nless\nConstipation. Magnesium salts are effective when used short-term orally to treat constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC).\nMagnesium citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate salts are commonly used as laxatives. Magnesium citrate 11.3-17.45 grams has been used; magnesium hydroxide 2.4-4.8 grams, as 30-60 mL of milk of magnesia, has also been used (113483, 113484). Magnesium sulfate, also known as Epsom salt, which seems to have the most potent effect, has been used as 10-30 grams (6430, 113485). Magnesium salts should only be used for occasional treatment of constipation, and doses should be taken with a full 8-ounce glass of water.\n\nMagnesium oxide seems to be beneficial in adults with CIC when taken short-term. Clinical guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association and American College of Gastroenterology in 2023 give a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of magnesium oxide over managing CIC without magnesium oxide based on low-quality studies conducted over 4 weeks. The recommended starting dose is 400-500 mg daily with dose titration per symptom response and side effects (112859). A small clinical study in patients with CIC who are not taking chronic medications shows that taking magnesium oxide 1.5 grams in three divided doses daily for 28 days increases spontaneous bowel movements when compared with placebo (104397). It is unknown if magnesium is beneficial for CIC when used long-term.\nless\nDyspepsia. Magnesium salts are effective when used orally as antacids.\nMagnesium carbonate, hydroxide, oxide, or trisilicate salts are used orally as antacids to reduce symptoms of gastric hyperacidity or gastroesophageal reflux. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action. The onset for magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure. Magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration of action due to poor solubility (6844). Doses used include magnesium hydroxide 400-1200 mg (5-15 mL of milk of magnesia) up to four times daily, or magnesium oxide 800 mg daily (15).\nless\nEclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for control of seizures.\nIntravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (15, 12591, 12592, 61012, 61184). Typical doses include 4-6 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily (15, 12591). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that treatment with IV or IM magnesium reduces the risk of seizure recurrence by 33% to 69% when compared with phenytoin, and by 47% to 60% when compared with diazepam (19960, 60818, 60954, 60964, 61105). One preliminary clinical study shows that lower doses of IV magnesium sulfate (9 grams loading dose and maintenance of 2.5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) are as effective as higher doses (14 grams loading dose and maintenance of 5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) for reducing the recurrence of eclamptic seizures (89383). It is generally recommended that treatment be continued for at least 24 hours after the last seizure (15). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for eclampsia.\nless\nHypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can be effectively treated with oral or parenteral magnesium.\nTaking magnesium orally or parenterally is helpful for treating and preventing hypomagnesemia associated with alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, congestive heart failure (CHF), severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, kidney dysfunction, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pancreatitis, malabsorption syndromes, and other conditions (6280, 6281, 8088, 8089).\n\nThe dose and salt of magnesium for oral replacement therapy should be chosen carefully to avoid causing diarrhea. The gluconate and chloride salts cause less diarrhea, while the oxide salt is more likely to cause diarrhea and should be avoided. Magnesium chloride should also be avoided due to poor solubility which decreases absorption (6430, 8099, 10664). Orally, magnesium sulfate 3 grams every 6 hours for four doses has been used for hypomagnesemia (15). Parenteral magnesium doses must be individualized according to serum magnesium levels, but a typical starting dose for mild deficiency is 1 gram of magnesium sulfate intramuscularly (IM) every 6 hours for 4 doses (15). For more severe deficiency, 5 grams of magnesium sulfate may be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion in 1 liter of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution over 3 hours (15).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis in patients with pre-eclampsia.\nIntravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during pre-eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (12591, 12592, 61012, 61184). Some meta-analyses show that IV administration of magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of eclampsia when compared with placebo, phenytoin, or diazepam in patients with pre-eclampsia (19960, 60818, 60960, 60979). A typical initial dose is 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams of magnesium sulfate per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily (15, 12591). The optimal duration of prophylaxis has not been determined. A meta-analysis suggests that using a shorter duration of 12 hours or less is not associated with an increase in risk of eclamptic seizures when compared with regimens of 24 hours or longer (108732). However, studies are likely underpowered due to the low incidence of eclampsia.\n\nOral magnesium has been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in healthy adults, but taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily, starting at 12-20 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, does not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo (103724).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCerebral palsy. Most evidence shows that antenatal magnesium reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants, although there are some inconsistent results.\nMost clinical studies and meta-analyses show that antenatal magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of cerebral palsy by about 32% and the risk of motor dysfunction by about 45% in preterm infants (60915, 60927, 60931, 61001, 97485, 103734, 103754, 114675, 114681). The lowest effective dose of magnesium sulfate seems to be 4 grams intravenously, with or without a maintenance dose of 1 gram/hour until birth or for 24 hours. In obese females, a higher dose, based on body weight, may be needed (97485, 97495, 103734, 103754). However, some studies have inconsistent results (8093, 19998, 98293, 98295, 112784). Giving females at risk of imminent preterm birth (prior to 32 weeks), intravenous magnesium sulfate 4.5 grams over 20 minutes followed by 1 gram per hour until birth or for 24 hours, in addition to a standard treatment protocol, does not reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy (112784).\n\nOral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nless\nSeizures. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for treating seizures of various etiologies.\nIntravenous magnesium sulfate may be useful for controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis, hypothyroidism, and acute nephritis in children (15). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nless\nTorsades de pointes. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the first-line treatment for torsades de pointes after measures to correct precipitating factors have been unsuccessful.\nIntravenous magnesium sulfate has been used successfully to treat the life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes (15, 6844). The Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines of the American Heart Association recommend a dose of 1 to 2 grams diluted in 50-100 mL Dextrose 5% solution given IV over 5-60 minutes, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-1 gram/hour.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nArrhythmia. Magnesium sulfate is effective for the specific type of ventricular tachycardia known as torsades de pointes, and seems to be helpful for treating other types of arrhythmias. Evidence for the role of oral or intravenous magnesium in preventing postoperative arrhythmias is conflicting.\nAdministering magnesium intravenously or orally may be helpful for treating atrial and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia (9497, 13352, 13354, 13355, 13356, 60804, 60829, 60877, 61113, 111696). Arrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure have been treated with magnesium sulfate 8 grams infused over 12 hours (9497). For rate control in atrial fibrillation, magnesium sulfate 2.5 grams IV over 20 minutes, followed by 2.5 grams IV over 2 hours has been used (13356). For paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, single doses of 1-4 grams of magnesium chloride have been used (13352). For atrial tachycardia, 2 grams of magnesium sulfate in 10 mL of dextrose 5% solution has been given IV over 1-10 minutes, followed by 5-10 grams of magnesium sulfate in 250-500 mL dextrose 5% solution as an IV infusion over 5 hours (13354, 13355).\n\nResearch on the effects of intravenous magnesium for preventing arrhythmias after cardiac surgery is conflicting. Some meta-analyses show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery by 23% to 48% when compared with placebo (60814, 60826, 60828, 60838, 61008, 61033, 61181, 97487, 97490). Doses of magnesium sulfate used include 30 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline (97490), or 80-100 mg/kg added to the cardioplegia solution (97487). Also, one small study in adults after CABG surgery suggests that taking magnesium hydroxide 1600 mg orally reduces arrhythmia as effectively as receiving magnesium sulfate 2000 mg intravenously (99315). However, other meta-analyses that only include higher-quality trials show that magnesium supplementation does not reduce the risk of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery (61010, 61024, 61031, 105081).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials of intravenous magnesium for prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after non-cardiac surgeries shows that it does not reduce the incidence significantly when compared with placebo (112778). However, there was a high risk of bias in the analysis, and variability in types of surgery, and the salt and dose of magnesium used.\nless\nAsthma. Parenteral magnesium sulfate can help to reverse severe acute asthma attacks and reduce the need for hospital admission. It is unclear if nebulized magnesium is beneficial for acute asthma attacks. However, oral magnesium does not seem to be beneficial.\nOverall, a single dose of intravenous magnesium seems to improve pulmonary function in acute asthma exacerbation and reduce the risk of hospitalization, particularly in patients with severe asthma, and those who have failed initial treatment with nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids (60888, 90023, 96483, 104398, 107365). The typical dose used for adults is 2 grams of magnesium sulfate infused over 20 minutes (15). For children, 25-75 mg/kg, to a maximum of 2 grams, infused over 20-30 minutes has been used (15, 96483, 107365). However, a post-hoc analysis of one large clinical trial (104400) designed to assess nebulized magnesium in children with acute asthma has found that adding IV magnesium to nebulized magnesium is associated with greater odds of hospitalization when compared with no IV magnesium (105919). This post-hoc analysis did not differentiate between precautionary and necessary hospitalizations.\n\nAlthough some clinical research and a meta-analysis in patients with acute asthma exacerbation show that nebulized magnesium in combination with standard treatment improves airway function, respiratory rate, and clinical asthma severity when compared with standard treatment alone, it is unclear whether these findings are clinically relevant (90016, 113466). Most evidence, including larger clinical trials and meta-analyses, has not shown benefit of adjunct nebulized magnesium for acute asthma in adults or children (60888, 90002, 96484, 104400, 105920, 113466, 114674). Oral magnesium also does not seem to be beneficial. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in children and adults with asthma shows that taking magnesium supplements orally does not improve lung function or reduce bronchodilator use when compared with control (104404).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Increasing dietary magnesium intake seems to lower the risk of colon cancer but not rectal cancer.\nEpidemiological research shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer, but the risk of rectal cancer is not affected (89387, 90017, 90027, 101355).\nless\nDiabetes. Low dietary magnesium may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but evidence on the use of supplements for treating type 2 diabetes is conflicting.\nHigher dietary magnesium intake is associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations and a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults and obese children (13369, 15548, 96473, 97486, 98294, 103736, 105918, 106920). In people with existing type 2 diabetes, hypomagnesemia is found in 25% to 38% of patients, especially in those with poorly controlled diabetes (1172). Population research in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that a dietary magnesium intake of less than 250 mg daily is associated with a 56% higher risk of mortality. Preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that the risk of mortality is higher in those with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels above 7% (110051).\n\nA meta-analysis of small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that magnesium may modestly reduce HbA1C in patients with hypomagnesemia, but not in patients with normal magnesium levels, when compared with control (105075). Individual clinical studies using magnesium supplements in patients with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance have shown mixed results. Some research suggests magnesium supplements can decrease fasting blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity, as well as reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high-risk patients (10664, 12582, 13376, 60854, 99313, 106920), but other research shows no effect (1171, 1172, 13379, 13380, 112780). Discrepancies in these findings might reflect differences in magnesium salts and doses used, or differences in baseline magnesium status in study subjects.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Magnesium may help improve lipid levels by a small amount in people with this condition.\nThere is some evidence that taking magnesium oxide 1 gram orally daily for 6 weeks can produce small decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels, and small increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, magnesium does not seem to improve lipoprotein (a) levels (1193). Magnesium may also lower triglycerides in people with hypertriglyceridemia (97494).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Low dietary and serum levels of magnesium seem to be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome.\nHigher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is associated with a 27% lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy females (13371) and a 31% lower risk in healthy young adults (14304). Additional epidemiological research suggests that people with low serum magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels (13372). In a population analysis of over 6000 individuals without metabolic syndrome at baseline, the risk of developing this condition over a 6-year follow-up period was reduced by 16% in the highest quintile of dietary magnesium intake (median intake 371 mg daily) when compared with the lowest quintile (median intake 203 mg daily). Some, but not all, research suggests that the hazard ratio for metabolic syndrome in relation to magnesium intake may be U-shaped, with higher risk at intakes below about 150 mg daily and above 600 mg daily (108963).\n\nA combination of magnesium 20 mEq daily and potassium 40 mEq daily (magnesium potassium citrate) taken orally for 16 weeks reverses metabolic side effects of chlorthalidone, such as increased fasting plasma glucose and hypokalemia, more effectively than potassium chloride 40 mEq daily alone (112932).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Increased dietary and supplemental magnesium intake seems to increase bone mineral density and decrease bone loss in postmenopausal patients.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking magnesium hydroxide orally, 300-1800 mg daily for 6 months, then 600 mg daily for 18 months, or magnesium citrate orally 1830 mg daily for 30 days, might reduce bone loss and bone turnover in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis (9104, 60928). Some epidemiological research also suggests that magnesium intake is related to increased bone mineral density (12501, 12502, 12503, 12504, 90014), although not all studies have found an association (12505, 98286).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Injectable magnesium has been used with promising results for reducing pain and the need for other analgesics postoperatively. However, it is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative pain.\nA meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 5-50 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 6 mg/kg or 500 mg hourly during surgery, seems to reduce the 24-hour postoperative use of IV morphine by 24% when compared with placebo (19968). Adding IV magnesium sulfate 3.7-5.5 grams to patient-controlled analgesia for 24 hours after surgery has also been used (19968). Additionally, meta-analyses support that adjunctive IV or intrathecal administration of magnesium reduces post-operative pain scores, improves pain relief and sensory nerve block, and decreases the need for other analgesics, when compared with control (89390, 90012, 90015, 98287, 103728, 114676, 114677, 114678). However, some data are conflicting. In a meta-analysis of 7 trials, IV magnesium was not associated with lower pain scores over the first 48 hours postoperatively. The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied. Additionally, IV magnesium appears to be less effective than dexmedetomidine (105082).\n\nTwo moderate-sized clinical studies in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in China show that adding magnesium sulfate 2.5 mg/mL to the periarticular infiltration analgesia (PIA) cocktail or administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg before anesthesia induction then as a 15 mg/kg infusion during surgery reduces pain scores, increases comfort levels, limits and delays the use of postoperative opioids, prolongs analgesia, and reduces markers of inflammation when compared with the usual PIA cocktail or control (111181, 113677). Administering magnesium intravenously also seems to be helpful for pain control after hysterectomy. A 3-gram IV bolus of magnesium sulfate followed by an infusion of 0.5 grams per hour for 20 hours has been used. Lower doses were not effective (6848). In males undergoing laparoscopic radical resection for gastrointestinal cancer, administering IV magnesium intraoperatively, as a loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg/hour through the end of surgery, reduces postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort and analgesic requirements, when compared with placebo (112783). However, IV magnesium might not alleviate postoperative pain in children. Two small clinical studies show that administering a magnesium IV infusion does not reduce pain when compared with saline in children after tonsillectomy or after elective strabismus surgery (98282, 105077).\n\nOral magnesium has also been evaluated for postoperative pain. A small, single-center, clinical study in Thailand in adults undergoing oral surgery and taking postoperative ibuprofen shows that adding magnesium (Magnesium, Life Extension) 500 mg once prior to surgery and daily for 3 days post-surgery slightly improves self-reported pain at rest after 24 hours but not at other time points when compared with placebo (116617). These results are unlikely to be clinically significant.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Taking magnesium orally seems to relieve symptoms of PMS.\nThere is some evidence that magnesium supplementation can improve symptoms, including mood changes and fluid retention, in some patients with PMS (1187, 1188, 6847). Doses used include magnesium oxide 333 mg daily for 2 menstrual cycles, or magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid equivalent to 360 mg elemental magnesium three times daily, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle until onset of menstrual flow (1187, 1188). Taking magnesium orally in a dose of 360 mg (elemental magnesium) three times daily for 2 months seems to prevent premenstrual migraine (1186, 6847). A combination of magnesium 200 mg daily plus vitamin B6 50 mg daily seems to reduce anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms, including nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, when compared with placebo (8555).\nless\nVasospastic angina. Intravenous magnesium seems to prevent coronary spasm in patients with this condition.\nClinical research shows that administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate 65 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes dilates coronary arteries and suppresses acetylcholine-induced coronary spasms when compared with infusion of a dextrose solution in patients with vasospastic angina (8091).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAltitude sickness. Taking magnesium citrate orally does not seem to reduce acute altitude sickness risk.\nClinical research shows that taking magnesium citrate 1200 mg daily orally in three divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to mountain ascent and continuing until mountain descent, does not reduce the risk of acute altitude sickness when compared with placebo (60801).\nless\nAthletic performance. Taking magnesium orally does not seem to improve energy or endurance during athletic activity.\nMost evidence suggests that taking magnesium orally doesn't increase energy and endurance during athletic activity. Magnesium oxide, aspartate, and orotate salts do not seem to improve exercise performance when used alone or in combination with potassium, vitamin B6, or zinc (2825, 2826, 2828, 2829, 2830, 60751, 113655).\nless\nBronchiolitis. Intravenous or nebulized magnesium is not beneficial in infants with this condition.\nClinical research shows that administering a single IV dose of magnesium sulfate 100 mg/kg to infants with acute bronchiolitis does not improve, and may actually worsen, symptoms when compared with placebo (97482). A clinical study in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis shows that adding nebulized magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg to nebulized epinephrine does not reduce hospital stay or the need for ventilator or oxygen support when compared with epinephrine alone (99317). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this use.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Research on the effects of intravenous infusions of magnesium and calcium for preventing oxaliplatin neurotoxicity are inconsistent, but higher quality studies seem to show no benefit.\nPooled analyses of cohort studies and clinical trials show that calcium and magnesium infusions can decrease the incidence of severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity (90028, 90029, 90031). However, when only clinical trials are considered, the infusions do not appear to be helpful (90005, 90029, 90031, 96474, 96479).\nless\nComplex regional pain syndrome. Intravenous magnesium is not beneficial in complex regional pain syndrome type 1.\nClinical research shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 70 mg/kg intravenously at the rate of 25 mL/hour for 4 hours each day for 5 days does not improve pain or level of impairment when compared with placebo in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (89395).\nless\nEmergence delirium. The majority of small clinical studies in adults and children undergoing various surgeries suggest that intravenous (IV) magnesium doesn't reduce the risk of emergence delirium. However, most clinical studies in adults suggest that IV magnesium reduces emergence agitation.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing surgery for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair shows that administering IV magnesium 30 mg/kg as a loading dose, followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion for the duration of surgery, does not improve agitation or delirium scores when compared with administering saline (111182). Similarly, a small clinical study in children ages 2-5 years undergoing elective strabismus surgery shows that administering IV magnesium during anesthesia does not seem to prevent the occurrence of emergence delirium when compared with administering saline (105077). In a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials in children aged 2-16 years undergoing general anesthesia for oral or ophthalmic surgery, giving IV magnesium as a 30 mg/kg loading dose followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion, or as a single dose of 15-30 mg/kg, does not reduce emergence delirium scores, and may actually prolong emergence times (108729).\n\nHowever, there is some conflicting evidence. In patients undergoing radical mastectomy, giving intraoperative magnesium sulfate 30mg/kg over 1 hour, followed by 10 mg/kg/hour until the end of surgery, reduces emergence agitation (odds ratio 0.26) when compared with placebo (112781).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral magnesium oxide does not seem to be beneficial for menopausal hot flashes.\nA small, low quality study in postmenopausal patients with a history of breast cancer shows that taking magnesium oxide 400-800 mg orally daily reduces hot flashes when compared with baseline (102454). However, a larger, higher quality clinical study using magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily did not show any benefit when compared with placebo (98290).\nless\nMuscle cramps. Oral magnesium does not seem to improve muscle cramp frequency or intensity.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical trials show that magnesium supplementation for 3-6 weeks does not decrease the frequency or intensity of skeletal muscle cramps, whether the cramps are idiopathic or due to liver cirrhosis or pregnancy, when compared with placebo (90022, 104395).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral magnesium does not seem beneficial for improving metabolic indices in patients with PCOS.\nA meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical studies in Iran in patients with PCOS shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily for 8-20 weeks does not improve glycemic indices, hormonal factors, lipid levels, or measures of body size (e.g., weight, waist circumference) when compared with placebo (116619) However, a clinical study, included in the above meta-analysis, shows that taking magnesium oxide orally, 250 mg daily for 10 weeks improves subjective measures of quality of life, fatigue, and emotional functioning, but not objective measures such as alopecia, abnormal uterine bleeding, or acne, when compared with placebo (108965).\n\nA clinical study using a combination of magnesium 250 mg with vitamin E 400 mg daily for 12 weeks shows a modest reduction in insulin resistance, insulin levels, and triglyceride levels, but not other lipid levels, when compared with placebo (100264). It is unclear if these beneficial effects are due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination.\nless\nSickle cell disease. Intravenous magnesium does not add any benefit to standard therapy for sickle cell disease in children.\nClinical research shows that giving magnesium sulfate 40-100 mg/kg (maximum of 2 grams per dose) intravenously every hour for 6-8 doses as an adjunct to standard therapy does not decrease hospital stay, pain, or opioid use, or improve quality of life, when compared with standard therapy and placebo in children with sickle cell disease (89399, 98283, 101356). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nless\nStillbirth. Magnesium administered during pregnancy does not reduce stillbirth risk.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium supplementation does not significantly decrease the risk of stillbirths when administered during pregnancy (60925, 60978).\nless\nTetanus. Intravenous magnesium sulfate does not seem to improve outcomes in patients with this condition.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo or diazepam in patients with tetanus (61020). While some research shows that magnesium reduces the duration of hospitalization and the need for ventilation when compared with diazepam (61170), magnesium does not seem to improve these outcomes when compared with placebo (60860).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Magnesium does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI. Its effect in patients with concussions is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that treatment with magnesium does not significantly improve neurological outcomes or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe TBI (60905). A small observational cohort study in adolescents with concussions has found that adding oral magnesium 400 mg twice daily for 5 days to standard treatment with acetaminophen and ondansetron is associated with a trend toward reduced symptom severity when compared with standard treatment alone (104401). The validity of this study is limited by its observational nature and small cohort size.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to help reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal but may reduce the duration of alcoholic delirium.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administration of four intramuscular injections of magnesium sulfate 2 grams at 6-hour intervals does not reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal when compared with saline (61063). A small observational study in patients with alcoholic delirium has found that administering magnesium sulfate IV 50 mg/kg every 8 hours, in addition to usual sedation, is associated with a reduction of delirium by approximately 2 days, or 4 days when given every 12 hours in addition to dexmedetomidine, when compared with usual sedation alone (111180). However, half of patients had hypomagnesemia at baseline; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal magnesium levels. Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nChildren with ADHD seem to have lower magnesium levels in their blood and hair (9969, 100262, 100263). A small clinical study in children aged 7-12 years with ADHD and magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium aspartate and lactate 6 mg/kg daily for 6 months might improve hyperactivity and magnesium levels when compared with control (1189). Another small clinical study in children with ADHD but without magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium 6 mg/kg daily along with vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks may modestly improve emotional problems, but not inattention or hyperactivity, as measured on the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), when compared with placebo (105914).\nless\nBack pain. It is unclear if oral or intravenous magnesium is beneficial for acute or chronic back pain in adults.\nOne open-label clinical study in adults with acute low-back pain shows that taking magnesium 365 mg once daily in addition to taking etodolac 400 mg twice daily for 10 days does not further reduce pain when compared with taking etodolac alone (105913). Magnesium has also been tried for chronic back pain. A small clinical study in patients with chronic low-back pain shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 1 gram in 250 mL normal saline intravenously every 4 hours for 2 weeks, followed by magnesium gluconate 100 mg and magnesium oxide 400 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks, reduces pain severity when compared with placebo (90035). It is unclear if oral magnesium used alone is beneficial.\nless\nBariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if oral magnesium supplementation improves metabolic parameters after bariatric surgery.\nA retrospective study of over 3000 post-bariatric surgery patients suggests that those who take oral magnesium supplements providing 100-450 mg elemental magnesium daily may have improved metabolic parameters over 4 years of follow-up. When patients taking magnesium supplements were compared with those not taking supplements, 11% and 18% had type 2 diabetes, respectively, 30% and 42% had hypertension, respectively, and 16% and 23% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, respectively. For patients with hypomagnesemia at baseline, supplementation seemed to result in greater benefits (108968).\nless\nBipolar disorder. Taking magnesium orally might improve manic symptoms in some people with bipolar disorder; however, it is unclear how it compares to current standard of care.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium 40 mEq daily (Magnesiocard) for 32 weeks has similar effects to lithium in up to 50% of patients treated for rapid cycling bipolar affective disorder (61022). Another preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium oxide 375 mg orally daily plus verapamil 80 mg taken four times daily reduces manic symptoms more effectively than verapamil alone in patients with mania (60742).\nless\nCancer-related neuropathic pain. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for this condition.\nSingle 500 mg to 1 gram doses of magnesium sulfate seem to relieve neuropathic pain for up to four hours when compared to baseline (6846). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCardiac arrest. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to be helpful in cardiac arrest; however, the risk of sudden cardiac death seems to be inversely correlated to higher plasma magnesium levels or dietary intake. It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is associated with similar risk reduction.\nAdministering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to improve successful resuscitation in people with cardiac arrest (1190). However, higher plasma magnesium levels and higher dietary magnesium intake might reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, possibly by protecting against fatal ventricular arrhythmias. In the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of sudden cardiac death was 77% lower in females with the highest quartile of plasma magnesium levels when compared with the lowest quartile. Also, the risk was 37% lower in females with the highest quartile of dietary magnesium intake when compared with the lowest quartile (17132).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence regarding the effect of dietary magnesium on CVD risk is conflicting.\nEpidemiological research in some populations shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with decreased mortality due to strokes, coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, but other epidemiological research does not show any effect on these risks (89391, 90003, 90009, 90030, 90036, 103735). Reasons for the discrepancies may be related to serum levels of magnesium at baseline, risk of cardiovascular disease at baseline, use of concomitant medications such as diuretics, or the presence of concomitant conditions such as kidney dysfunction.\n\nA population analysis conducted in Denmark has found that magnesium intake from drinking water may be associated with cardiovascular mortality. The overall risk of cardiovascular death and death due to stroke was reduced by 4% in the lowest 3 quintiles of intake when compared with the highest quintile. However, the risk of death due to acute myocardial infarction was increased by 22% in the lowest quintile when compared with the highest (108726). The relevance of these results is unclear, given that the main dietary source of magnesium is food rather than drinking water.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced leukopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in pediatric patients at risk for cisplatin-induced febrile neutropenia.\nA small clinical study in children with solid tumors aged 9 years and older shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily while receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy reduces febrile neutropenia by 47% and septic shock by 57% when compared with not receiving magnesium. Results from this study suggest that four pediatric patients need to take oral magnesium to avoid one case of febrile neutropenia (104394).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.\nA meta-analysis of several lower quality clinical studies in adults in Japan with cancer receiving cisplatin shows that pretreatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate 5 to 20 mEq reduces the odds of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner when compared to standard hydration therapy (115726). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including types of cancer, definitions of nephrotoxicity, and use of other nephroprotective therapies.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Limited evidence suggests that magnesium may help improve CFS symptoms, but this is controversial.\nIn people with low red blood cell magnesium, there is some evidence that intramuscular injections of 1 gram magnesium sulfate given once weekly for 6 weeks might improve CFS symptoms (7556). However, there is additional evidence that most patients with CFS have normal magnesium stores, and measurement of red cell magnesium is a poor indicator of total magnesium stores (7557, 8084, 8085, 8086, 8087).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intravenous, but not nebulized, magnesium may be helpful in acute exacerbations of COPD.\nAdministering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1.2-2.5 grams over 20 minutes, might be helpful for treating acute exacerbations of COPD (1208, 6844, 103733). Also, giving magnesium sulfate 2 grams intravenously seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo (89384). A meta-analysis of studies using intravenous magnesium sulfate for COPD exacerbations shows that it reduces hospital admission and mean length of stay and improves dyspnea scores when compared with placebo. Based on the relative risk identified in the included studies, seven patients would need to receive intravenous magnesium to prevent one hospitalization. However, intravenous magnesium sulfate does not change the need for non-invasive ventilation and the available research did not evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) admission (108967).\n\nNebulized magnesium has also been evaluated. In patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation, clinical research shows that administering nebulized magnesium sulfate with albuterol three times at 30-minute intervals does not improve pulmonary function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) when compared with placebo (89393). Also, a meta-analysis of a small number of low-quality studies shows that nebulized magnesium does not reduce hospital admission or the need for ventilatory support, although it might modestly improve dyspnea scores and reduce ICU admissions, when compared with placebo (108967).\nless\nCluster headache. It is unclear if a single intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate is beneficial for cluster headaches.\nAdministering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1 gram over 5 minutes, seems to improve cluster headaches when compared with baseline(1184). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for cognitive impairment.\nA large observational study in adults with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis suggests that serum magnesium levels of 20.2-22.3 mg/dL are associated with the lowest odds of mild cognitive impairment, while serum magnesium levels below and above that range of values are associated with increased odds of mild cognitive impairment (111695).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is beneficial for CHD.\nClinical research shows that magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily for 3 months reduces platelet-dependent thrombosis by 35% when compared with placebo in patients with CHD (60759). It is unclear if this effect improves clinical outcomes.\n\nThe effect of magnesium supplementation on coronary artery calcium has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in 196 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) shows that taking magnesium or increasing the concentration of magnesium in dialysate does not improve coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores when compared with standard therapy. However, magnesium reduced carotid intima-media thickness (111179). Similarly, a large clinical study in patients with CKD shows that taking slow-release magnesium hydroxide (Mablet, Denmark) 360 mg twice daily for 12 months does not slow the progression of CAC scores when compared with placebo (111178). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA small clinical study in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 shows that taking magnesium 300 mg daily for the duration of hospitalization reduces the number of patients requiring oxygen therapy but not the duration of hospital stay when compared with placebo (114680).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if magnesium is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of depression in adults.\nSome population research shows that dietary intake of elemental magnesium between 76-360 mg daily is associated with a reduced risk of depression, but there was no association with greater amounts of magnesium, and other population research shows no association at any intake level (96480, 98289). For treatment of mild to moderate depression, one preliminary clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride 2 grams orally daily for 6 weeks reduces depression scores by 56% and anxiety scores by about 52% when compared to baseline (96477). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. However, a small clinical study in adults with recurrent depression shows that taking magnesium aspartate 120 mg daily for 8 weeks, along with fluoxetine, does not improve depression scores when compared with patients taking fluoxetine and placebo (111185). Similarly, a very small crossover clinical study in adults with mild or moderate treatment-resistant depression shows that administering a single dose of IV magnesium sulfate 4 grams does not improve depression scores when compared with an infusion of 5% dextrose (96481). However, scores were evaluated 24 hours post-infusion which may be too soon to detect improvement.\n\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that elemental magnesium in doses of 100-400 mg is not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in patients with depression (110318).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg plus vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces ulcer size when compared with placebo (101436). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral or topical magnesium reduces muscle soreness in adults.\nA very small study in healthy adults, ages 19-23, shows that taking magnesium glycinate 350 mg daily for 10 days seems to reduce muscle soreness after bench press exercise when compared with placebo (104399).\n\nAdditionally, oral magnesium has been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in exercise-trained adults shows that taking magnesium citrate 420 mg combined with cannabidiol 70 mg, cannabigerol 50 mg, beta caryophyllene 25 mg, and branched-chain amino acids 3.8 grams twice daily for 3.5 days does not improve self-reported muscle soreness or functional aspects of recovery when compared with placebo (113050). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nTopical magnesium has also been evaluated for exercise-induced muscle soreness. A small clinical study in healthy adults aged 18-50 shows that applying magnesium gel 0.53mg/ml to the thigh muscle 10 minutes before and immediately after exercise did not reduce muscle soreness scores within 48 hours after a bout of downhill running when compared with placebo(117419). The validity of these results is limited by the low concentration of magnesium in the studied gel, and short study duration.\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate administration reduces the risk of fetal and premature infant mortality.\nTwo meta-analyses of up to 7 clinical studies in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that antenatal IV magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal death when compared with placebo (114675, 114681).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate administration reduces the risk of fetal and premature infant mortality.\nTwo meta-analyses of up to 7 clinical studies in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that antenatal IV magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal death when compared with placebo (114675, 114681).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for this condition.\nA small clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride orally 100 mg once daily for one month reduces mild to moderate, but not severe, stress associated with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo. It also reduces pain levels, but not to a clinically significant extent, and it does not affect sleep, fatigue, or quality of life (108964). Another small clinical study shows that taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves some symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as number of tender points and depression, when compared to baseline (89385). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nMagnesium has also been evaluated in combination therapy. A small clinical study shows that taking a combination of magnesium hydroxide and malic acid (Super Malic tablets) orally decreases fibromyalgia-related pain and tenderness in some patients when compared with placebo (3262). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, malic acid, or the combination. Additionally, a single-center, crossover clinical study in adults with fibromyalgia (primarily female patients) already receiving pharmacological therapy (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants) shows that taking a combination of magnesium 600 mg, coenzyme Q10, and tryptophan daily (Trimax 10, AS & NL) for 3 months does not improve self-reported fatigue when compared to baseline (116616).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for this condition.\nA small clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride orally 100 mg once daily for one month reduces mild to moderate, but not severe, stress associated with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo. It also reduces pain levels, but not to a clinically significant extent, and it does not affect sleep, fatigue, or quality of life (108964). Another small clinical study shows that taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves some symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as number of tender points and depression, when compared to baseline (89385). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nMagnesium has also been evaluated in combination therapy. A small clinical study shows that taking a combination of magnesium hydroxide and malic acid (Super Malic tablets) orally decreases fibromyalgia-related pain and tenderness in some patients when compared with placebo (3262). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, malic acid, or the combination. Additionally, a single-center, crossover clinical study in adults with fibromyalgia (primarily female patients) already receiving pharmacological therapy (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants) shows that taking a combination of magnesium 600 mg, coenzyme Q10, and tryptophan daily (Trimax 10, AS & NL) for 3 months does not improve self-reported fatigue when compared to baseline (116616).\nless\nFractures. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce fracture risk.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is associated with a 34% lower odds of fracture when compared with lower magnesium intake (101395).\nless\nGastric cancer. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce gastric cancer risk.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with a reduced risk for gastric cancer when compared with lower intake (103730).\nless\nHearing loss. Oral magnesium may prevent and improve hearing loss due to environmental factors or loud noises.\nClinical research in healthy military recruits shows that taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 2 months prevents hearing loss from exposure to loud noises during basic military training when compared with placebo (1205). Also, in patients with acute-onset hearing loss that was not caused by environmental factors, taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to improve hearing loss when compared with placebo (60813).\nless\nHypertension. Oral magnesium supplementation may modestly reduce blood pressure, although these changes are not likely to be considered clinically significant.\nMost research shows that taking oral magnesium supplements in daily doses that are at least as high as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults and up to 1000 mg daily can lower diastolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg in adults with or without hypertension (1192, 1199, 9465, 15165, 18111, 96482). Significantly lower doses do not seem to have this effect (1180, 1195, 1197, 8098). The effect of magnesium on systolic blood pressure is conflicting. Two meta-analyses shows that taking magnesium 212-970 mg daily does not lower systolic blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension (15165, 115728). However, additional meta-analyses show that taking magnesium 120-970 mg daily can lower systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner by about 2-4 mmHg in patients with or without hypertension (18111, 96482). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be due to heterogenous methods, including dose and duration among clinical studies. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that inconsistent and inconclusive evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure. Products bearing this claim must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium daily, but no more than 350 mg daily (107451).\nless\nHypokalemia. It is unclear if intravenous or oral magnesium is beneficial for hypokalemia in patients with normal magnesium levels.\nA preliminary retrospective observational study in patients with hypokalemia and unknown serum magnesium levels has found that administering oral or intravenous magnesium is not associated with improved time to normalization of serum potassium levels when compared with no magnesium treatment (110049). However, hypokalemia with concurrent hypomagnesemia can impede potassium repletion and exacerbate hypokalemia-induced rhythm disturbances. Standard of care in patients with hypokalemia and known hypomagnesemia includes prompt treatment with magnesium (110063).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels when compared with placebo. Taking magnesium also did not affect blood pressure, body weight, triglyceride levels, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, it did modestly improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (110053).\nless\nInsomnia. Oral magnesium may modestly improve sleep complaints in adults, but evidence is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in healthy older adults with or without insomnia suggests that taking magnesium reduces the time to fall asleep by an average of 17 minutes when compared with placebo (105917). However, it does not increase the time spent asleep. Also, these findings are limited by imprecision and a high risk of bias. Studies included in the analysis used elemental magnesium 500-729 mg daily (as magnesium oxide) for up to 8 weeks (102458, 105917). Another small clinical study in patients with poor sleep quality and low magnesium status shows that taking elemental magnesium 320 mg (as magnesium citrate) in divided doses daily for 7 weeks does not improve sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), when compared with a sodium citrate placebo (102456).\n\nMagnesium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small crossover clinical study in patients aged 18-40 years without a sleep disorder shows that taking a combination of magnesium 300 mg, L-tryptophan 1000 mg, glycine 3000 mg, tart cherry 220 mg, and theanine 200 mg for 3 days reduces the time to fall asleep by about 24 minutes, increases total time asleep by about 22 minutes, and improves sleep efficiency, but does not improve the total time in bed or wakefulness after falling asleep when compared with cellulose placebo (111184). Another small crossover clinical study in adults with sleep disturbances shows that taking a combination of magnesium 200 mg and melatonin nightly for 4 weeks improves sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, reduces the length of time it takes to fall asleep by about 17 minutes, and improves some other measures of sleep, such as sleep efficiency and number of awakenings, when compared with placebo. However, despite these improvements, overall sleep quality was still categorized as poor after the intervention (116160). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nIntraventricular hemorrhage. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in premature infants shows that if the mother received antenatal intravenous magnesium sulfate, the infant had a non-significant trend toward a reduced risk of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with infants whose mothers received placebo (103727). This analysis may have been insufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups. Another meta-analysis of up to 6 clinical studies, some of which are included in the previously referenced meta-analysis, in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that maternal antenatal (IV) magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, but does reduce the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by about 24% when compared with placebo (114681).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking magnesium orally may prevent the recurrence of kidney stones, although evidence is conflicting.\nProphylactic treatment with magnesium hydroxide, 200 mg twice daily for one year, followed by 500 mg daily for another year, might decrease the recurrence rate of calcium stone formation (2007). However, magnesium oxide does not seem to benefit patients considered to be recurrent calcium stone formers when compared with placebo, no treatment, or chlorthalidone (8097, 38501, 61199). Magnesium oxide 300 mg in combination with vitamin B6 10 mg daily seems to decrease urinary oxalate levels in people with hyperoxaluria who have previously had kidney stones (1201), but it is unclear if this effect translates into a reduced incidence of kidney stones.\nless\nLiver cancer. Increased dietary magnesium intake is linked with a lower risk of liver cancer.\nObservational research in retired older Americans has found that higher dietary magnesium intake is associated with a 35% lower risk of liver cancer when compared with lower intake. This association was especially strong in persons who were moderate or heavy alcohol users (105080).\nless\nLung cancer. Supplemental or dietary magnesium intake does not seem to reduce the risk of lung cancer.\nA large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests there is no association between dietary or supplemental magnesium intake and the risk of lung cancer. However, dietary magnesium seems to play an important yet unclear role in lung cancer prevention when taken as part of the diet with alpha-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, lycopene, selenium, lutein, and zeaxanthin (112096).\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral magnesium may help prevent migraine in some adults and children. Also, intravenous magnesium may help treat migraine in adults, but evidence is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 4 low-quality clinical studies, in adults with migraine shows that magnesium 122-600 mg daily for 4-16 weeks modestly reduces migraine frequency and severity when compared with placebo(115730). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these findings is limited by heterogeneous methods between clinical trials, including type of magnesium formulation and dose, patient population, and duration. In contrast, one small clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce migraine frequency and severity by at least 50% in adults when compared with placebo (10661).\n\nLimited evidence suggests that adding oral magnesium to conventional treatment may also be beneficial. A clinical study in adults with migraine living in Iran shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg twice daily in addition to sodium valproate 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces severity and duration of migraine, but not migraine frequency, when compared with taking sodium valproate alone (105915). It is unclear if these improvements would be considered clinically significant.\n\nFor treatment of migraine, some adults with normal magnesium levels respond to intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate 1 gram over 5 minutes, but most patients who benefit have low magnesium levels at baseline (1185, 6844). Effects of IV magnesium in patients with unknown magnesium levels are conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that magnesium 1-2 grams IV alleviates acute migraine for up to 2 hours, but other research has found no benefit (89388, 97493, 98285).\n\nIn children, treatment with magnesium oxide orally 15 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for up to 16 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of migraine headaches when compared with placebo (10663). However, adding magnesium sulfate 400 mg orally daily to ibuprofen or acetaminophen does not further reduce migraine severity in children (89396).\nless\nMiscarriage. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing magnesium 450 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, hyaluronic acidvitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone (113893). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo in the control group.\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Research on the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium after myocardial infarction are conflicting.\nAdministering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to reduce mortality after an acute MI (8999, 13357, 13358, 13359, 13360, 19990, 60872, 61082), although there is some conflicting evidence from a meta-analysis of clinical research that shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce short-term mortality by 55% when compared with placebo (60795, 60895). Clinical research with oral magnesium supplementation has found no benefit (1198, 6844).\nless\nNeonatal encephalopathy. Intravenous magnesium may improve short-term outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium may improve short term outcomes of neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, HIE). However, long term outcomes are not affected (90025).\nless\nNocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium is helpful for nocturnal leg cramps.\nSome clinical research in adults with nocturnal leg cramps shows that taking magnesium oxide 865 mg daily at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce the frequency of leg cramping episodes when compared with placebo (96478). However, four weeks may be too short a time to see a benefit. In other clinical research, taking oral magnesium oxide monohydrate 226mg daily at bedtime for 60 days reduces the frequency of leg cramps when compared with placebo. This reduction was not seen after 30 days. Magnesium also reduced cramp duration and improved sleep quality, but did not affect pain scores, at 60 days when compared with placebo (106919).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral magnesium hydroxide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking magnesium hydroxide 150 mg and L-carnitine 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve liver stiffness scores when compared with baseline or controls who took placebo for 8 weeks followed by this magnesium and L- carnitine combination for 8 weeks. Taking magnesium and L-carnitine also did not improve levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) when compared to baseline (111177).\nless\nObesity. Evidence on the use of magnesium for weight loss in obese patients is conflicting; any benefit is likely small at best.\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies in obese patients shows that taking magnesium reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.3 when compared with control (103723). Another meta-analysis of 7 studies in obese patients shows that while magnesium supplementation does not reduce weight, it reduces waist circumference by 2 cm when compared with placebo (103729). Interestingly, subgroup analyses did not find that the dose of magnesium or baseline magnesium levels impacted effectiveness. One subgroup analysis found that magnesium supplementation lasting 12 weeks or less seemed to be more beneficial for obesity than supplementation lasting longer than 12 weeks (103723).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Population research has not found a link between magnesium intake and osteoarthritis risk.\nObservational research has found that dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with the risk of developing osteoarthritis (101395).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral or IV magnesium reduces the risk of overall mortality.\nA meta-analysis of heterogeneous observational studies has found that increased dietary magnesium intake, but not supplemental magnesium intake, is associated with a modestly reduced risk of overall mortality (105073). A meta-analysis of 3 small, low-quality clinical studies in ICU patients shows that administering IV magnesium 24-30 mmol or as a target-directed dose for 3 days reduces overall mortality when compared with patients who did not receive magnesium (111290). However, some studies included patients with hypomagnesemia; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal levels of magnesium.\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if locally injected or intravenous magnesium is helpful for acute pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with renal colic shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes, is as effective as IV morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg for controlling acute renal pain at 20 minutes after the dose (107367).\n\nMagnesium has also been evaluated in a dental procedure. A single-center clinical study in India in adults with irreversible pulpitis requiring a root canal shows that a local injection of 0.2 mL of 10% magnesium sulfate with lidocaine and epinephrine reduces perioperative pain when compared to lidocaine with epinephrine alone (115729).\nless\nPain (chronic). Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may modestly reduce the risk for chronic pain.\nA cross-sectional observational study has found that increased magnesium intake is associated with a 7% to 8% reduced risk for chronic pain. The association was found to be stronger in females than in males (103732).\nless\nParturition. It is unclear if topical magnesium is beneficial for labor duration.\nA single-center clinical study in Iranian adults shows that applying 10 mL of a 50% magnesium sulfate solution directly to the cervix during the active phase of labor reduces the time to vaginal delivery by approximately 1.5 hours and improves the childbirth experience, as reported by patients, when compared with placebo. However, clinical significance is unclear (115727).\nless\nPerioperative anxiety. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for perioperative anxiety.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves anxiety and depression scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery (110054).\nless\nPhysical performance. Oral magnesium may modestly improve physical performance in otherwise healthy, elderly females.\nClinical research in otherwise healthy elderly females shows that taking a magnesium oxide supplement (Easymag, Sanofi-Aventis) 900 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves walking speed and chair stand speed in elderly females when compared with no treatment (90026).\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for PONV due to mixed results from clinical research.\nA meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate intraoperatively reduces PONV (114676). However, a meta-analysis of 20 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium perioperatively does not reduce the incidence of PONV (114678). A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative vomiting but not postoperative nausea when compared with control (113677). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for postoperative recovery.\nA moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce extubation time, time spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), or duration of hospital stay when compared with control (113677). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 different clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium intraoperatively does not reduce extubation time (114676).\nless\nPostoperative sleep disturbance. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative sleep disturbances.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves sleep scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery (110054).\nless\nPostoperative sore throat. It is unclear if topical magnesium sulfate is beneficial for preventing or treating sore throat pain after endotracheal intubation.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation for surgery shows that using a gargle containing magnesium sulfate 20% with lidocaine, 20 minutes before anesthesia induction, is less effective for reducing sore throat pain than a gargle containing dexmedetomidine and lidocaine (112779). The study did not include a comparison to lidocaine alone.\n\nDifferent preparations of magnesium have also been compared. A single-center clinical study in China in adults undergoing endotracheal intubation for elective surgery shows that applying a magnesium sulfate spray 15 mg/kg during intubation onto the pharyngeal area is non-inferior to a magnesium sulfate gargle 20 mg/kg used for 30 seconds 15 minutes prior to surgery in reducing the incidence of postoperative sore throat within 48 hours (116618).\nless\nPregnancy-related leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium reduces leg cramps during pregnancy; evidence is conflicting.\nOne small clinical study in patients with pregnancy-related leg cramps shows that taking magnesium bisglycinate chelate 300 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and intensity of leg cramps when compared with placebo (99318). A smaller clinical study in this population shows that taking a specific mixture of magnesium lactate and citrate (Nycoplus Magnesium) providing elemental magnesium 120 mg in the morning and 240 mg in the evening for 3 weeks reduces the frequency of cramps when compared with placebo (1194). However, not all research agrees. One small clinical study using this same supplement and dose for 2 weeks found no benefit when compared with placebo (17463). It is possible that a 2-week duration of treatment is too short to be beneficial. Finally, a meta-analysis of these studies and one other more recent clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce the frequency or improve the resolution of pregnancy-related leg cramps when compared with placebo (105916). This analysis may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between treatment groups.\nless\nPre-procedural sedation. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial when administered in addition to other medications used for sedation during surgery.\nA moderate-sized study of adults aged 65-79 years old undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows that administering a single intravenous bolus of magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to the procedure reduces intraoperative propofol requirements by about 21% and reduces some peri-procedural adverse events including the incidence of respiratory depression and involuntary movement when compared with control. However, there were no differences in recovery time, hemodynamic parameters, or the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, perioperative nausea or vomiting, lethargy, or arrythmias (111694). Another moderate-sized study in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce the need for medications used for anesthesia induction, intraoperative maintenance propofol requirements, or recovery time when compared with control. However, magnesium sulfate does seem to reduce the amount of remifentanil required for intraoperative anesthesia maintenance and increase norepinephrine requirements when compared with control (113677).\nless\nPreterm labor. The use of magnesium sulfate to inhibit uterine contractions in preterm labor (tocolysis) is controversial. However, its use for the purpose of fetal neuroprotection for up to 48 hours is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.\nMagnesium is given intravenously (IV) during preterm labor in an effort to improve fetal neurological outcomes, such as to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy and motor dysfunction in the infant (60915, 60927, 60931, 61001, 97485, 103734, 103754, 114681). The typical dosage of magnesium sulfate is 4 grams infused IV over 10-30 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 1-4 grams/hour for 48 hours or until birth. Use beyond 5-7 days has been associated with hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the fetus (15, 12590, 12594). Some meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that magnesium sulfate is more effective at delaying delivery by 48 hours when compared with oxytocin receptor blockers, nitrates, beta-mimetics, and/or placebo (20263, 61021). However, an additional meta-analysis of several clinical studies shows that magnesium sulfate 4 or 6 grams IV is not more effective at delaying preterm labor by 48 hours when compared with nifedipine (115639). The reason for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may be related to the heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including dose and duration.\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for RLS.\nSome observational research has found that hypomagnesemia is associated with RLS; however, not all research agrees (8096, 9472). Preliminary clinical research in adults with RLS who are beginning treatment with pramipexole shows that also taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 2 months moderately improves RLS scores and sleep quality scores when compared with pramipexole and placebo (110052). Other low-quality clinical research in adults with RLS or periodic limb movement during sleep shows that taking magnesium 12.4 mmol orally in the evening for 4-6 weeks decreases movement and increases sleep when compared with baseline (9466). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of sarcopenia.\nPopulation research in older adults has found that lower dietary intake of magnesium is associated with sarcopenia. However, the effect of magnesium supplementation on sarcopenia prevention or treatment has not been evaluated (110055).\n\nMagnesium has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for treatment of sarcopenia. A small clinical study in elderly individuals with sarcopenia undergoing a diet and exercise program shows that taking a combination supplement containing magnesium 300 mg, carnosine, hydroxymethylbutyrate, lactoferrin, and sodium butyrate daily for 4 months increases muscle mass, as measured by the skeletal muscle index, and improves measures of muscle function, including handgrip muscle strength, chair test, and walking speed, when compared with placebo (114682). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for sepsis.\nA very large observational study in patients with sepsis and hypomagnesaemia or normomagnesemia in the intensive care unit (ICU) suggests that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 2 or 4 grams within 24 hours of admission reduces 28-day all-cause mortality from 25% in patients who did not use magnesium sulfate to 20% in those who were administered magnesium sulfate, regardless of baseline serum magnesium level and other baseline characteristics. Administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate in this population may also reduce ICU mortality by 4%, in-hospital mortality by 3%, and the use of renal replacement therapy by 3% but also seems to increase the length of ICU and hospital stay when compared with patients who did not use magnesium sulfate (113676). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study.\nless\nSleep deprivation. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of magnesium 1350 mg, zinc 90 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg for 3 nights at bedtime does not change sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue the next day when compared with placebo (113655).\nless\nStroke. Increased dietary magnesium may decrease stroke risk, and using a magnesium-containing salt substitute may improve neurological performance post-stroke. However, intravenous magnesium has not demonstrated benefit.\nMost population research has found that increased dietary intake of magnesium is associated with decreased stroke risk and decreased mortality from stroke (9001, 9002, 90013, 90030, 90036, 92107, 103736). In patients who have had a stroke, a preliminary clinical study shows that using a salt substitute providing the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of magnesium and potassium for 6 months improves neurological performance when compared with using regular salt (97491).\n\nHowever, intravenous (IV) magnesium does not seem to be beneficial in patients who have had a stroke. Large prospective clinical trials show that IV magnesium given within 12 hours of acute stroke does not reduce mortality or disability in most patients when compared with placebo. However, one subgroup analysis suggested that IV magnesium might benefit patients with lacunar (non-cortical) stroke (13361, 90021). IV magnesium also doesn't seem to reduce cardiovascular complications after acute stroke. A secondary analysis of a clinical trial in patients after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke shows that giving IV magnesium does not reduce serious cardiac adverse events when compared with placebo (104393). Another secondary analysis of this trial shows that giving IV magnesium prior to arrival at the hospital and within 2 hours of a hemorrhagic stroke does not reduce hematoma volume on hospital arrival, hematoma expansion during hospital admission, or functional outcomes at 3 months (108733).\nless\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in people with subarachnoid hemorrhage, but evidence is conflicting.\nThere is mixed evidence regarding the effect of magnesium sulfate in managing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate 64-144 mmol/day for 10-18 days reduces the risk of poor outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, including death, vegetative state, or dependency, by 46% when compared with control (60932). Also, meta-analyses of clinical research show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia by 27% when compared with placebo (60944, 89398). However, these results were not confirmed in other meta-analyses (60973, 90034).\nless\nThrombocytopenia. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium sulfate is beneficial in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).\nAddition of intravenous magnesium sulfate as a 6-gram loading dose followed by 6 grams infused over 24 hours for 3 days, to standard treatment for TTP does not reduce the time to normalization of the platelet count, the incidence of TTP-related organ dysfunction, or the recurrence rate, when compared with standard treatment alone (112777). This study may have been underpowered to detect a difference.\nless\nUrinary incontinence. Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for urinary incontinence, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose.\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for PXE.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with PXE shows that taking magnesium oxide 800 mg (500 mg of elemental magnesium) twice daily for one year tends to reduce calcification of elastic skin fibers when compared with placebo, but the effect is not statistically significant (101393). This study was limited by small size and insufficient power to detect smaller effects.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate magnesium for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: For preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For males: 400 mg for ages 19-30 years, 420 mg for ages 31 years and older. For females: 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 320 mg for ages 31 years and older. For pregnant females: 400 mg for ages 14-18 years, 350 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 360 mg for ages 31-50 years. For lactating females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years, 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, 320 mg for ages 31-50 years (7555).\n\nTherapeutic doses of magnesium vary widely. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous / Intramuscular:Magnesium sulfate is typically used intravenously, short-term for acute management of symptoms. Typical loading doses range from 4-14 grams IV, and can be followed by 2.5-5 grams every 4 hours IM, or a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-3 grams/hour.\nChildren\nOral:\nFor preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For all children: 80 mg for ages 1-3 years, 130 mg for ages 4-8 years, 240 mg for ages 9-13 years. For males: 410 mg for ages 14-18 years. For females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years. For pregnant females age 14-18 years, 400 mg; for lactating females age 14-18 years, 360 mg.\n\nFor infants 0-6 months of age, the adequate intake (AI) level is 30 mg. For infants 7-12 months of age, the AI is 75 mg.\n\nFor therapeutic uses, research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMagnesium supplements used varied in composition, by the particular salt used in the formulation (aspartate, oxide, pidolate, and orotate) or by other confounding ingredients (multi-vitamin as magnesium source) (60751). Other salts of magnesium include citrate, chloride, lactate citrate, and gluconate.\n\nSupplement manufacturers of magnesium/calcium combination products promote a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio as being ideal for absorption of these elements. However, there is no credible research to support this claim. Products such as coral calcium that claim to have ideal combinations of magnesium and calcium to cure a variety of diseases and conditions have come under scrutiny of the FDA and FTC (12508).",

This is most likely to occur with high doses of magnesium given intravenously (13362).\nless\nANTACIDS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nUse of acid reducers may reduce the laxative effect of magnesium oxide.\nA retrospective analysis shows that, in the presence of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a higher dose of magnesium oxide is needed for a laxative effect (90033). This may also occur with antacids. Under acidic conditions, magnesium oxide is converted to magnesium chloride and then to magnesium bicarbonate, which has an osmotic laxative effect. By reducing acidity, antacids may reduce the conversion of magnesium oxide to the active bicarbonate salt.\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, magnesium may have antiplatelet effects, but the evidence is conflicting.\nIn vitro evidence shows that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation, even at low concentrations (20304, 20305). Some preliminary clinical evidence shows that infusion of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity (20306). However, other clinical research shows that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis can occur (60759).\nless\nBICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nMagnesium might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption.\nAdvise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium containing products (116930).\nless\nBISPHOSPHONATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nMagnesium can decrease absorption of bisphosphonates.\nCations, including magnesium, can decrease bisphosphonate absorption.

Severe hypotension and neuromuscular blockades may occur when nifedipine is used with intravenous magnesium (3046, 20264, 20265, 20266), although some contradictory evidence suggests that concurrent use of magnesium with nifedipine does not increase the risk of neuromuscular weakness (60831). High doses of magnesium could theoretically have additive effects with other calcium channel blockers.\nless\nDIGOXIN\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nMagnesium salts may reduce absorption of digoxin.\nClinical evidence suggests that treatment with oral magnesium hydroxide or magnesium trisilicate reduces absorption of digoxin from the intestines (198, 20268, 20270). This may reduce the blood levels of digoxin and decrease its therapeutic effects.\nless\nGABAPENTIN (Neurontin)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGabapentin absorption can be decreased by magnesium.\nClinical research shows that giving magnesium oxide orally along with gabapentin decreases the maximum plasma concentration of gabapentin by 33%, time to maximum concentration by 36%, and area under the curve by 43% (90032). Advise patients to take gabapentin at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements.\nless\nKETAMINE (Ketalar)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nMagnesium might precipitate ketamine toxicity.\nIn one case report, a 62-year-old hospice patient with terminal cancer who had been stabilized on sublingual ketamine 150 mg four times daily experienced severe ketamine toxicity lasting for 2 hours after taking a maintenance dose of ketamine following an infusion of magnesium sulfate 2 grams (105078). Since both magnesium and ketamine block the NMDA receptor, magnesium is thought to have potentiated the effects of ketamine.\nless\nLEVODOPA/CARBIDOPA (Sinemet)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nMagnesium can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa.\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking magnesium oxide 1000 mg with levodopa 100 mg/carbidopa 10 mg reduces the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by 35% and of carbidopa by 81%. In vitro and animal research shows that magnesium produces an alkaline environment in the digestive tract, which might lead to degradation and reduced bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa (100265).\nless\nPOTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nPotassium-sparing diuretics decrease excretion of magnesium, possibly increasing magnesium levels.\nPotassium-sparing diuretics also have magnesium-sparing properties, which can counteract the magnesium losses associated with loop and thiazide diuretics (9613, 9614, 9622). Theoretically, increased magnesium levels could result from concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics and magnesium supplements.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nMagnesium decreases absorption of quinolones.\nMagnesium can form insoluble complexes with quinolones and decrease their absorption (3046).

The mechanism of this interaction remains unclear (96486).\nless\nSKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review))\nParenteral magnesium alters the pharmacokinetics of skeletal muscle relaxants, increasing their effects and accelerating the onset of effect.\nParenteral magnesium shortens the time to onset of skeletal muscle relaxants by about 1 minute and prolongs the duration of action by about 2 minutes. Magnesium potentiates the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants by decreasing calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals, reducing postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine, and having a direct effect on the membrane potential of myocytes (3046, 97492, 107364). Magnesium also has vasodilatory actions and increases cardiac output, allowing a greater amount of muscle relaxant to reach the motor end plate (107364). A clinical study found that low-dose rocuronium (0.45 mg/kg), when given after administration of magnesium 30 mg/kg over 10 minutes, has an accelerated onset of effect, which matches the onset of effect seen with a full-dose rocuronium regimen (0.6 mg/kg) (96485). In another clinical study, onset times for rocuronium doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg were 86, 76, and 50 seconds, respectively, when given alone, but were reduced to 66, 44, and 38 seconds, respectively, when the doses were given after a 15-minute infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg/kg (107364). Giving intraoperative intravenous magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg/hour, reduces the onset time of rocuronium, enhances its clinical effects, reduces the dose of intraoperative opiates, and prolongs the spontaneous recovery time (112781, 112782). It does not affect the activity of subsequently administered neostigmine (112782).\nless\nSULFONYLUREAS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nMagnesium increases the systemic absorption of sulfonylureas, increasing their effects and side effects.\nClinical research shows that administration of magnesium hydroxide with glyburide increases glyburide absorption, increases maximal insulin response by 35-fold, and increases the risk of hypoglycemia, when compared with glyburide alone (20307). A similar interaction occurs between magnesium hydroxide and glipizide (20308). The mechanism of this effect appears to be related to the elevation of gastrointestinal pH by magnesium-based antacids, increasing solubility and enhancing absorption of sulfonylureas (22364).\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nMagnesium decreases absorption of tetracyclines.\nMagnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines in the gut and decrease their absorption and antibacterial activity (12586).

Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusion of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity (20306). However, other clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis can occur (60759). Theoretically, concomitant use of magnesium with other herbs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation might increase the risk of bleeding. See other products with antiplatelet activity here.\nless\nBORON\nBoron may reduce urinary excretion of magnesium in some people.\nBoron supplements can reduce urinary excretion of magnesium and increase serum levels in females (940, 9529, 9623). In young females, the effect appears to be greater in those that are sedentary than in those that are physically active (940). In postmenopausal adults, the effect is more marked in those with low dietary magnesium intake (9623). The clinical significance of these effects, and whether they occur in males, is unknown.\nless\nCALCIUM\nHigh doses of calcium can decrease dietary magnesium absorption.\nCalcium supplements can decrease the absorption of dietary magnesium, but only at very high, supra-therapeutic doses (2600 mg daily). In people with adequate magnesium stores, calcium doesn't have any clinically significant effect on long-term magnesium balance. Advise patients at high risk for magnesium deficiency to take calcium supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting dietary magnesium absorption (4623, 7555, 11159). Magnesium does not seem to affect calcium absorption (12587).\nless\nVITAMIN D\nHigh doses of some forms of vitamin D can increase magnesium absorption.\nOne intestinal route of magnesium absorption is thought to be vitamin D-dependent (9634). Various forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol, 25-hydroxyergocalciferol, calcifediol, and calcitriol increase magnesium absorption, especially when taken in high doses (9634, 9635, 9636, 9637). This effect has been used to treat hypomagnesemia in people with malabsorption syndromes (9516, 9635, 9636).\nless\nZINC\nHigh doses of zinc may decrease magnesium absorption.\nSupplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg daily, appears to decrease magnesium absorption and magnesium balance in healthy adult males (9624). Also, moderately high dietary zinc intake, 53 mg daily, seems to increase magnesium excretion without affecting copper metabolism in postmenopausal patients. This might adversely affect bone health. Zinc may compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine (12424).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nALCOHOL USE DISORDER\nChronic alcohol use increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. Alcohol impairs the ability of the kidney to conserve magnesium (12507).\nless\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\nIn vitro evidence suggests that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation even at low concentrations. Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusions of magnesium sulfate increase bleeding time by 48% and reduce platelet activity (20304, 20305, 20306). However, other clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis can occur (60759). Theoretically, magnesium might increase the chance of bleeding in patients with existing bleeding disorders.\nless\nDIABETES\nDiabetes increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. Poorly controlled diabetes leading to glycosuria leads to reduced renal reabsorption of magnesium (12507).\nless\nHEART BLOCK\nHypermagnesemia can cause heart block. Intravenous magnesium is contraindicated in people with heart block (13358).\nless\nKIDNEY DISEASE\nKidney disease reduces magnesium excretion and increases the risk for hypermagnesemia. Use cautiously in individuals with reduced kidney function and avoid use in those with creatinine clearance <20 mL/min due to an increased risk of hypermagnesemia (12507, 112859).\nless\nMYASTHENIA GRAVIS\nIntravenous magnesium might worsen neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure in patients with myasthenia gravis and contribute to a myasthenic crisis. Magnesium competes with calcium on the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, inhibiting release of acetylcholine (ACh) and exacerbating the reduction in postsynaptic ACh function seen in myasthenia gravis (108969). In one case report, a 62-year-old female with myasthenia gravis and metastatic thymoma had a worsening of respiratory failure and neuromuscular weakness after receiving intravenous magnesium (98292). In a second case report, a female with a known history of myasthenia gravis developed respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support on 3 separate occasions after receiving single doses of intravenous magnesium for cardiac arrhythmias (108969).\nless",

There isn't any increase in urinary magnesium, and serum levels normalize a few days after the drug is stopped (8874).\nless\nAMIFOSTINE (Ethyol)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nAmifostine increases urinary losses of magnesium.\nAmifostine reduces serum magnesium levels by reducing renal tubular reabsorption of magnesium and increasing urinary losses (9625). This effect seems to occur acutely after a single dose, and levels may return to normal within 24 hours (9625).\nless\nAMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nIncreased urinary magnesium loss occurs with nephrotoxicity caused by aminoglycosides.\nNephrotoxicity caused by aminoglycosides may lead to increased urinary losses of various electrolytes, including magnesium. Monitor patients closely to detect declining renal function and electrolyte disturbances. The aminoglycoside may need to be discontinued and intravenous electrolyte replacement given (13362).\nless\nAMPHOTERICIN-B (Abelcet, others)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nAmphotericin-B can cause a significant decrease in magnesium levels.\nElectrolyte disturbances, including low serum magnesium levels, develop in a large proportion of patients receiving amphotericin-B. Lipid-based formulations might have a lesser effect than the conventional formulations (13364). This disturbance has been association with nephrotoxicity, and may necessitate stopping the drug and giving intravenous electrolyte replacement.\nless\nBETA-2 AGONISTS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nBeta-2 agonists cause small, generally reversible decreases in magnesium levels.\nBeta-2 agonists promote movement of magnesium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, and increase magnesium excretion in the urine (2644, 9517, 9641). Reduced serum magnesium levels occur after a single dose of albuterol or terbutaline orally, by IV infusion, SC injection, or by inhalation (2644, 6203, 6205, 6209, 6217, 8882, 9517). The reductions are generally small, about 4.5-9%, or 0.04 to 0.06 mmol/L compared with the normal serum magnesium range of 0.65 to 1.1 mmol/L (6205, 6217). However, these acute changes could contribute to ECG changes, including prolonged QT intervals (2644, 8882). With chronic use of beta-2 agonists, serum magnesium levels generally return to normal, but muscle magnesium levels may remain low (6209, 6210, 9507). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nCAPECITABINE (Xeloda)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCapecitabine may damage renal tubules and increase magnesium losses.\nA case of hypomagnesemia, characterized by weakness and dizziness, has been reported in a patient treated with capecitabine 2 months earlier. Capecitabine may cause magnesium wasting due to its effects on the renal tubules (90019). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nCETUXIMAB (Erbitux)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCetuximab causes increased loss of magnesium in the urine.\nCetuximab causes renal magnesium wasting, leading to lowered magnesium levels in 50% to 97% of patients (15541). Hypomagnesemia severe enough to require treatment occurs in 10% to 15% of cases (15542). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nCHOLESTYRAMINE (Questran)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nSmall clinical studies show that cholestyramine may slightly increase urinary magnesium excretion, possibly by binding vitamin D and leading to reduced magnesium absorption (9566, 9627). Clinically significant magnesium deficiency hasn't been reported, and supplements aren't likely to be needed. For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking corticosteroids chronically increases excretion of magnesium in the urine.\nChronic use of corticosteroids increases the amount of magnesium excreted in the urine. This is thought to be due to catabolism of bone, releasing magnesium and increasing the amount available for excretion (9628, 9629). Generally, there is not a significant effect on serum levels (9507, 9508, 9509). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nCYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCyclosporine can increase magnesium loss in the urine, possibly by causing damage to the renal tubules.\nCyclosporine can cause significant loss of magnesium in the urine, probably by causing renal tubular damage which reduces tubular reabsorption (9117, 9632, 9633). Hypomagnesemia may contribute to seizures and neurotoxicity associated with cyclosporine (9117, 9632).\nless\nDIGOXIN (Lanoxin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nDigoxin increases excretion of magnesium in the urine.\nDigoxin decreases renal tubular reabsorption of magnesium, increasing excretion in the urine (4556, 9631). People taking digoxin for heart failure may also be taking loop or thiazide diuretics, increasing the potential for hypomagnesemia (9613, 9631). Low magnesium levels increase the risk of arrhythmias associated with high digoxin levels (9631, 90018). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nSome diuretics increase the amount of magnesium excreted in the urine.\nLoop diuretics and, to a lesser extent thiazide diuretics, interfere with magnesium reabsorption in the kidneys, increasing urinary losses and reducing serum magnesium levels (4412, 9613, 9614, 9622). Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone, are also magnesium-sparing, and can therefore counteract the magnesium losses seen with loop diuretics and thiazides (9613, 9614, 9622). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nESTROGENS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nEstrogens reduce serum levels of magnesium by increasing its uptake into body tissues.\nEstrogens enhance magnesium uptake by soft tissues and bones, lowering serum levels (9621, 9639). There appears to be an inverse relationship between estrogen levels and magnesium serum levels (9638, 9639, 9640). Estrogen therapy, including the use of oral contraceptives, lowers serum magnesium levels and can cause hypomagnesemia, which may contribute to thromboembolic complications associated with estrogens (9621, 9639, 9640). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nFOSCARNET (Foscavir)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nFoscarnet can increase removal of magnesium from the body, causing symptomatic hypomagnesemia.\nFoscarnet can cause various electrolyte disturbances, including symptomatic hypomagnesemia (8869, 9617). This may be due to chelation of magnesium and increased elimination (8869). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nINSULIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nInsulin can increase magnesium excretion.\nInsulin can enhance the renal excretion of magnesium. Theoretically, it might lower magnesium stores; however, lower magnesium stores are common in patients with diabetes due to decreased intake and osmotic diuresis resulting in increased magnesium excretion (13381). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nPANITUMUMAB (Vectibix)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPanitumumab increases excretion of magnesium in the urine.\nPanitumumab causes renal magnesium wasting, leading to lowered magnesium levels in 39% of patients. Hypomagnesemia severe enough to require treatment occurs in 2% to 4% of cases (15543). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPenicillamine can reduce magnesium absorption by chelating magnesium in the gut.\nPenicillamine chelates magnesium, although with lower affinity than other metals such as copper, iron, and zinc (9630). It can potentially contribute to hypomagnesemia, especially in people with other factors which lower serum magnesium (4534). Magnesium supplements should be taken several hours apart from penicillamine to avoid forming non-absorbable chelates in the gut. For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nPENTAMIDINE (NebuPent)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nPentamidine can increase magnesium loss in the urine, probably by causing damage to the renal tubules.\nSymptomatic hypomagnesemia can occur with pentamidine, especially when given intravenously. This is likely due to renal tubular injury, leading to increased urinary losses of magnesium. Hypomagnesemia usually requires treatment with intravenous, followed by oral, magnesium supplements. Supplementation may need to be continued after pentamidine is stopped since the drug effects remain for six to eight weeks (8872, 9618, 9619).\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nHypomagnesemia requiring supplementation has been reported with all PPIs.\nTaking a PPI long-term, especially over a year, has been linked to an increased risk of hypomagnesemia in observational research (17546, 17547, 17548, 17549, 17550, 17551, 17552, 17553, 17554, 17555, 17556, 89392, 90007, 100266, 101394, 107368, 110050). Higher doses are associated with a two-fold increase in the odds of hypomagnesemia when compared with lower doses (101394). Observational research in elderly hospitalized patients has also found that males, smokers, and heavy alcohol use further increase the risk of hypomagnesemia from PPI use (110050). PPIs increase intestinal pH which is thought to inhibit active transport of magnesium in the intestine, reducing its absorption (17549, 17550, 107368). The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) does not provide a recommendation related to monitoring magnesium levels in patients taking PPIs (107368). However, other experts, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommend that serum magnesium levels should be checked at baseline and annually thereafter in patients who are likely to take a PPI long-term. In up to 25% of patients who develop hypomagnesemia, the PPI will need to be discontinued permanently to return magnesium levels to normal and maintain them (17546, 17547, 17548, 17558). In some patients, it is possible to continue the PPI and take a magnesium supplement concurrently to maintain magnesium levels (17547, 17558). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nQuinolone antibiotics bind magnesium in the gut, reducing absorption of both agents.\nQuinolones form complexes with magnesium in the GI tract (3046). This could theoretically reduce absorption of both the quinolone and magnesium if taken at the same time. Significant effects on magnesium levels are unlikely when quinolones are taken at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements.\nless\nSODIUM PHOSPHATES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHigh doses of sodium phosphates deplete magnesium.\nUse of high doses of sodium phosphates, such as those used for bowel cleansing before surgery, can cause hypomagnesemia (9615, 9616). Advise people to avoid using high doses of these products for self-treatment of constipation.\nless\nTACROLIMUS (Prograf)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nTacrolimus increases magnesium losses in the urine.\nTacrolimus reduces renal tubular reabsorption of magnesium, producing increased magnesium wasting (8900, 9620). This leads to hypomagnesemia in a significant proportion of people treated with tacrolimus (9620). For information on foods that are rich in magnesium, see our chart.\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTetracyclines may bind to dietary magnesium, reducing absorption of both agents.\nTetracyclines form complexes with magnesium in the GI tract, which could reduce absorption of both the tetracycline and magnesium (4412). Significant effects on magnesium levels are unlikely when tetracyclines are taken on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after magnesium supplements.\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nSymptoms of magnesium toxicity include thirst, hypotension, central nervous system depression, drowsiness, confusion, skeletal muscle paralysis, loss of tendon reflexes, respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and, in extreme cases, coma, cardiac arrest, and death (8095, 12589). Serum magnesium levels should be monitored. Renal insufficiency increases the likelihood of toxicity due to hypermagnesemia (61013).\n\nThere are at least two reports of fatal hypermagnesemia. One report involved a 28-month-old child treated with 800 mg of oral magnesium oxide per day for constipation, then given 2400 mg magnesium oxide for several days before hospital admission (serum magnesium 20.3 mg/dL) (1360). Another report involved a patient who gargled with Epsom salts over several weeks. Epsom salts are almost 100% magnesium sulfate. The patient used an entire box two days prior to hospital admission (serum magnesium 23.6 mg/dL) (8095).\nTreatment\nManagement of hypermagnesemia is well-established; details can be found in various medical guidelines.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMagnesium requires both parathyroid hormone and vitamin D for absorption (12585). It is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and about one third of dietary magnesium is absorbed. The efficiency of absorption depends on magnesium stores in the body. Average absorption of supplements is 38%, but varies from 65% in people with low magnesium stores to 11% in those with high magnesium stores. Magnesium plasma concentrations peak at 4 hours after a dose (9634, 12585, 13383, 61054).\n\nEnteric coating of some products may reduce the absorption of magnesium (12587, 13383). It is well absorbed from foods (12587). Fractional magnesium absorption decreases with increasing intake. The bioavailability of magnesium supplements varies. Magnesium chloride (Slo-Mag), magnesium lactate (Mag-Tab SR), and magnesium aspartate appear to be the most bioavailable. Magnesium oxide (MagOx) and magnesium sulfate are only about 4% bioavailable (13383).\nDistribution\nThe body contains about 25 grams of magnesium, which is divided in roughly equal portions between the skeleton and soft tissue (60918). About a third of skeletal magnesium is at the surface of the bone and acts as a reservoir to maintain extracellular magnesium concentrations. The remaining two-thirds is tightly bound to bone and is not readily available as a magnesium source (7555, 12499, 12507). Extracellular magnesium makes up only 1% of total body magnesium. In plasma, 55% is ionized or free, about 30% is bound to plasma proteins, and 15% is complexed to anions (12507, 60918).\n\nMagnesium is thought to undergo a filtration-reabsorption process (9628). The concentration of magnesium in the proximal tubule increases to 1.5 times that in the glomerular filtrate. Approximately 20% to 30% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Reabsorption is thought to change in parallel to sodium as changes occur in the extracellular fluid volume. Approximately 65% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, and most of that occurs in the thick ascending limb. Reabsorption is voltage-dependent and may occur secondary to active sodium chloride reabsorption. Magnesium and calcium compete for transport on the ascending limb cell at the basolateral surface. Factors which play a role in magnesium reabsorption include parathyroid hormone, plasma magnesium and calcium level alterations, and use of loop diuretics.\nExcretion\nMagnesium excretion is primarily via the kidneys and averages only 3% to 5% of the filtered load. Excretion ranges from 10 to 5000 mg over a 24-hour period (13365, 61054). Urinary magnesium and pH are known to modulate urinary calcium excretion; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown (60896).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMagnesium (Mg) is a component of many compounds. It is the seventh most abundant element in the earth's crust by mass. It occurs in magnesite, dolomite, and in mineral waters (90051). Magnesium is well absorbed from foods (12587). Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium (13382). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly among females (8088, 12504, 12505).\nAnalgesic effects\nMagnesium is reported to be an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the potentiation of pain. This effect and magnesium's depressant effects on nerves and smooth muscle are thought to contribute to the possible effects of magnesium in relieving symptoms associated with migraine headaches, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's Phenomenon, and other vascular disorders and pain syndromes (6846, 6848, 8094).\n\nMagnesium might play a role in migraine headache. Low levels of magnesium may induce cerebral arterial vasoconstriction, increase platelet aggregation and promote serotonin release, and potentiate the vasoactive properties of serotonin (6844, 12388).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMagnesium deficiency has been reported to be a trigger for inflammatory processes. A meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials comparing the effects of various magnesium salts, 250-500 mg daily for 4-26 weeks, on inflammatory markers shows that magnesium significantly decreases serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increases nitric oxide (NO) levels when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (108727).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is some evidence that magnesium plays a role in diabetes and metabolic syndrome (1168, 1183). In clinical research, oral magnesium has been reported to improve glycemic control in some patients with type 2 diabetes (1197, 15548, 60854, 61032, 96473). Low magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity (13369, 13372, 105918). Poorly controlled diabetes can cause enhanced osmotic diuresis and increase urinary loss of magnesium (13381). In severe hyperglycemia, tubular reabsorption of magnesium is decreased and may result in lower magnesium levels secondary to increased excretion (13365). Autonomic neuropathy and related autoimmune gastric atrophy may reduce intestinal absorption of magnesium. Also, insulin can increase magnesium excretion (13381). However, in patients with reasonably well-controlled type 2 diabetes, dietary magnesium absorption and retention don't appear to be impaired. Lower serum levels may be related to lower dietary intake (13375). Magnesium seems to affect glucose control and insulin homeostasis. Magnesium blood levels might play a role in insulin resistance (1168, 6844, 14304, 17133). Insulin is involved with the shift of magnesium intracellularly. In turn, intracellular magnesium seems to regulate insulin activity on oxidative glucose metabolism. Low intracellular magnesium causes disorders in tyrosine kinase activity at the insulin receptor level, which results in decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Magnesium is also thought to enhance the action of enzymes involved in glucose utilization (13365, 17133).\nAntioxidant effects\nMagnesium has antioxidant effects that can be reduced by calcium (61106).\nCardiovascular effects\nMagnesium is known to be essential for all ATPase activity, including facilitating movement of calcium across and within the cell membrane of cardiac and vascular tissues (60920). In patients with congestive heart failure, there is evidence magnesium reduces coronary vascular resistance, increases coronary artery blood flow, has antiarrhythmic effects, and improves cardiac indexes (8088).\n\nThere is interest in using magnesium for preventing endothelial function decline, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research suggests that taking magnesium for at least 6 months improves endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients who are unhealthy, over 50 years of age, or overweight (102455). There is also interest in the effects of magnesium on arterial stiffness, which is a predictor of coronary heart disease and stroke. In overweight adults, taking magnesium 450 mg daily as the citrate, oxide, or sulfate salts for 24 weeks does not affect arterial stiffness, measured by the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, when compared with placebo (108730).\n\nThere is some evidence that magnesium is important in regulating blood pressure (1170, 1182). Magnesium deficiency has been found to increase intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium, which can lead to increased peripheral resistance and vasospasm (8088). In cell membranes, a decreased concentration of magnesium and increased calcium to magnesium ratio has also been associated with hypertension (8092). There is also some evidence that hypertensive patients with hypomagnesemia usually require more antihypertensive medications than hypertensive patients with normal magnesium levels (8088).\n\nReduced intracellular magnesium also causes an increase in intracellular calcium. In addition to contributing to insulin resistance, higher intracellular calcium levels enhance calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, and inhibit cardiac and smooth muscle relaxation (13365). This increased vascular tone can increase blood pressure.\n\nThere is some evidence that serum magnesium deficiency might play a role in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (8998).\nDeficiency\nMagnesium deficiency is not uncommon in the US. It's particularly prevalent among African Americans and the elderly. Low intake and impaired absorption of magnesium have also been associated with the development of various disease states such as osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and stroke (8088, 8099, 8998, 9001, 12510, 12511). Hypomagnesemia is usually asymptomatic. The serum magnesium level is the most commonly used test to assess magnesium status. However, it is also known that the serum magnesium level is depressed only in cases of severe magnesium deficiency and that it poorly correlates with body magnesium (8089). The body preserves serum magnesium at the expense of magnesium in cells and bone, so serum levels may appear normal in magnesium deficiency (12510, 12511). Red cell and urine magnesium levels also have been used but they are also poor indicators of body magnesium (8085, 8089). The intravenous magnesium loading test is considered to be a more reliable test to measure magnesium status. However, the test is cumbersome and requires full participation from the patient. It is known that serum magnesium actually consists of three fractions. They are protein-bound, complexed, and free ionic magnesium. It is the free ionic magnesium that is biologically active. Whether the serum magnesium level is low or normal, free ionic magnesium levels have been shown to vary with many disorders such as cardiac disease, stroke, diabetes, and migraines. In recent years, instruments have become available that measure free ionic magnesium, allowing for a more accurate assessment of body magnesium. However, measurement of ionized magnesium may not be readily available in labs outside the research setting (8090).\n\nSymptoms of severe magnesium deficiency include convulsions; confusion; muscle weakness; abnormal muscle movements such as tremors, myoclonus, and tetany; and arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and torsades de pointes (403, 13383). Long-term magnesium deficiency might increase the risk of arrhythmias and the rate of developing atherosclerosis (13383).\nGastrointestinal\nAs antacids, magnesium salts work by reacting with gastric acid to form magnesium chloride. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action, magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure, and magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration due to its poor solubility (6844).\n\nThe laxative effects and diarrhea produced by magnesium salts are due to the osmotic effects of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon, and stimulation of gastric motility due to the release of gastrin and cholecystokinin (6844).\nHormonal effects\nIntracellular levels of magnesium, measured in erythrocytes and leukocytes, have been found to be lower in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), leading to the use of magnesium supplements for PMS (6847). Oral magnesium has been reported to benefit mood changes associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (1187).\n\nSupplementation of thyroid hormone to hypothyroid animals restored magnesium levels and transport. Therefore, thyroid hormones may have an effect on magnesium homeostasis (60899).\nImmune effects\nIn clinical research, magnesium has been shown to decrease plasma cortisol levels (2826). Additional research suggests low serum magnesium is related to low-grade chronic inflammation. Hypomagnesemia is associated with elevated serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP), which has been linked to metabolic syndrome (13366). Magnesium intake inversely correlates with CRP levels: females with high dietary magnesium intake have lower levels of CRP, which may reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The relationship is strongest in overweight or obese females (BMI >25) and current or past smokers (13369). Other epidemiological research in adults has found that consuming less that the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium is associated with a 1.48 to 1.75 times higher risk of having an elevated CRP. In adults over age 40 with a BMI >25, consumption of less than 50% of the RDA for magnesium correlates with a 2.24 times higher risk of elevated CRP (13371, 13373). However, it is unclear if magnesium supplementation reduces CRP levels. One meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials including 927 patients with various conditions shows that supplemental magnesium does not reduce CRP levels when compared with placebo (105921). The included studies were not designed to assess CRP levels or baseline magnesium status, limiting the validity of this finding.\nMuscular effects\nExtracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions (272). The inhibitory effect of magnesium on preterm labor contractions (tocolysis) is attributed to antagonism of calcium-mediated myometrial contractions (6844). Oral magnesium has been reported to reduce the incidence of pregnancy-related leg cramps which may be associated with lower serum magnesium levels (1194). Magnesium was also found to be effective in preventing succinylcholine-induced muscle twitching, which is an adverse effect of patients undergoing general anesthesia (60834).\nNeurological effects\nExtracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions (272). Preliminary evidence shows magnesium may act as a neuroprotective agent in patients diagnosed with acute stroke. Several possible mechanisms of neuroprotection exist, including noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism and calcium channel antagonism (9000, 9003).Magnesium levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia (12584).\n\nIn animal research, magnesium has been shown to have neuroprotective effects (60986). It was shown to prevent post-hypoxic brain injury by blocking the excess release of glutamate in the calcium channel. Fetal and newborn brains appear to be more susceptible to damage from glutamate release; therefore, blocking glutamate receptors through agents such as magnesium may reduce the risk of injury in the perinatal period. However, clinical studies to date have not shown a definite fetal neuroprotective benefit from prenatal administration of magnesium to pregnant patients, although prenatal magnesium therapy may improve motor function in early childhood for infants born prematurely (114681).\n\nThe role of magnesium in the prevention or control of convulsions may involve blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the release of acetylcholine at the motor nerve terminals (61006).\n\nThe mechanism of action for magnesium in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is not clear. There is some evidence that magnesium dilates blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce ischemia. Contrary to this view are indications that magnesium may decrease CNS blood flow (9473). Additionally, magnesium may have anticonvulsant actions in eclampsia due to depression of neuromuscular transmission, direct depressant effect on smooth muscle, and CNS depression (6844).\n\nThere is interest in using magnesium for improving symptoms of insomnia and other sleep disturbances. In a small clinical study in elderly patients with primary insomnia, magnesium intake increased levels of melatonin and reduced levels of cortisol, which might contribute to improved sleep (102458). Additionally, low magnesium levels have been linked to poor sleep quality and also to electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities during slow wave sleep. Magnesium has been theorized to regulate sleep by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (102456).\nOtic effects\nOral magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss. It is hypothesized that magnesium may improve permanent hearing threshold shifts (NIPTS) (1205, 60813).\nPulmonary\nIn asthma, intravenous administration of magnesium might cause bronchodilation (2003, 60889).\nRenal effects\nThere is some evidence that magnesium metabolism is a factor in renal stone formation and prevention (2006, 2007). There is preliminary evidence that magnesium can reduce hypertension and nephrotoxicity induced by cyclosporine. Magnesium supplementation appears to reduce the thickening of the renal vascular walls that may occur with cyclosporine therapy; potassium supplementation may increase the effectiveness of magnesium for this use (9500).\nSkeletal effects\nMagnesium is important for normal bone structure (272), and plays an essential role in more than 300 cellular reactions (945). Magnesium is required for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and is involved in ion movements across cell membranes (945). It is involved in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism (272).\n\nMagnesium deficiency increases the formation and activity of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells). Magnesium deficiency causes increases in substance P and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in bone, which increase osteoclastic bone resorption. Increased bone resorption causes release of magnesium as well as calcium from bone. Since magnesium is an essential nutrient, the body may sacrifice bone in times of deficiency as a magnesium source to maintain homeostasis (12499, 12500). Magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but its exact role is unknown (7555).\n\nMagnesium, like calcium, is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). In humans, severe to moderate magnesium deficiency commonly causes hypocalcemia. Normally, magnesium deficiency increases PTH activity. PTH increases renal calcium reabsorption, increases phosphate excretion, and increases renal magnesium reabsorption. Impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity and impaired response to PTH seem to be the predominant reasons that magnesium-deficient people are also hypocalcemic (12499). However, clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate 350 mg taken daily by mouth for 3 weeks does not affect calcium blood levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism taking maintenance therapy of calcium and a vitamin D analog (90010).\n\nClinical research suggests that magnesium, alone or in combination with calcium, vitamin D, and zinc, reduces bone turnover (60928, 60934, 60950). In combination with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals, magnesium increases bone density (36840). Magnesium supplementation in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis results in decreased serum iPTH and urinary deoxypyridinoline and increased serum osteocalcin (60928, 60950)."

Magnolol is largely metabolized in the liver. Its major metabolites are glucuronides. The metabolic pathways for honokiol are glucuronidation and sulphation (95034).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of magnolia are the bark and flower bud. Magnolia bark contains the active constituents magnolol, dihydroxydihdromagnolol, honokiol, dihydrohonokiol, and obovatol (11945, 11946, 11947, 11948, 94904, 95032, 95035). Magnolol and honokiol are thought to be the most active constituents (95035). The ratio of magnolol to honokiol is reported to be approximately 4:1 (95034). Magnolia also contains magnoliaterpenoids, volatile oils, and various minerals (92462, 95035). Proportions of constituents in the bark differ depending on harvesting site and time (95035).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMagnolia lignans, including magnolol and honokiol, appear to downregulate the activation of nuclear factor- kappa beta and block its activation, leading to a decrease in transcription of genes involved in pro-inflammatory responses. Magnolol and honokiol also inhibit the formation of eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 likely via inhibition of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (95035).\nAnticancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that magnolol might have anti-leukemic properties (11949). Honokiol and magnolol appear to target numerous signaling pathways involved in cancer initiation and progression, leading to regulation of certain genes and induction of apoptosis. Obovotaol and alkaloids may also play a role in magnolia's anticancer effects (95035).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn animals, honokiol and magnolol help to prevent insulin resistance, reduce fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin, and induce glucose uptake in adipocytes. Honokiol also enhances insulin signaling pathways. Laboratory research suggests that magnolia may also inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products, which play a role in diabetic complications. Furthermore, honokiol and magnolol inhibit acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl-transferase which is responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol. Magnolol activates proliferator-activated receptor gamma, causes adipocyte differentiation, and increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (95035).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe anti-bacterial effects of the magnolia constituents magnolol and honokiol are thought to play a role in the prevention of gingivitis as seen in clinical trials. Both bacterial counts and pH levels of plaque are improved (92459). Furthermore, magnolia bark extract, in combination with zinc acetate in tablets or chewing gum, reduces the production of bacterial volatile sulfur-containing compounds (92466, 92467).\n\nBoth magnolol and honokiol also appear to be active against many gram positive and gram negative bacteria, as well as a few fungal strains. They may alter cell permeability. Alkaloids found in magnolia may also interfere with the viral reproduction cycle (95035).\nAntiplatelet effects\nMagnolol and honokiol have reversible antiplatelet effects in vitro. They inhibit collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, probably by inhibiting thromboxane A2 formation (18273, 95035). They also activate pathways that inhibit platelet aggregation and alter the cytosolic calcium concentration which affects platelet responses to agonists (95035). The antiplatelet effects of honokiol are 5 to 10 times more potent than those of magnolol (18273).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe positive effects of magnolia on atherosclerosis are attributed to the antioxidant activities of magnolol and honokiol. Laboratory research suggests that honokiol decreases the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, reactive oxygen species generation, intracellular calcium accumulation, and alleviates effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein. Magnolol also interferes with reactive oxygen species generation (95035).\nCNS effects\nMagnolia constituents seem to have central nervous system effects. Magnolol, honokiol, and dihydroxydihydromagnolol seem to have antidepressant effects (11950). These effects may be related to altered serotonin turnover in the brain (95034). Magnolia also interacts with dopamine and serotonin receptors. Honokiol and magnolol increase acetylcholine release in the brain, and magnolol appears to modulate serotonergic activity (95035).\n\nHonokiol and dihydrohonokiol seem to have anxiolytic effects in animals, possibly by interacting with gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors and muscarinic receptors (11946, 11947, 95034, 95035). In animals, honokiol increased glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of GABA (95035). Honokiol is reported to have similar effects as diazepam (95031). Magnolia been used in drug sponsored clinical trials showing some efficacy for reduction of anxiety and stress (34246, 94904). These effects may be attributed to its ability to modulate neurotransmitters and enzymes including acetylcholine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase (94904). In one clinical trial, magnolia reduced the levels of the stress hormone cortisol, compared to placebo (94904).\n\nDihydrohonokiol doesn't seem to cause motor dysfunction, CNS depression, amnesia, or physical dependence at doses that produce an anxiolytic effect (11948). At high doses, magnolia bark seems to have CNS depressant effects. Honokiol seems to inhibit catecholamine secretion (11952).\n\nMagnolol and honokiol might enhance cholinergic function, which could be useful in diseases such as Alzheimer's. At high doses, these compounds increase acetylcholine release in the hippocampus of the brain and have a neurotrophic effect, theoretically improving neuronal function (11951). In animals, magnolia dose-dependently inhibited a scopolamine-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase, leading to increased levels of acetylcholine. Also, magnolol, honokiol and its derivatives are neuroprotective and act as antioxidants and reduce reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, magnolia may also possibly decrease beta-amyloid peptide release and beta-amyloid peptide-induced cell death (95035).\n\nIt also appears that magnolol is a partial agonist of both endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, exhibiting higher potency at CB2. The fecal metabolite, tetrahydromagnolol (THM) is a full CB1 agonist and partial CB2 agonist. Another component of magnolia, honokiol, is a full agonist at the CB1 receptor, and is an antagonist or inverse agonist at the CB2 receptor. Honokiol, magnolol and its metabolite THM all have higher activity at CB1 than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (95034).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIt is thought that magnolia is an antispasmodic and acts to relax gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle. Both magnolol and honokiol are non-competitive muscarinic antagonists, and inhibit contractions induced by acetylcholine, serotonin, or calcium dependent contractions induced by acetylcholine. Alkaloids present in magnolia may also play a role (95035).\nRespiratory effects\nThe constituent magnone may have platelet-activating factor antagonist activity, which might explain the use of magnolia in nasal congestion and rhinitis (11953). There is interest in using magnolia for asthma. Magnolol appears to suppress the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by blocking hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. It increases the production of corticosterone, a glucocorticoid similar to cortisol (11945, 95035). Additionally, magnolol inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation and suppress type IV allergic reactions, which are lymphocyte mediated. Magnolol and honokiol also induce bronchodilation through calcium antagonism. Furthermore, alkaloids present in magnolia inhibit acetylcholine induced contraction (95035). This may explain magnolia's use for asthma.\nWeight loss effects\nFor weight loss, researchers suggest that a specific magnolia product containing a combination of extracts of magnolia plus phellodendron (Relora, Next Pharmaceuticals) helps reduce cortisol levels and therefore helps to reduce stress. It's theorized that reducing stress will reduce stress-induced eating habits. However, clinical research suggests that this magnolia product does not significantly reduce cortisol levels in overweight females (14349). However, it has reduced cortisol levels in other clinical research (94904). Some weight loss products include magnolia bark with claims that it reduces cortisol levels. Currently, clinical evidence that magnolia bark causes weight loss or reduces cortisol levels is conflicting. In fact, it appears to increase levels of corticosterone, a glucocorticoid similar to cortisol (11945)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals, 500 mg/kg of argaricoglycerides, secondary metabolites of maitake mushroom, produced a Tmax of about 1 hour and a Cmax of about 0.63 mcg/mL. The bioavailability estimated as the area under the curve was 3.2%. Doses of 100 or 300 mg/kg could not be detected in the plasma (92842).\nDistribution\nAnimal research suggests that beta-glucan from maitake mushroom is distributed to the liver and spleen with a prolonged half-life (61246).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of maitake mushroom are the fruiting body and mycelium. Active constituents include polysaccharides such as beta-glucans in the fruit body, specifically the \"D-fraction\" of beta-glucan, a water-soluble glycoprotein called \"SX-fraction\" or MSX, the secondary metabolites argaricoglycerides, and fiber (17131, 61218, 61232, 61239, 92842, 92843).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using maitake mushroom for its anti-inflammatory activity, which has been shown to confer analgesic effects. Animal research suggests that argaricoglycerides extracted from maitake mycelia attenuate endotoxin-induced increases in proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappa B. These extracts also decrease levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Animal models also show that these extracts confer both peripheral and central analgesic effects (92842).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is interest in using maitake mushroom for its antineoplastic effects. Multiple antitumor mechanisms have been proposed, based on results of laboratory and animal research (61243), including induction of nitric oxide synthase by maitake D-fraction (61223, 61247), enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor by macrophages (61220, 61244, 61245), apoptosis (61233, 61234), antiangiogenesis with increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels induced by D-fraction (61219), oxidative damage and induced apoptosis by beta-glucan (61215), increased Kupffer cell activity against neoplastic cells (61250), enhanced lymphocyte activity (61249), and alternative complement pathway activation (61241). There is also interest in using maitake mushroom for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It is thought that neutrophil dysfunction in patients with MDS, and not actual neutrophil count, contributes to an increase in infections, even in patients with neutropenia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking maitake fruiting body extract (beta-glucan) 3 mg/kg twice daily for 12 weeks, increases endogenous neutrophil and monocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and increases ROS responses to bacterial stimuli, compared to age-matched healthy controls, in patients with MDS. These effects are necessary for bactericidal activity. Furthermore, in laboratory research, maitake mushroom beta-glucan induces granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stimulates interleukin (IL)-12 production, and activates natural killer cells. It may also enhance differentiation and migration of hematopoietic cells (92843).\nAntiviral effects\nA novel anti-herpes simplex virus protein has been purified from an extract of maitake mushroom (61237). In addition, laboratory research suggests that the D-fraction from maitake mushroom inhibits the hepatitis B virus and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with interferon-alpha (61232).\nCardiovascular effects\nMaitake mushroom powder and extracts produce a decrease in blood pressure in animal models of hypertension (1214, 61226, 61242).\nHormonal effects\nThere is interest in using maitake mushroom for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In patients with PCOS, insulin resistance with resultant hyperinsulinemia leads to hyperandrogenism. In animals, maitake mushroom has been shown to decrease blood glucose. A specific fraction called SX-fraction (MSX) may decrease glucose and improve insulin resistance (17131).\nHypoglycemic effects\nThere is interest in using maitake mushroom for its hypoglycemic effects. Enhanced insulin-hypoglycemic activity has been observed in rats consuming a specific glycoprotein extracted from maitake mushroom (61238). An alpha-glucan from the fruit body of maitake mushroom has also exhibited an antidiabetic effect in mice (61236). Antidiabetic effects of maitake mushroom extracts have been shown in other animal studies, resulting in reduced levels of blood glucose in diabetic models (1212, 61217, 61222, 61226). In these studies, depending on the model, insulin levels were increased or decreased, and fructosamine was decreased. Decreased glycated hemoglobin has also been observed in an animal model after treatment with maitake mushroom powder (61226). In human research, maitake mushroom reduced blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (8188). The extract responsible for improving insulin resistance is believed to be the water-soluble glycoprotein called \"SX-fraction\" or MSX (17131). Polysaccharides also appear to have a hypoglycemic effect, possibly by activating insulin receptors (1212, 8188). Another theory is that maitake mushroom can improve glucose tolerance by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd), which seems to increase insulin sensitivity. Research in obese mice models fed a high-fat diet shows that consuming a lipid soluble maitake mushroom extract activates PPARd-target genes and improves glucose tolerance (99569).\nImmunomodulating effects\nLaboratory research suggests that maitake mushroom possesses immunomodulating activities (61231, 61235). The relatively low-molecular-mass polysaccharides isolated from mycelia of maitake mushroom may enhance innate immunity by enhancing phagocytosis and increasing natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and therefore may serve as biological response modifiers (61231). Activation of helper T cells, decreased activation of B cells, and increased production of Interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12 p70, and IL-18, but suppression of IL-4, have also been observed (61224). In an animal immunosuppression model, a maitake polysaccharide extract increased lymph node levels of T-cells and natural killer cells, but not B cells (111936). In human research, increasing doses of maitake mushroom resulted in increases in some immunologic parameters and decreases in others for many of the endpoints measured (61239). The optimal dose with the largest immunological effect varied for different parameters tested, but positive effects were most often seen with doses between 5-7 mg/kg daily (61239). The \"D-fraction\" of beta-glucan in maitake mushroom may be the component responsible for the immune-stimulating effects (17131, 61232).\nLipid effects\nIn animal research, maitake mushroom reduced plasma levels of triglycerides (1212, 61226) and total cholesterol (1214). Fiber from maitake mushroom also resulted in a reduction in cholesterol (61218). Maitake mushroom extract also seems to improve lipid levels in animals fed a high-fat diet. Research in obese mice models fed a high-fat diet shows that consuming a lipid soluble maitake mushroom extract lowers total blood cholesterol levels. This effect might occur because maitake mushroom activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd), a key regulator of lipid metabolism (99569). Additional research in high-fat fed rats shows that consuming a 95% maitake mushroom ethanol extract reduces total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and weight (99570).\nPhotoprotective effects\nExopolysaccharide from maitake mushroom demonstrated photoprotective potential in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to ultraviolet-A (UVA) light (61230). It has been proposed that exopolysaccharide may contribute to inhibitory action in photoaging skin by reducing the MMP 1-related matrix degradation system."

Malic acid disrupts cellular skin adhesions by chelating calcium ions, which speeds up skin desquamation. In a case report, a 42 year old man with cutaneous warts received a topical application of malic and citric acid in equal parts 10 grams/10 mL on each wart twice daily for 10 days. An occlusive dressing was also applied. The patient experienced a strong irritant reaction which caused the skin to peel and eliminate the warts. The patient did not experience recurrence of warts for at least 6 months after the application of malic and citric acid (95564).\nGastrointestinal effects\nMalic acid is used for dry mouth because its acidity stimulates saliva production. It is thought that the sour taste stimulates the production of saliva. However, if used too frequently, the acidity can corrode teeth (95565).\nHypotensive effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that malic acid isolated from tagetes roots can reduce mean arterial blood pressure in rats (26970).\nWeight gain effects\nMalic acid is involved in the Krebs cycle, a process used by the body to generate energy.

It is also an essential nutrient involved in normal cell growth, generation of the immune response, glucose regulation, and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins (99415). Manganese acts as a cofactor in several metabolic and enzymatic reactions (2003, 7135, 61506, 61556). It is found in foods including nuts, legumes, seeds, tea, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables (2005, 2008, 7135).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Oral manganese is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 11 mg daily for adults 19 years and older (1994, 7135). ...when used parenterally and appropriately. Parenteral manganese chloride and manganese sulfate are FDA-approved prescription products.\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Doses exceeding 11 mg daily can cause significant adverse effects (7135). ...when used parenterally in moderate or high doses, long-term. Reports of neurotoxicity and Parkinson-like symptoms have been reported with parenteral nutrition manganese doses above 60 mcg daily. It is recommended that adults on long-term parenteral nutrition receive manganese in doses of no more than 55 mcg daily (99302).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled in moderate doses, long-term. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for manganese is 5 mg/m3. Exposure to higher amounts of manganese dust or fumes has been associated with central nervous system toxicity, Parkinson-like symptoms, and poor bone health (61296, 102516).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Manganese is safe in children when used in daily doses less than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2 mg in children 1-3 years, 3 mg in children 4-8 years, 6 mg in children 9-13 years, and 9 mg in children 14-18 years (7135).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Daily doses greater than the UL are associated with a greater risk of toxicity (7135).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled at moderate doses, long-term. Exposure to high amounts of manganese dust has been associated with central nervous system toxicity and Parkinson-like symptoms (61296).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Manganese is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 11 mg daily during pregnancy or lactation in those aged 19 or older. However, those under 19 years of age should limit doses to less than 9 mg daily (7135).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Doses over the UL are associated with a greater risk of toxicity (7135). Additionally, observational research shows that adults with higher blood manganese levels have greater odds of delivering low birth weight or small for gestational age (SGA) male, but not female, infants (102515).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled at moderate doses, long-term. Manganese salts can cross the placenta, and animal research suggests that large amounts of manganese may be teratogenic (61296).",

In one case, a 13-year-old female with manganese intoxication developed severe, life-threatening neurological symptoms, with liver biopsy indicating incomplete cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis. Chelation therapy and multiple rounds of therapeutic plasma exchange were required before symptoms resolved. The source of manganese exposure was not identified, and it is not clear if the impaired liver function contributed to the manganese accumulation or if elevated manganese exposure led to the liver damage.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nChronic occupational exposure to manganese dust or fumes has been associated with lower bone quality in females, but not males, suggesting that prolonged manganese exposure might increase the risk of osteoporosis in females (102516). A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies in adults also suggests that increased environmental exposure to airborne manganese sources is associated with lower motor function scores (108537).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, there is concern that higher doses of manganese might increase the risk of neurotoxicity, including Parkinson-like extrapyramidal symptoms (7135, 10665, 10666). One severe case of irreversible Parkinson disease possibly related to taking manganese 100 mg daily for 2-4 years has been reported (96418). In another case, a 13-year-old female with manganese intoxication (diagnosed from blood manganese levels and cranial MRI evidence) developed severe neurological symptoms including loss of consciousness, decorticate posture, clonus, increased reflexes in the extremities, isochoric pupils, and no painful stimulus response. Liver biopsy also showed incomplete cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis. The patient was intubated, and chelation therapy and multiple rounds of therapeutic plasma exchange were required before symptoms resolved. The source of the child's manganese exposure was not identified (112137). Individuals with impaired manganese excretion can also experience these effects even with very low manganese intake. Manganese accumulation due to chronic liver disease seems to cause Parkinson-like extrapyramidal symptoms, encephalopathy, and psychosis (1992, 7135). One review recommends stopping supplementation if aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels rise beyond twice normal (99302).\n\nChronic occupational exposure to manganese dust or fumes can also cause extrapyramidal reactions (1990, 7135). In 1837, Couper observed that exposure to manganese dust particles produces a neurological syndrome characterized by muscle weakness, tremor, bent posture, whispered speech, and excess salivation (61264). Additionally, observational research in children has found that elevated manganese levels detected in the hair and fingernails due to environmental exposure may be associated with impaired neurocognitive function or development (108535). A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies in adults also suggests that increased environmental exposure to airborne manganese sources is associated with lower cognitive function scores (108537).\n\nIntravenously, manganese might increase the risk of neurotoxicity when administered at high doses or for an extended duration. Cases of Parkinson-like symptoms have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition containing more than 60 mcg of manganese daily. Moderate MRI intensity uptake for manganese in the globus pallidus and basal ganglion areas of the brain has been shown in patients receiving parenteral manganese (96416, 99302).\nless\nPsychiatric\nChronic occupational exposure to manganese dust or fumes can cause mood disturbance and dementia (1990, 7135). A case report describes a man who presented with confusion, psychosis, dystonic limb movements, and cognitive impairment after chronic industrial manganese exposure (99415). Symptoms of manganese toxicity from inhalational exposure develop slowly with initial fatigue and personality changes, progressing to hallucinations, delusions, hyperexcitability, Parkinson-like symptoms, dystonia, and dementia (99415). Additionally, observational research has found that chronic environmental exposure to manganese sources such as mining operations and various industrial processes may be associated with a greater risk for developing symptoms of depression (108536).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nChronic occupational exposure to manganese dust or fumes can cause acute chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, or acute tracheobronchitis (61495).\nless",

Oral manganese has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in overweight adults shows that taking a specific combination product (7-Keto Naturalean, Enzymatic Therapy, Inc.) containing manganese 500 mcg, 7-oxo-DHEA 100 mg, L-tyrosine 100 mg, asparagus root extract 100 mg, choline bitartrate 50 mg, inositol 50 mg, copper gluconate 500 mcg, and potassium iodide 100 mcg daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight by around 1.5 kg and body mass index (BMI) by around 0.7 kg/m2 when compared with placebo (61581).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral manganese has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and lower back show that taking a specific combination product (Cosamin DS, Nutramax Laboratories) containing manganese ascorbate 228-304 mg (about 31-41 mg of elemental manganese), glucosamine hydrochloride 1500-2000 mg, and chondroitin sulfate 1200-1600 mg daily for 4 months improves pain and ability to do activities of daily living when compared with baseline or placebo (4237, 7169). The amount of manganese in the Cosamin DS formulation used in this study is considerably higher than the 1 mg of elemental manganese per 1500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride in the current formulation. Since numerous studies show glucosamine with chondroitin without manganese might be effective for osteoarthritis, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of manganese alone.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral manganese has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking manganese 5 mg in combination with elemental calcium 1000 mg, zinc 15 mg, and copper 2.5 mg daily for 2 years reduces spinal bone loss when compared with placebo (1994). Another small clinical study in females with osteopenia shows that taking a specific combination product (Vitrum Osteomag, Unipharm Inc.) containing manganese 1.8 mg, calcium 600 mg, vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 200 IU, magnesium 40 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, copper 1 mg, and boron 250 mcg twice daily for one year improves bone mineral density when compared with no treatment (36840). However, since numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of calcium plus vitamin D for osteoporosis, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of manganese alone.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral manganese has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in patients with PMS shows that taking manganese 1.0 mg or 5.6 mg in combination with calcium 587 mg or 1336 mg daily for about 24 weeks improves symptoms of PMS including pain, crying, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, mood swings, depression, and tension (2004).\nless\nWound healing. Topical manganese has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research has found that applying an alginate dressing containing manganese, calcium, and zinc to chronic wounds for 12 weeks is associated with improved wound healing when compared with previous treatments (61327).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTypically less than 5% of dietary manganese is absorbed (12468). It is unknown how the absorption of manganese from supplements compares with dietary sources. Males seem to absorb less manganese than females. This might be due to higher serum ferritin concentrations in males, resulting in decreased manganese absorption (7135).\n\nWhen manganese is inhaled, it bypasses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain (99415).\nDistribution\nAbsorbed manganese stays in the blood for a relatively short time, but accumulates in tissues, including bone, where it can remain for many years (99415).\nExcretion\nManganese is cleared hepatically. Chronic liver disease and biliary disorders can cause manganese accumulation and toxicity (1992, 99415).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nManganese is an essential nutrient that acts as a cofactor in several metabolic and enzymatic reactions (2003, 7135). Manganese is found in several foods including nuts, legumes, seeds, tea, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables (2005, 2008, 7135). Manganese is involved in amino acid, cholesterol, and carbohydrate metabolism, normal cell growth, generation of the immune response, and glucose regulation (7135, 99415). Manganese metalloenzymes include arginase, glutamine synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase, and manganese superoxide (7135).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn patients with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), low dietary manganese has been associated with altered mood and increased pain (7135).\nInflammatory effects\nThere seems to be a positive correlation between the level of dietary manganese intake and circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Preliminary data show that interleukin 1-beta (IL-1-beta) levels are 46% higher in people in the highest quartile of manganese intake compared to the lowest. Similarly, IL-6 levels are 52% higher, and IL-8 levels are 32% higher (99417).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nManganese accumulation seems to play a role in Parkinson symptoms and encephalopathy associated with chronic liver disease (1992, 10666). High levels of manganese in the brain interfere with mitochondrial function, leading to oxidation and depletion of dopamine and interference with dopaminergic neurotransmission (10665, 99415). Manganese competes for transport by transferrin in the brain, displacing iron and increasing unbound iron in the cerebrospinal fluid. This iron accumulates in neurons, causing oxidative stress and neuronal damage (12468, 99415). The globus pallidus and substantia nigra, areas of the brain associated with the extrapyramidal system, are high in transferrin receptor density, which may result in concentration of manganese (7135). Manganese also binds to acetylcholinesterase, leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of its receptors (99415).\nSkeletal effects\nResearchers think manganese might have a role in osteoporosis. Decreased plasma manganese concentrations have been linked to osteoporosis, and bone mineral density seems to improve when trace minerals including manganese are added to calcium supplementation (7135)."

Oral and topical mangosteen may modestly improve gum health.\nA small clinical study in adults with chronic periodontitis shows that applying a gel containing mangosteen pericarp 4% to the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing procedures improves pocket depth, clinical attachment, and bleeding by 56% to 63%, compared with a 33% to 42% improvement with placebo (97875). Another small clinical study in similar patients shows that applying mangosteen 4% gel to the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planning improves pocket depth and clinical attachment when compared with placebo. However, plaque and bleeding indices were not compared between groups (110126). A clinical study in patients with generalized or localized gingivitis or stage I periodontitis shows that taking 194 mg of a product containing mangosteen and propolis orally improves the modified gingival index by 31% or 40% at weeks 4 or 8, respectively, compared with 16% or 25% in those receiving placebo.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans consuming 59 mL of mangosteen juice containing 94.2 mg of xanthones, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of alpha-mangostin, a constituent of mangosteen, was approximately 3 ng/mL. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 1 hour. In another pharmacokinetic study, the Cmax of alpha-mangostin was 113 nmol/L and the Tmax was 3.7 hours following consumption of 60 mL of mangosteen juice containing 130 mg of xanthones.

However, urinary excretion of xanthones accounted for only 2% of the total ingested dose, suggesting that mangosteen and its xanthones are primarily excreted in the feces. This is supported by findings of high concentrations of xanthones in animal feces (92804).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAll parts of the plant are used, including the fruit rinds, seeds, leaves, and bark (97876, 97877). Mangosteen contains anthocyanic glycosides, several prenylated xanthones (61665), isomangiferin, and mangiferin (61676). The fruit hulls and leaves contain terpenoids and sugars (61671). The medicinal properties of mangosteen have been attributed to the secondary metabolites known as xanthones, found in the pericarp of mangosteen. At least 68 different xanthones have been identified in mangosteen, with the pericarp containing higher amounts of approximately 50 of these xanthones. The most abundant, and often reported xanthones include alpha- and gamma-mangostin (12016, 61664, 92804, 92805, 97877). Mangosteen also contains sesquiterpenes, beta-mangostin, mangostenone C, gartanins, and garcinones (12015, 12016, 61674, 97875, 97877).\nAnti-allergy effects\nLaboratory research suggests that alpha-mangostin from the fruit hull of mangosteen is a competitive antagonist of histamine H1 receptors in smooth muscle (12017). Ethanol extracts of mangosteen fruit hull also appear to inhibit immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated histamine release and prostaglandin E2 synthesis. This is most likely due to alpha- and gamma-mangostin (12017, 61664).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn an obese rat model of type 2 diabetes, an ethanolic extract of mangosteen pericarp attenuates diabetes-induced increases in fasting blood glucose (106788).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using mangosteen and/or its xanthones for anti-inflammatory effects. Laboratory and animal research suggest that xanthones inhibit inflammatory responses and induced edema via multiple mechanisms including attenuation of the expression of inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2, decreasing expression of inflammatory signaling pathways, and suppression of histamine release and reduced cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA (16399, 61662, 61669, 61677, 92804). In animals, pretreatment with mangosteen extract protected from systemic anaphylaxis and inhibited adjuvant-induced arthritis (61679). In an obese rat model of type 2 diabetes, an ethanolic extract of mangosteen pericarp attenuated diabetes-induced increases in levels of interleukin 6 and TNF-alpha, as well as increases in the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in glial cells in the hippocampal region (106788). In clinical research, results have been mixed, with some reports of reduction in periodontal inflammation and C-reactive protein levels with use of mangosteen, while other markers of inflammation have actually increased (92804). Alpha- and gamma-mangostin constituents have anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory research (97875).\nAnti-oxidant effects\nHuman, animal, and laboratory research suggests that mangosteen extract has antioxidant effects (97877, 106788). In an obese rat model of type 2 diabetes, an ethanolic extract of mangosteen pericarp attenuates diabetes-induced increases in superoxide dismutase activity (106788). Laboratory research suggests the antioxidant effects of mangosteen are primarily due to the xanthones alpha- and gamma-mangostin (61675).\nAnti-proliferative effects\nThere is interest in using mangosteen and/or its xanthones for anti-proliferative effects. Laboratory and animal research suggest that xanthones have anti-proliferative effects on models of mammary, mouth, liver, lung, stomach, adrenal, glioblastoma, prostate, leukemia, colon, and colorectal cancers. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, as well as activation of various caspases, loss of mitochondrial potential, inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) topoisomerase II, induction of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways, and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activities which can lead to decreased adhesion and migration of cancer cells, are all possible mechanisms of action (12013, 12015, 61666, 61667, 61668, 61670, 61674, 92804). And in some cases, mangosteen has been more effective than traditional chemotherapeutic agents (12015, 61668). Additionally, alpha-mangostin is an inhibitor of mitochondrial function, disrupting the electron transport chain and ATP production, causing accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and inducing apoptosis. These effects might also lead to lactic acidosis, however (16399).\nAnti-viral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that an alcohol extract of fresh mangosteen fruit peel containing gamma-mangostin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of HIV-1 protease (61680). Isomangiferin and mangiferin also appear to inhibit HSV-1 replication (61676).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that alpha-mangostin, isolated from the stem bark of mangosteen, is active against five strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and nine strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with synergistic antibacterial effects against VRE and MRSA when combined with gentamycin and vancomycin, respectively (61671). Ethanolic and benzene extracts of whole mangosteen and mangosteen pericarps also have been reported to inhibit MRSA, the effect being due to alpha-mangostin and possibly tannin content (13702, 61682). Additional laboratory research suggests extracts of mangosteen fruit pericarps have activity against Salmonella enteritidis, possibly due to direct antimicrobial activity or the production of reactive oxygen species because the extract seemed to stimulate white blood cells to produce oxidative bursts (61684). Mangosteen and its xanthones have also demonstrated activity against Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylcoccus epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12014, 61672).\nCognitive effects\nA small clinical study in adults with Alzheimer disease shows that treatment with oral mangosteen pericarp extract leads to a small reduction in serum levels of 4-hydroxynonenal when compared with placebo (110127).\nExercise effects\nThere is interest in using mangosteen for muscle fatigue. It is thought that fatigue is generated by overproduction of reactive oxygen species and depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mangosteen has been shown to exhibit free radical scavenging properties in laboratory studies; however, in clinical research these effects have not translated into beneficial effects on physical fatigue or biochemical markers of physical fatigue (92805).\nHematologic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that mangosteen is a competitive 5-hydroxytrptamine 2A receptor antagonist, blocking platelet aggregation (61685).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nLaboratory research suggests that mangosteen is a competitive 5-hydroxytrptamine 2A receptor antagonist, blocking muscle contraction (61685). A methanolic extract of mangosteen (yielding alpha- and gamma-mangostin) also inhibited muscle contraction by blocking histamine and serotonin receptors (12017).\nNeurological effects\nMangosteen is used to improve mental health. In animal models, mangosteen extract prevented cognitive impairment and suppressed the activity of acetylcholinesterase (97877)."

Plasma levels return to baseline after about 8 hours (98665).\nMetabolism\nAfter oral consumption of maqui extract, the constituents delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside are metabolized to gallic acid and protocatechuic acid (98665).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of maqui are the berries and leaves. The berry contains a high concentration of phenolic antioxidants, with the majority of its antioxidant capacity coming from the aqueous, anthocyanin-rich fraction of the juice (17538, 98668, 98669). The average total anthocyanin content of fresh maqui berry is about 138 mg/100 grams. From dried berries, the average total anthocyanin content is about 212 mg/100 grams (17539, 17541). Primary anthocyanins from maqui berry include the delphinidin 3-sambubiosides and delphinidin 3-glucosides. Delphinidin 3-sambubioside-5-glucoside represents 34% of total anthocyanin content (17539, 98666). Maqui berries and leaves also contain caffeic and gallic acids, quercetin, rutin, myricetin, catechin, epicatechin, delphinidin, malvidin, petunidin, cyanidin, peonidin, coumarins, triterpenes, flavonoids, indole alkaloids, and anthocyanins (17540, 109544). The berries also contain dietary fiber, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins (109545).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn animal research using a formalin pain model, a maqui berry extract containing 1.6% anthocyanins, given orally or parenterally, inhibits the central and inflammatory phases of nociception. Effects are dose-dependent, and the central effects of higher maqui doses are similar to those of tramadol. Delphinidin and cyanidin inhibit mediators of pain and inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression (109545).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPolyphenol anthocyanin compounds from maqui berry might affect carbohydrate metabolism. In vitro, maqui polyphenols exhibit non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which is involved in the breakdown of polysaccharide carbohydrates to monosaccharides (17542). The constituent delphinidin also seems to inhibit sodium-dependent glucose transport (98672). In an animal diabetic model, maqui extract reduces levels of fasting blood glucose (98672). However, in humans with impaired glucose tolerance, although a single dose of maqui extract reduces blood glucose peaks, daily consumption of maqui extract does not seem to affect fasting blood glucose (98668, 98669, 98672).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere is interest in using maqui to prevent cardiovascular disease, due to its antioxidant effects. In vitro, maqui berry juice significantly reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxidation. It also reduces intracellular oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner (17538). In humans, maqui extract reduces oxidized LDL levels in blood, as well as urinary measures of oxidation (98670). Maqui also normalizes measures of oxidative stress in the exhaled breath of smokers (98671).\nAntiplatelet effects\nMaqui extracts inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thombin-6 receptor activating peptide (TRAP-6), collagen, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The degree of activity depends on the maqui variety and extract concentration. There is a positive correlation between concentration and antiplatelet activity for the phenolic compounds isorhamnetin, quercetin, rutin, and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside (109544).\nOcular effects\nIn an animal model, maqui supplementation increased levels of delphinidin in the lachrymal glands, preventing a reduction in tear secretion (98673). Additionally, in clinical research in adults with dry eye disease, taking maqui berry extract for 2 months improves dry eye symptoms and reduces tear fluid levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) which are associated with compromised tear fluid production and increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 which may have antinociceptive effects (112981)."

It is not clear if either of these adverse effects were directly related to maritime pine bark extract.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) may cause gastrointestinal problems (15521, 15522, 17300, 50891, 50942). Also, mouth ulcer and bad breath have been reported in a single trial (15521).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) may cause dizziness and severe vertigo (15521, 15522, 17300, 50904, 50933). Also, headache has been reported in a single trial (15521).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAsthma. Oral maritime pine bark extract, taken as an adjunct to conventional asthma medications, may improve symptoms and reduce rescue inhaler use in patients with asthma.\nThree small clinical studies in children and adults with asthma of varying severity show that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 1 mg/lb body weight or 100 mg daily in addition to conventional asthma medications increases peak expiratory flow, decreases asthma symptoms, and decreases the need for rescue medications when compared with conventional therapy alone (13120, 50863, 50926). Maritime pine bark extract has not been studied as monotherapy for asthma and should not be used in place of conventional medicine for this purpose.\nless\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Oral maritime pine bark extract may improve leg pain and heaviness and reduce edema in patients with CVI.\nSeveral clinical studies in patients with CVI show that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) reduces edema, the rate of ankle swelling, and symptoms of leg pain and heaviness when used for 3-12 weeks. The most commonly used dose is 100-120 mg three times daily (2451, 2462, 2493, 7693, 50892). However, lower doses of 50 mg three times daily (16906, 50892, 50900, 50915) or 45-100 mg once daily also seem to be effective (2435, 97401). When compared with the use of below-knee compression stockings worn throughout the day, maritime pine bark reduces induration and the rate of ankle swelling when compared to baseline in patients with CVI. While both treatments reduce venous edema and pain when compared with baseline, a more pronounced reduction is seen in patients taking the maritime pine bark extract (97401). Other clinical research in adults who have had CVI for more than 3 years shows that taking the same extract, 50 mg three times daily for 8 weeks, in addition to wearing compression stockings, improves microcirculation and subjective symptom scores when compared with compression stockings alone (103616). However, compliance with the use of compression stockings in this study was poor.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral maritime pine bark extract may modestly improve symptoms and reduce the need for analgesics in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 100-150 mg daily for 3 months reduces overall osteoarthritis symptoms, pain, and the use of anti-inflammatory medication when compared with placebo (50903, 50905).\n\nTopical maritime pine bark has also been evaluated. Observational research in patients with knee osteoarthritis found that applying standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 220 mg, as two patches daily, for three weeks is associated with reduced pain and reduced need for rescue analgesics when compared with control (100356).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHyperlipidemia. Oral maritime pine bark extract may not improve lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nAlthough individual clinical trials have shown mixed results (7693, 91965, 97408), a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 100-150 mg daily for 4-24 weeks does not reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with a control (100357).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in elderly patients with age-related cognitive decline.\nOne observational registry study in healthy elderly patients ages 55-70 years has found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 100 mg daily for 12 months is associated with improved cognitive function, mental performance, and attention when compared with matched controls (97405). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study. Also, a small clinical study in healthy elderly patients 60-85 years of age shows that taking the same extract, 150 mg daily for 3 months, improves spatial working memory, but not numeric working memory, episodic memory, attention, or psychomotor performance, when compared with placebo (50906).\nless\nAging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral and topical maritime pine for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of maritime pine for this purpose.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in people with allergic rhinitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with birch allergies shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg twice daily, starting at least 5 weeks before allergy season, decreases nasal symptoms associated with birch allergies when compared with placebo (17300).\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark is beneficial for androgenic alopecia.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal patients conducted in China shows that taking maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 6 months improves hair density when compared to baseline (112713). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the placebo group.\nless\nAntidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark is beneficial for improving sexual function in adults taking escitalopram.\nA small, open-label clinical study shows that taking standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg daily for 4 months with escitalopram 10-20 mg daily seems to improve sexual dysfunction when compared with escitalopram alone (100361).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral maritime pine bark extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA non-randomized clinical trial in adults with atherosclerosis shows that taking a specific maritime pine bark product (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg and gotu kola 225 mg, in two divided doses daily for 3 months, reduces plaque height and length and increases plaque echogenicity and stability when compared to control (97030). However, these benefits may be at least partially due to gotu kola. Another non-randomized clinical study in adults with atherosclerotic plaques and no other cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking Pycnogenol 100 mg and gotu kola extract 100 mg daily for up to 4 years reduces plaque progression and increases plaque echogenicity to a greater extent than Pycnogenol alone or no treatment at all. Taking Pycnogenol with gotu kola is also associated with a reduced rate of clinical vascular events, including angina, myocardial infarction, minor transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and minor strokes, when compared with taking Pycnogenol alone or receiving no treatment at all (97029).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial for improving exercise capacity in recreationally trained adults; the available evidence is conflicting.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 200 mg orally daily for 30 days improves exercise capacity during a treadmill test in recreational athletes aged 20-35 years (2554). Additionally, an observational registry study found that taking this same maritime pine bark extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks along with training improves performance in the Army Physical Fitness Test, including reducing two-mile treadmill time by about 45-60 seconds and increasing the number of push-ups and sit-ups by about 5-7 when compared to control training alone. Taking this maritime pine bark extract during training also appears to improve total triathlon time by about 6 minutes when compared with training alone (91966). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study. Additionally, a small study in college-age males who exercise regularly shows that taking the same maritime pine bark extract 800 mg daily, starting 14 days prior to a cycle ergometer test and continuing for 2 days after, does not improve maximum oxygen consumption or power generated in the test when compared with placebo (103617).\n\nMaritime pine extract has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in non-professional athletes shows that taking a combination product (PycnoRacer, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Company) containing maritime pine extract 15 mg, L-leucine 0.6 grams, L-arginine 0.3 grams, L-isoleucine 0.3 grams, and L-valine 0.3 grams four times daily for 3 weeks during training improves running distance by about 19%, compared with 9% in athletes drinking water plus Gatorade. Maritime pine park also improved maximal oxygen consumption and reduced subjective scores of muscle pain and cramps when compared with water and Gatorade (103613). It is unclear if these benefits are due to maritime pine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in children or adults with ADHD.\nA small clinical study in adults with ADHD shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) does not seem to improve ADHD symptoms when compared with placebo (9984). However, a small clinical study in children with ADHD shows that taking this standardized maritime pine bark extract 1 mg/kg daily for one month appears to improve attention and hyperactivity scores when compared with placebo (50891).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with BPH.\nA small observational registry study in patients with BPH found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 8 weeks is associated with modest improvement of symptoms such as bladder emptying, urgency, flow, straining, and nocturia (100359). This study was limited by small size, reporting inaccuracies, and its unblinded, non-randomized design.\nless\nCognitive function. Small clinical studies suggest that oral maritime pine bark extract might improve cognitive function in healthy adults.\nA small observational registry study in healthy adults aged 30-55 years found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with slightly improved memory and cognition when compared with matched controls (97410). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study. A small clinical study in healthy college students also shows that taking the same extract 100 mg daily for 2 months seems to reduce failed tests by 4.5% and improve average test scores by about 8% when compared with control (50928).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract improves cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment.\nAn observational registry study in adults with mild cognitive impairment found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 8 weeks improves global cognitive function when compared to no supplementation. All patients in this study also received standard management of mild cognitive impairment, which included lifestyle modifications such as improved sleep, physical exercise, reduced sugar and salt intake, lowering cardiovascular risk factors, and avoiding use of stimulants or depressants (97406). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in the treatment of the common cold.\nAn observational registry study in otherwise healthy adults with a cold found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg twice daily, along with best management for colds, is associated with about one less day of a perceived cold when compared to \"best management\" alone. This standardized maritime pine bark extract is also linked to reduced use of over-the-counter products to manage symptoms in cases of colds lasting longer than 4 days (91962). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if chewing gum containing maritime pine bark extract can reduce dental plaque.\nA small clinical study shows that chewing a minimum of six pieces of gum containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 5 mg daily for 14 days reduces gingival bleeding by 55% and prevents an increase in gingival plaque when compared with a control sugar-free gum (50857).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that oral maritime pine bark extract may modestly improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nThree small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50-200 mg daily for 3-12 weeks modestly decreases blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels when compared with placebo (15521, 15522, 50908). Another small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria shows that taking a different standardized maritime pine bark extract (Oligopin, DRT Group) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces HbA1c by around 1%, but does not reduce fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo (105781).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral or topical maritime pine bark extract is beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily orally as well as applying the extract topically 100 mg daily heals ulcers in 89% of subjects compared with 61% of control subjects. Using oral or topical maritime pine bark extract alone seems to result in complete ulcer healing in about 85% of subjects (50896).\nless\nDiabetic microangiopathy. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with diabetic microangiopathy.\nA small, unblinded clinical study in patients with diabetic microangiopathy, symptoms of neuropathy, and edema in the absence of severe cardiovascular disease shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg three times daily for 4 weeks improves microcirculation (measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) and symptoms when compared with no treatment (15523).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\nA small, unblinded clinical study in patients with retinopathy due to various causes, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, or central venous thrombosis, shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg three times daily for 2 months may slow or prevent further deterioration of retinal function when compared with no treatment (2536).\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with dry mouth.\nTwo small observational studies in otherwise healthy adults or patients with diabetes suggest that adding a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) for 2 weeks along with standard saliva supplements is associated with improvement in patient-reported mouth dryness, salivary flow, and the number of small mucosal breaks when compared with saliva supplements alone. One study dosed maritime pine bark extract 150 mg orally daily and the other used a spray formulation dosed 10 mg six times daily (103612, 112714). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the studies.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with dysmenorrhea show that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 30-60 daily for up to 3 menstrual cycles reduces pain when compared to baseline (15424, 50904). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Small clinical studies suggest that oral maritime pine bark extract, taken alone or in combination with L-arginine, may modestly improve sexual function in patients with ED.\nSeveral small clinical studies in adults with ED show that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) at a dose of 120 mg daily for 3 months, either alone (12012) or in combination with L-arginine (10416, 32149, 50924), might improve sexual function when compared with placebo or baseline measurements. It seems to take up to 3 months of treatment for significant improvement. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in males with mild to moderate ED shows that taking maritime pine 80 mg with L- arginine daily for 1-6 months improves International Index of Erectile Dysfunction scores by 9 points when compared with control (112715). It is unclear if this effect is from maritime pine, L-arginine, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral maritime pine bark extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in non-professional athletes shows that taking a combination product (PycnoRacer, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Company) containing maritime pine extract 15 mg, L-leucine 0.6 grams, L-arginine 0.3 grams, L-isoleucine 0.3 grams, and L-valine 0.3 grams four times daily for 3 weeks during training improves subjective scores for muscle pain and cramps when compared with water plus Gatorade (103613). It is unclear if these benefits are due to maritime pine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral maritime pine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nOne small, unblinded clinical trial in Japanese patients with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking a specific product (Sante Glagenox, Saten Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) containing maritime pine extract 40 mg and bilberry fruit extract 90 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces intraocular pressure by 8.7% when compared to baseline (104192). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHeart failure. Oral maritime pine bark extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational study in patients with mild to moderate heart failure has found that taking a specific combination product (PycnoQ10, Natural Health Science Inc.) containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) and coenzyme Q10 for 12 weeks is associated with improved exercise capacity and heart function (44178). It is unclear if these findings are due to maritime pine, coenzyme Q10, or the combination.\nless\nHemorrhoids. It is unclear if oral or topical maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with hemorrhoids.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute hemorrhoidal episodes shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150-300 mg daily orally, alone or in combination with a cream containing 0.5% standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) for 7 days, improves both quality of life and hemorrhoidal symptoms when compared with placebo tablets/cream (50912). Additionally, an observational registry study in postpartum adults with internal or external hemorrhoids found that taking this same extract of maritime pine bark 150 mg daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard hemorrhoid care, is associated with improved symptoms, including thrombosis, pain, swelling, and bleeding, when compared to standard care alone (97416). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark reduces blood pressure; the available research is conflicting.\nA very small clinical study in patients with mild hypertension (systolic 140-159 mm Hg; diastolic 90-99 mm Hg) shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 200 mg daily for 8 weeks may modestly reduce systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with placebo (10214). Another very small study in hypertensive patients treated with ramipril, taking this same standardized maritime pine bark extract 50 mg three times daily for 6 months, appears to further reduce diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure (50913). Conflicting results have been reported with other maritime pine products. A small clinical study in adults with untreated, mild hypertension shows that taking a different standardized extract of maritime pine (Oligopin, DRT Group), 75 mg twice daily for 5 weeks, does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (97407). Also, a small clinical study in obese patients with prehypertension or hypertension shows that taking a different maritime pine bark extract (Toyo-FVG, Toyo Bio-Pharma) 200 mg daily for 12 weeks does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (50919).\n\nResults of meta-analyses are also contradictory. An analysis of 7 clinical trials using maritime pine bark extract 90-200 mg daily for 2-24 weeks shows no significant effect overall on systolic or diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, or pulse pressure (103609). However, an analysis of 12 trials using doses of 60-200 mg daily for 4-24 weeks shows a mean reduction of about 3 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, and about 2 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. There was high heterogeneity between the studies, and the effect on diastolic blood pressure was only seen with a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks (103610).\nless\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Oral maritime pine bark extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational registry study in males less than 65 years old with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia has found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg three times daily in combination with gotu kola (Centellicum; Horphag Research) 225 mg three times daily for 8 months is associated with a modest improvement in Karnofsky Performance Scale scores and a reduction in fatigue when compared with pirfenidone (108862). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with IBS.\nAn observational registry study in adults with idiopathic IBS found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 4 weeks, in conjunction with standard treatment, is associated with reduced abdominal pain, cramps, and the use of medical care and rescue medications when compared to standard treatment alone. In both groups, standard treatment included specific nutritional recommendations and Buscopan Compositum, hyoscine-N-butylbromide, or acetaminophen for pain relief (97402). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nJet lag. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract can prevent or treat jet leg.\nAn observational registry study found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for up to 10 days, starting 3 days before a plane flight, is associated with reduced signs and symptoms of jet lag when compared to control (97437). Additionally, a small clinical study shows that taking this extract 50 mg three times daily for 7 days, starting 2 days before a plane flight, reduces jet lag symptoms and the average duration of symptoms by a little over 1 day when compared with placebo (97412).\nless\nLeg cramps. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial for leg cramps.\nA small clinical study in patients experiencing at least 4 episodes of leg cramps per week associated with athletic activity, venous insufficiency, or an unknown cause shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 200 mg daily for 4 weeks may decrease the incidence of leg cramps when compared to baseline (15524). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMale infertility. Although there has been interest in using oral maritime pine for male infertility, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of maritime pine for this purpose.\nMelasma. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial for melasma.\nA small clinical study in females with melasma shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 75 mg twice daily for 60 days, along with topical application of sunscreen during the day and a triple cream containing hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone at night, improves scores related to melasma severity and aesthetics, but not quality of life, when compared with placebo plus sunscreen and triple cream (105782).\nless\nMeniere disease. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with Meniere disease.\nObservational registry research in patients with Meniere disease found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily along with standard treatment is associated with a greater reduction in the severity of tinnitus and the number of work-days lost when compared with standard treatment alone. After 6 months of treatment, about 87% of patients taking maritime pine bark were asymptomatic, compared to about 35% of patients receiving standard treatment alone (97413). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Small clinical studies suggest that oral maritime pine bark extract might improve some menopausal symptoms.\nSeveral small clinical studies in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 60-200 mg daily for 2-6 months modestly reduces perimenopausal symptoms, including tiredness, headache, depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and loss of memory, when compared with placebo or control (14899, 50927, 50945).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg three times daily for 6 months lowers triglyceride levels by 46 mg/dL, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by about 10 mg/dL, reduces fasting plasma glucose by 18 mg/dL, and lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 7 mmHg and 5 mmHg, respectively, when compared to baseline. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to a control group. Taking the maritime pine bark extract was also associated with a reduction in the percentage of patients presenting with five risk factors of metabolic syndrome (91960).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if topical maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in children with chemotherapy-related oral mucositis.\nA small clinical study in children 6-15 years of age with chemotherapy-related oral mucositis shows that application of a solution containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 1 mg/kg in three divided doses daily for one week promotes complete healing in 58% of patients and improved healing in 38% of patients. This improvement was significantly greater than treatment with glycerine solution and similar to treatment with vitamin E solution (91964).\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with osteopenia.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Oligopin, DRT Group) 150 mg daily for 12 weeks improves markers of bone turnover when compared with placebo (105783). It is unknown if maritime pine bark extract improves bone mineral density or reduces the risk of fractures in patients with osteopenia.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with Parkinson disease.\nTwo small observational studies in adults with mild to moderate Parkinson disease suggest that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 4 or 8 weeks in conjunction with carbidopa/levodopa therapy is associated with a reduction in scores for tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity when compared with carbidopa/levodopa therapy alone. Maritime pine is also associated with an increase in the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score from approximately 75 (cares for self, unable to carry on normal activity or do active work) to approximately 85 (normal activity with effort, some signs or symptoms of disease), compared with little to no change from a score of around 75 in the control group (103614, 112716).\nless\nPregnancy-related pain. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial for reducing pain during the third trimester of pregnancy.\nA small clinical study in patients in the third trimester of pregnancy shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 30 mg daily modestly reduces lower back pain, hip joint pain, pelvic pain, and pain due to varicose veins or calf cramps when compared with a control group (15423).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with psoriasis.\nAn observational registry study in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 12 weeks along with standard treatment is associated with improved quality of life, increased water and moisture content of the skin, reduced plaque severity and total affected body area, and reduced use of corticosteroids when compared with standard treatment alone (97417). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with Raynaud syndrome.\nA small clinical study in females with mild, primary Raynaud syndrome shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks decreases coldness, burning pain, paresthesias, skin color changes, and low temperature areas of the hands when compared with lifestyle changes alone. The lowest finger temperature increased by 30% in those taking this product, compared with 13% in those implementing lifestyle changes alone (103615).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral maritime pine is beneficial for RLS.\nA small observational study in adults with RLS suggests that taking maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily along with standard management (i.e., regular sleep, exercise, vitamin C, B vitamins, proper footwear, and instruction on diet and posture) improves self-reported symptoms associated with RLS when compared to baseline. Maritime pine bark may also be associated with less analgesic use compared with standard management alone (112717). However, the interpretation of these findings, other than analgesic use, is limited by lack of a statistical comparison to the other study group.\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with sarcopenia.\nObservational registry research in adults over 70 years of age with signs of muscle loss has found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily along with strength training for 2 months improves hand grip strength, walking distance, total weight lifted, number of steps climbed, and general fitness scores when compared with strength training alone (97404). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nSexual dysfunction. Oral maritime pine bark extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with sexual dysfunction shows that taking a specific combination tablet (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research) containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 20 mg, L-arginine 200 mg, L-citrulline 200 mg, and a standardized rose hip extract (Rosvita) orally 50 mg daily for 8 weeks, in combination with a management program consisting of lifestyle, diet, exercise, and stress control changes, improves overall sexual function when compared with the management program alone (91963). Taking the same product in a dose of 2 tablets twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to the lifestyle management program, improves vaginal dryness in pre- and post-menopausal patients when compared with lifestyle management alone (103611). The effect of maritime pine alone on sexual dysfunction is unclear.\nless\nSjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with Sjogren syndrome.\nA very small observational study in patients with Sjogren syndrome found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily in addition to standard therapy is associated with a reduction in dry eye, dry mouth, and the need for corticosteroids when compared with standard therapy alone (100360).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with SLE.\nA very small clinical study in adults with SLE shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 120 mg daily for 30 days, followed by 60 mg daily for 30 days, modestly reduces symptoms of SLE in some patients when compared with control (50851).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with TBI.\nA clinical study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with TBI shows that administering a standardized maritime pine bark extract (Oligopin, DRT Group) 50 mg three times daily with enteral nutrition for 10 days improves scores on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and APACHE II [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II], as well as nutritional status, when compared with placebo. At day 28, survival rate was 86% in the treatment group, compared to 71% in the placebo group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (108861).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with recurrent UTIs or interstitial cystitis.\nAn observational registry study in adults aged 30-40 years with a recent history of recurrent UTIs has found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 2 months is associated with a normal urinalysis in 92% of patients, compared with 68% of those who received no supplementation (108860). Another observational registry study in patients with recurrent UTIs or interstitial cystitis has found that taking this same dose for 2 months is associated with a normal urinalysis in 100% of patients, compared with 35% of patients who took oral cranberry extract 400 mg daily and 36% of those who received no treatment (108859). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of these studies.\nless\nVaricose veins. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with varicose veins.\nObservational registry research in postpartum adults has found that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg daily for 6 months, in addition to using below-knee compression stockings, is associated with reduced edema, leg cramps, total number of varicose veins, and number of visible spider vein clusters when compared with compression stockings alone (97403). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). While some conflicting evidence exists, low-quality clinical research suggests that oral maritime pine bark extract might prevent superficial thrombosis during flights and reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nObservational registry research has found that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 10 days is not associated with reduced occurrence of DVT, a type of VTE, when compared with compression stockings or control (97437). However, an older clinical study in patients at moderate or high risk for thrombotic events shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 200 mg 2-3 hours before a flight seems to reduce superficial thrombosis, but not DVT risk, when compared with placebo (50874). Some observational research also has also found that taking standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is associated with reduced post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent DVT (100355). Also, some clinical research shows that taking standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) daily for one year, while wearing or not wearing compression stockings, reduces the incidence of PTS in patients with a single prior episode of DVT (50925).\n\nMaritime bark has also been studied in combination with other natural products. There is some evidence that taking a specific combination product (Flite Tabs, Aidan Products) before a flight and then again 6 hours later might decrease the risk of DVT during long-haul plane flights in high-risk patients. The product combines a blend of 150 mg of standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) plus nattokinase (12075).\nless\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract can reduce wrinkles or improve skin health in people with significant sun exposure.\nA small crossover study in Chinese adults working outdoors shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves skin hydration and reduces transepidermal water loss and skin darkening when compared with placebo (105784).\nless\nBehcet syndrome. It is unclear if oral maritime pine bark extract is beneficial in patients with Behcet syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with Behcet syndrome shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 3 weeks reduces skin ulcer size and improves self-reported symptoms of burning and pain when compared to baseline (100358). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate maritime pine for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with maritime pine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing a single oral intake of a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research), at least five known constituents can be detected in plasma starting within 30 minutes of ingestion. These constituents include catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, taxifolin, and M1 (delta-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-gamma-valerolactone) (50894). Topical application of this same extract of maritime pine bark to ex-vivo human skin results in the absorption of detectable quantities of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, catechin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillin (97409).\nMetabolism\nConstituents of maritime pine bark extract are metabolized through glucuronide and sulfate conjugation (2431, 2543, 10212, 50894).\nExcretion\nFerulic acid and taxifolin conjugates of a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) are excreted in the urine within 18-24 hours. Conjugated metabolites of the procyanidin fraction are excreted within 28-34 hours (2431, 2543, 10212).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of maritime pine is the bark. Pycnogenol is the US registered trademark for a specific extract derived from maritime pine bark (2431, 2641). Pycnogenol contains several active constituents including flavonoid monomers such as catechin, epicatechin, and taxifolin. It also contains condensed procyanidins (also called flavonoids or proanthocyanidins) such as procyanidin B1, B3, B6, and B7 which are dimers, oligomers, and polymers of catechin and epicatechin (2431, 2433). Pycnogenol also contains phenolic acids including gallic, ferulic, caffeic, vanillic, p-coumaric, protocatechuic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acids, and their glucosides and glucose esters (2431, 2433, 2435, 2543).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nVarious studies have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of maritime pine bark extract. In humans, a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) has been shown to inhibit NF-kappa activation (50889), inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activity (50888), and reduce C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (50907, 108863). Other clinical research shows that taking this specific extract decreases erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and reduces interleukin (IL)-6 (108863). Animal research suggests that this extract can reduce myeloperoxidase activity in rats with inflammatory bowel disease (50879). In vitro research shows that the standardized maritime pine bark extract may also reduce the production of IL-1 and IL-2 (50848, 50853). However, other research suggests that this extract does not affect levels of various inflammatory markers including CRP, IL-1, or IL-6 (7694). Human research in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with a traumatic brain injury shows that receiving a different standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Oligopin, DRT Group) reduces levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta and CRP after 10 days when compared with placebo (108861).\nAntiallergic effects\nSome clinical research shows that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) can improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (17300). Preliminary research from animal models suggests that this effect may result from the ability of this extract to inhibit histamine release from mast cells; the effect is comparable to sodium cromoglycate (50862). Other evidence suggests that the antiallergic effects of this extract stem from its anti-inflammatory potential. Ex vivo research shows that this standardized maritime pine bark extract can inhibit lipooxygenase, leukotriene, and cyclooxygenase release from neutrophils (17300).\nAntiarthritic effects\nFor arthritis, a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is thought to be beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In patients with osteoarthritis, this maritime pine bark extract was shown to reduce C-reactive protein levels (50907).\nAntiasthmatic effects\nFor asthma, a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is thought to be beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In children with asthma taking this maritime pine bark extract decreases urinary levels of leukotrienes compared to placebo (13120).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) can cause differentiation and apoptosis in leukemia and breast cancer cells (50847, 50882). Also, evidence from animal research shows that this extract can protect against the toxicity and mutagenicity of chronic cigarette smoke exposure by up to 48%. The effect has been attributed to the antioxidant effects of the maritime pine bark extract (50866). In particular, in vitro research shows that the standardized extract of maritime pine bark can inhibit the metabolic activation of NNK, a tobacco-specific nitrosamine that plays a role in the carcinogenicity of tobacco (50835, 50836).\nAntidiabetic effects\nFor lowering blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, the mechanism is unclear, but a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) does not seem to have an effect on insulin secretion (15522). Evidence from animal research suggests that the antidiabetic effects of this standardized maritime pine bark extract relate to its ability to reduce oxidative stress (50864, 50877). Oxidative stress is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and contribute to diabetes-related complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (91958, 91959).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) can inhibit the growth of various strains of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, yeast, and fungi (50885). Also, this extract appears to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Aeromonas hydrophila bacteria in raw and cooked ground beef, suggesting it has potential use as a food preservative (50868, 50895).\nAntioxidant effects\nA standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) contains constituents with antioxidant effects, including the ability to recycle ascorbyl and tocopheryl radicals, helping to maintain vitamin C and E levels. These effects are thought to help prevent capillary permeability in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, to help improve athletic performance, and to help prevent retinopathy (2433, 2435, 2636, 2542, 2451, 2554, 7698). Also, evidence from animal research suggests that the antidiabetic effects of this extract relate to its ability to reduce oxidative stress in diabetic rats (50864, 50877, 50878). In vitro research has also shown that the standardized extract of maritime pine bark can inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophage cells (50940). The ability of this extract to protect DNA from radical-induced damage is controversial. Some in vitro research suggests that it protects DNA from damage by radicals (50875, 50876). However, other research suggests that it does not protect DNA from radical damage nor does it improve the ability of DNA to repair itself (50922).\nAntispasmodic effects\nFor pelvic pain, preliminary research suggests the ferulic acid and caffeic acid constituents of a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) have antispasmodic effects and can inhibit uterine contractions (15424).\nAntiviral effects\nA standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) has demonstrated antiviral activity in myocardial and liver cells. In mice infected with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, maritime pine bark suppresses viral replication and reduces the extent of myocardial infiltration and necrosis (97411). In vitro research shows that maritime pine bark extract also suppresses the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in mouse liver cells. Combining maritime pine bark extract with ribavirin and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), or with telaprevir, enhances the suppression of HCV replication. Two constituents of maritime pine, procyanidin and taxifolin, did not suppress replication of HCV, indicating that the antiviral activity of maritime pine derives from other constituents (97418).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn chronic venous insufficiency, procyanidins in a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) reduce capillary permeability, which contributes to edema and microbleeding, by cross-linking capillary wall proteins such as collagen and elastin (2435, 2544). There is also some evidence that procyanidins make elastin more resistant to degradation by elastase (2451, 2635), and that this extract might inhibit elastase and collagenase released by activated macrophages (2462). The standardized extract of maritime pine bark might also help prevent capillary permeability due to the antioxidant effects of several of its constituents (2433, 2435, 2636, 2542, 2451). The extract also seems to recycle ascorbyl and tocopheryl radicals, helping to maintain vitamin C and E levels, which is thought to help protect endothelial cells, improve vasorelaxation, and strengthen capillary and vascular integrity (2542, 7698). In humans with chronic venous insufficiency, taking the standardized maritime pine bark extract seems to improve the recovery of venous segments after ex vivo stretching and reduce passive dilation. This suggests that the extract helps improve the elasticity and tone of vein walls in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (91961). A small observational study in adults with restless legs syndrome suggests that taking maritime pine bark extract may improve positional limb blood flow (i.e., venoarteriolar reflex) measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (112717).\n\nSome research suggests that standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) might be useful in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. In vitro, this extract prevents oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and protects DNA from damage by free radicals (2433). It also seems to prevent free-radical induced endothelial damage in vitro (2433). In addition, in vitro research shows that the extract can reduce the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (50846). This suggests that standardized maritime pine bark extract may help prevent atherogenic processes. The standardized maritime pine bark extract inhibits epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, such as that seen in smokers (2435, 3285), but it does not appear to increase bleeding risk or affect smoking-related increases in blood pressure or heart rate (3283). In non-smokers, it decreases serum thromboxane B2 and reduces systolic blood pressure (10214). The extract inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro, but is unlikely to have clinically significant hypotensive effects when used orally in humans (2435). The standardized maritime pine bark extract might also increase production of nitric oxide from vascular endothelial cells by stimulating nitric oxide synthetase. This can lead to vasodilatation and possibly reduce the potential for atherogenesis and thrombus formation (2433, 2451, 2545, 2637, 50923). In human studies, taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) for 30 months attenuated atherosclerotic plaque progression in healthy asymptomatic adults with non-stenosing plaques (97415). Increased nitric oxide production might also be the mechanism for the possible benefit of the extract in erectile dysfunction (10416, 12012), hypertension (16906), and sexual enjoyment in peri-menopausal women (14899). Increased nitric oxide might also play a role in reducing vasomotor symptoms in peri-menopausal women.\nCoagulation effects\nA standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) inhibits epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, such as that seen in smokers (2435, 3285). This effect is attributed to the ability of the extract to lower thromboxane B2 levels in smokers (50844). However, the extract does not appear to lower TxB2 levels in nonsmokers, nor does it appear to increase bleeding risk (3283, 50844).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) to protect against sunburn. Skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation has been shown to increase levels of free radicals that can damage the skin. It is theorized that the extract may counteract the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation through its antioxidant effects. Oral supplementation with the standardized maritime pine bark extract at doses of 1.10 mg/kg/day for four weeks followed by 1.66 mg/kg/day for an additional 4 weeks increases the amount of ultraviolet radiation, both UVA and UVB, required to cause erythema and pinkness of the skin in human volunteers. The higher dose appears more protective than the lower dose, since a greater amount of ultraviolet radiation is required to cause erythema when the higher dose is taken (7696).\n\nSome research suggests that topical maritime pine bark extract might be useful for skin diseases related to increased cell adhesion and inflammation such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and lupus erythematosus. Preclinical research suggests that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) reduces inflammation in keratinocytes (10213). Research in animal models of wound healing suggests that gel formulations containing 1%, 2%, and 5% extract reduce wound healing time in a concentration-dependent manner. Researchers theorize that the standardized maritime pine bark extract might bind to collagen and elastin in wounds and inhibit the activity of metalloproteinases, which can slow wound healing (15422).\n\nThere is also interest in the effects of maritime pine bark on scalp circulation. A small clinical study in menopausal females shows that taking maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 150 mg daily for 6 months increases peripheral microcirculation of blood at the scalp when compared to baseline (112713). However, interpretation of this finding is limited by lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group.\nErgogenic effects\nTaking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) while training for exercise tests or a triathlon appears to improve performance during the tests/competitions compared to training alone. This effect has been attributed to the ability of the extract to reduce oxidative stress (91966). In adults over 70 years of age, taking this standardized extract of maritime pine bark improves muscle function and measurably reduces oxidative stress (97404).\nHematologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that a standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) can inhibit the formation of dense cells. Dense cells adhere to neutrophils, platelets, and vascular endothelial cells and have the potential to cause vaso-occlusion in patients with sickle cell anemia (5056). Also, a small clinical study in patients with tinnitus shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 100-150 mg daily for approximately 34 days improves cochlear arterial blood flow (50917).\nHepatic effects\nThere is developing interest in using maritime pine as a hepatoprotective agent. In vitro research shows that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) facilitates degradation of PLIN2 mRNA in mouse liver cells. PLIN2 is present in high quantities in fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis and is associated with hepatic lipid accumulation (97414).\nImmunostimulant effects\nLaboratory research shows that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) might stimulate the immune system. It seems to boost natural killer cell activity (2435) and improve T- and B-cell function in animal models (2636). This standardized extract also increases tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion and nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) activity (7697). The standardized maritime pine bark extract appears to slow the development of immune dysfunction in animal models infected with a retrovirus similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by restoring imbalanced T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 cytokine secretion (7695).\n\nIn immunosuppressed animals infected with Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan that causes intestinal tract infection, a standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) appears to increase oocyst shedding, although it does not appear to reduce tissue colonization (50852).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nA standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) might have some activity in Alzheimer disease. In vitro, the extract protects animal brain cells from the toxic effects of high levels of glutamate, and also from the toxic effects of amyloid-beta-protein, which is found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer disease (2435, 7699, 50840, 50855). This protective potential has been attributed to the antioxidant effects of maritime pine bark extract (50855). In clinical research of healthy adults with high oxidative stress, this standardized maritime pine bark extract measurably reduces oxidative stress and improves cognitive function (97405, 97410).\n\nFor attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), maritime pine bark is thought to be beneficial due to its antioxidant effects. In children with ADHD, the standardized maritime pine bark extract has been shown to increase reduced glutathione levels, reduce oxidized glutathione levels, reduce oxidative damage to DNA, and improve total antioxidant status, as well as normalize urinary catecholamine concentrations and decrease dopamine concentrations (50898, 50899, 50902).\nRenal effects\nMaritime pine bark extract is reported to improve renal cortical blood flow and reduce urinary albumin excretion (103609). It is also reported to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (103609).\nSexual function enhancement\nPreliminary research shows that taking a combination product containing standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research), L-arginine, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research, Geneva, Switzerland) improves sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction. This effect has been attributed to the ability of the combination product to decrease oxidative stress.\nWeight loss effects\nThere is a developing interest in using a standardized extract of maritime pine bark to prevent obesity. In vitro, the extract appears to inhibit insulin-induced lipogenesis and may stimulate lipolysis (8307, 50839, 50880)."

The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 4.1% with marjoram compared to 2.7% with control. While these improvements were statistically significant compared to baseline, statistical analysis between groups was lacking (76944).\nDysmenorrhea. Preliminary clinical research in women aged 19-45 years with primary dysmenorrhea shows that massaging the lower abdomen with a cream containing lavender, clary sage, and marjoram essential oils (2:1:1 ratio) diluted in unscented jojoba cream to a 3% concentration, in a dose of two grams daily, starting at the end of menstruation and continuing until the beginning of the next, might decrease the level and duration of pain when compared with a placebo cream containing synthetic fragrances. The decrease in pain duration, from 2.4 days to 1.8 days in the essential oils group, was statistically significant when compared to baseline (58095). It is unclear if these effects are due to marjoram, other ingredients, or the combination.\nParkinson disease. Preliminary clinical research in patients with Parkinson disease who are stabilized on levodopa shows that drinking a tea containing 5 grams of dried marjoram leaf daily for 30 days does not lower Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III motor scores (USPDRSIII), but does decrease scores on the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), when compared with placebo tea (108498).\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Preliminary clinical research shows that drinking marjoram leaf tea 250 mL twice daily for 1 month modestly reduces levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and insulin in women with PCOS.

            "Overdose": "Arbutin, also known as hydroquinone-beta-D-glucopyranoside or 4-hydroxyphenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, is present in marjoram extracts in variable amounts depending on the source. A preparation of the dried, ground herb contained a mean of 35.2-62.4 mg arbutin per gram. Samples of marjoram available commercially for culinary use contained 1.9-40.4 mg arbutin per gram (95524). There is concern that hydroquinone and other metabolites released from arbutin in the colon may have toxic effects, although the amount of marjoram that would need to be ingested to produce toxicity is unknown. These metabolites have hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects in animal studies (76935, 95524).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of marjoram.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of marjoram are the leaves and flowers and the essential oil distilled from these parts (11). Constituents of marjoram include terpinenes, p-cymene, 4-terpineol, terpinolene, sabinene, linalool, beta-caryophylline, borneol, carvachrol, sabinene, linalyl acetate, ocimene, cadinene, alpha-pinene, geranyl acetate, citral, estragole, eugenol, 3-carene, flavonoid glycosides, arbutin, tannins, carnosol, caffeic acid, labiatic acid, carnosic acid, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, coumarinic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, rutin, catechin, hydroquinone, steroids including beta-sitosterol, flavonoids, triterpenoids, quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol glycosides, and vitamins A and C (11, 76916, 76922, 76926, 76933, 95324, 108497, 108498).\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity\nMarjoram herb extracts and essential oil are reported to have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro (31438, 76912). Constituents thought to be responsible for this activity include ursolic acid and alpha-pinene (31438, 76912, 95324).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSabinene hydrate and terpineol present in marjoram essential oil suppress production of several inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta), IL-6, and IL-10. The essential oil also inhibits COX-2 and NF-kappa-B gene expression (95324).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that a marjoram extract has agonist activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), improving insulin sensitivity (38442, 95325). Constituents thought to be responsible for this activity include rosemarinic acid, luteolin, and hydroquinone glycosides (95323).\nAntimicrobial effects\nA methanol extract of marjoram has activity in vitro against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. It also has activity against several fungi including Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans (76928, 95324). A marjoram extract has also been reported to have activity against Sporothrix brasiliensis, the fungus causing sporotrichosis (95521).\nAntioxidant effects\nAqueous extracts of marjoram herb and essential oil have antioxidant activity that is thought to be due to flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acid, ursolic acid, carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid (30627, 59327, 76913, 76936, 95324),\nAntiplatelet effects\nA methanol extract of marjoram leaves inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, collagen, and thrombin. This activity is associated with the arbutin constituent (76932, 95324, 95522).\nAntiviral effects\nAn aqueous extract of marjoram herb had in vitro activity against the herpes simplex virus (11, 18).\nCardiac effects\nIn isolated rat hearts, perfusion with an extract of dried marjoram leaves reduces myocardial damage after ischemia-reperfusion, possibly by dilating coronary arteries and increasing antioxidant activity in the myocardium, leading to reduced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. The extract also reduces the contractile response to the vasoconstrictor norepinephrine in an isolated aorta preparation (108499).\nDermatological effects\nArbutin isolated from marjoram extracts, and its metabolite hydroquinone, have skin-lightening effects as a result of reduced melanin formation in melanocytes, due to inhibition of tyrosinase (76935).\nGastroprotective effects\nAn ethanol extract of marjoram decreased gastric acid secretion and the incidence of experimentally induced ulcers in animals (76934, 95324).\nPsychiatric effects\nIn an animal model of depression, research shows that giving a polyphenol extract of marjoram leaves in a dose of 50-100 mg/kg orally daily for 21 days decreases depression scores when compared with untreated controls. Score reductions were similar to those seen with paroxetine 11.5 mg/kg daily (108497)."

At 30 days, the marshmallow intervention also results in fewer positive yeast cultures and sustained reduction in itching (112371). However, the validity of these results is limited by significant differences between groups at baseline for dyspareunia and dysuria, and lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons which can increase false positive findings. Additionally, all primary outcomes were patient-reported.\nless\nVenous leg ulcers.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMarshmallow mucilage is not altered in the digestive tract until it reaches the colon, where it may be partially or completely digested via bacterial action (62029).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of marshmallow are the leaves and the root. Marshmallow root preparations consist of peeled or unpeeled dried root of Althaea officinalis L. and contain mucilage polysaccharides (6.2-11.6%) composed of galacturonorhamnans, arabinans, glucaris, and arabinogalactans; carbohydrates (25-35%); flavonoids; glycosides; sugars (10% sucrose); amines (up to 12% asparagines); fat (1.7%); calcium oxalate; coumarins; phenolic acid (62031); and sterols. The mucilage rich roots are thought to be responsible for many of the pharmacological effects of marshmallow (92846). Purified homogenous mucilage of marshmallow is composed of L-rhamnose, D-galactose, galacturonic acid, and D-glucuronic acid in molar ratio of 3:2:3:3 (62022). Extracts from hybrid plants have been found to be more mucilaginous, with a different sugar composition compared to native plants (62023). The roots are also high in pectin which has reported pharmacological effects. Different colored flower petals have been tested for their flavonoid content. The highest flavonoid content was found in the white petals, followed by reddish pink, and then pink (92844). Additionally, the leaf includes mucilage, polysaccharide, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, and fat (92845).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in the effects of marshmallow on cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways. A study in carcinogen-induced rats suggests that marshmallow flower extract reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and AKT protein expression when compared with control, but does not affect several other markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis except when in combination with silymarin (112374).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that marshmallow has anti-inflammatory effects. Marshmallow root extract may stimulate phagocytosis and the release of oxygen radicals and leukotrienes from human neutrophils. Additionally, marshmallow aqueous extract may induce the release of cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from human monocytes (62033, 92845). An experimental study found that the anti-inflammatory properties of marshmallow alone were superior to dexamethasone monotherapy in rabbits (62026). In animal models of inflammation, intraperitoneal injections of marshmallow extract inhibited acute inflammation by 41-78% and inhibited chronic inflammation by 52-68%, with the optimum dose of 250 mg/kg showing similar inhibitory activity to diclofenac 10 mg/kg body weight. The anti-inflammatory effects are thought to be due to the presence of flavonoids which decrease the release of inflammatory mediators, stabilize cell membranes, and inhibit cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. Mucilage may also possess anti-inflammatory properties (92846). However, a study in carcinogen-induced rats suggests that marshmallow flower extract does not significantly reduce cytokine levels (i.e., IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF-alpha), but may decrease C-reactive protein levels when compared with control (112374).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that marshmallow has antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus. But not all laboratory research has shown marshmallow to have Gram negative activity (92847). Some animal research suggests that marshmallow's antimicrobial effects may be explained by suppression of mucociliary action and stimulation of phagocytosis (31530, 62028). In an animal wound model, a hydroethanolic leaf extract of marshmallow showed increased epithelization of wound tissue compared to placebo, but no significant difference was seen when compared to zinc oxide. Scar area was smaller and the epidermis formation was intact in both the zinc and extract treated groups. The researchers suggest that antimicrobial effects of the extract may have contributed to the healing process. The active constituents in the extract may also increase the viability and strength of collagen fibrils. This is thought to be accomplished by increasing circulation or by preventing cell damage or promoting DNA synthesis. Flavonoids may possess anti-hemorrhage properties which may promote and accelerate the healing processes of epithelial wounds (92847).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of marshmallow flowers vary depending on flower color. Marshmallow extracts made from reddish pink flowers possess higher antioxidant activity compared to extracts made from white or pink flowers (92844). A study in carcinogen-induced rats suggests that marshmallow flower extract improves antioxidant enzyme levels by reducing nitric oxide and increasing glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase but does not significantly affect catalase enzyme levels when compared with control. Liver tissue-specific antioxidants (i.e., ferric reducing ability, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, thiol) also improved when compared with control (112374).\nAntiplatelet effects\nSome animal research suggests that marshmallow extract inhibits platelet aggregation. The inhibitory effect ranged from 17.9-72% and was time-dependent. Researchers suggest that flavonoids from marshmallow might inhibit platelet function through binding to the thromboxane A2 receptors (92846).\nAntitussive/mucociliary effects\nAnimal research shows that mucilaginous herbs like marshmallow root can inhibit coughing by forming a protective coating on the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract, shielding it from irritants (31530, 62030). Marshmallow reduced the transport velocity of isolated ciliary epithelia and may protect mucous layers in the hypopharynx and exert spasmolytic, antisecretory, and bactericidal properties (31530). Marshmallow root extract and a marshmallow polysaccharide have demonstrated greater antitussive activity than a non-narcotic cough suppressant in cats (62021). The extract seems to be less effective than marshmallow polysaccharide (62029). The demulcent properties of marshmallow may be due to the reduction of the local irritation that causes gastritis.\nDermatologic effects\nCombinations of marshmallow preparations with steroids have been used in the management of dermatological conditions, and the plant appears to possess anti-inflammatory activity that potentiates the effect of topical steroids (62024, 62025). In vitro, the anti-inflammatory effects of an ointment containing marshmallow extract and dexamethasone (0.05%) were superior to those of the individual ingredients in the alleviation of chemically induced rabbit ear irritation (62026).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn a gastric ulcer induced animal model, an extract of marshmallow showed dose-dependent protection against ulceration. High dose extract was superior to cimetidine. Researchers suggest that mucilage and flavonoids from marshmallow may form a protective layer over the gastric mucosa (1, 4, 6, 7, 18, 92846).\nHepatic effects\nSome animal research suggests that a marshmallow flower extract might have hepatoprotective effects (92846). A study in carcinogen-induced rats suggests that marshmallow flower extract improves liver laboratory markers by decreasing aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin when compared with control (112374).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAnimal research suggests that marshmallow might reduce plasma glucose levels, theoretically due to its fiber-containing mucilage (62022).\nHypolipidemic effects\nSome animal research shows that a marshmallow flower extract can significantly increase high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in rats. The researchers suggest that this effect is due to pectin. The increase in HDL was only observed at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily. Doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg daily did not appear to increase HDL levels. It is unclear why higher doses didn't increase HDL, but the researchers speculate it may be secondary to higher concentrations of certain components antagonizing the effects of pectin (92846)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of mastic is the resin. Mastic resin contains the triterpenes mastihadienonic acid and isomastihadienonic acid, oleanolic acid, and tirucallol (18, 99987). The volatile oil of mastic contains alpha-pinene and beta-myrcene (62038).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of mastic possibly play a role in its various clinical effects. In animal models, mastic gum had anti-inflammatory effects related to edema, asthma, and allergic contact dermatitis (62078, 62080, 108885). The reduction in inflammation is related to reduced inflammatory cytokines and enzymes and reduced activity of neutrophils and eosinophils (62059, 62065, 62078, 62080, 62087, 108885). In a rat model of colitis, rectally administered mastic oil was associated with reductions in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels and increases in interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (106472). In a mouse model of colitis, orally administered aqueous extract of mastic leaf was associated with dose-dependent reductions in systemic, local, and peritoneal macrophage levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and nitrites (106475). However, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with abdominal obesity and at least 1 other metabolic syndrome risk factor shows that taking mastic essential oil 200 mg once daily for 3 months does not improve TNF-alpha, IL-6, or C-reactive protein levels when compared with control (112904).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThere is interest in the effects of mastic on hormones related to obesity. A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with abdominal obesity and at least 1 other metabolic syndrome risk factor shows that taking mastic essential oil 200 mg once daily for 3 months improves adiponectin levels but does not improve leptin levels when compared with control (112904). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited clinically, since leptin resistance was not assessed.\nAnticancer effects\nMastic gum has been traditionally used for cancer. Tumor growth is reduced in animal models (62061, 62068). This effect might be due to increased apoptosis and reduced neovascularization. Cellular signaling is also affected (62042, 62044, 62053, 62068, 62072, 62073).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThere is some in vitro evidence that mastic extract has antibacterial and antifungal activity (4141, 62035, 62039, 62043, 62055). Also, in humans, chewing mastic gum has antibacterial effects in the mouth (62036, 62039, 62046). Mastic gum also has antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori (62048, 62069).\nBone effects\nAnimal research suggests that mastic might protect against bone loss. In a rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, mastic powder minimized reductions in bone mineral density caused by ovary removal. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects are purported to explain any effect on bone metabolism (108884).\nGastrointestinal effects\nFor prevention of gastric and duodenal ulcers, some researchers think mastic might have antisecretory and possibly cytoprotective effects. Animal models show that it seems to help protect the gastric mucosa during aspirin, phenylbutazone, or reserpine therapy (4142). This effect has not yet been found in humans. Mastic gum has antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori (62048, 62069). In a rat model of colitis, orally administered mastic oil was associated with improvements in the severity and extent of inflammation, as well as reductions in crypt damage and total colitis index scores (106472). Research in colitis-induced mice suggests that orally administering high and low doses of mastic as an aqueous extract or as masticadieonic acid, a specific constituent of mastic, may improve disease activity index scores, inflammation, histology, and mucus production (106475, 112907).\n\nSome research in humans suggests that mastic helps to reduce symptoms of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (62051). Animal and human research suggests that this benefit may have been due to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines (62051, 62086, 112907). In humans, taking mastic resulted in a decrease in fecal lysozyme (99987).\nLipid effects\nIn people with inflammatory bowel disease, taking mastic improved the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (99986). In human research, mastic powder decreased levels of LDL cholesterol (62050)."

Flavonoids include catechins and quercetin derivates, including spiraeoside, isoquercitrin, and rutoside (7, 12, 62100, 62102, 101059, 112302). The distribution of the different phenolic compounds is highly variable across the various parts of the plant. The highest levels are found in the leaves, flowers, and fruit, with slightly lower levels found in the roots and much lower levels found in the stems. The one exception is catechins, which are found in the highest concentration in the roots.\nAnti-gout effects\nIn vitro, a methanolic extract of meadowsweet aerial parts has demonstrated xanthine oxidase activity. Fractionation and purification of the methanolic extract revealed that spiraeoside, a glycosylated flavonoid constituenttion of meadowsweet, possesses xanthine oxidase activity approximately 25 times that of allopurinol (106707).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMeadowsweet is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent. In animal research, meadowsweet inhibited inflammation. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzyme activities seems to play a role in this inhibition (101059). In vitro research found extracts of the meadowsweet flowering tops to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in a dose-dependent manner (112303).\nAntimicrobial effects\nMeadowsweet is traditionally used for bladder infections. Laboratory research suggests that meadowsweet has mild urinary antiseptic and antibacterial effects (4, 62098). In vitro research found extracts from the flowers and fruit of meadowsweet to exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (112302).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe leaves, flowers, fruit, and roots of meadowsweet have been found to demonstrate antioxidant activity in vitro (112302).\nAntiulcerogenic effects\nMeadowsweet is traditionally used for dyspepsia, heartburn, and peptic ulcer disease. In laboratory research, meadowsweet has demonstrated antacid activity (4)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are fat molecules containing three medium chain saturated fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone (93730, 93731, 93734, 93736). MCTs are sometimes consumed to induce ketosis. MCTs are more efficiently metabolized into ketones than other forms of fat, thereby allowing for the consumption of less fat and more carbohydrates than classical diets intended to induce ketosis (96973, 96979, 98417). See the Ketogenic Diet for more information about the safety and efficacy of various dietary patterns that induce ketosis.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (11726, 11727, 11728, 11729, 11730, 93729). ...when used parenterally and appropriately (2275, 2276, 2278, 11726, 11727, 11728, 11729).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of MCTs when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, MCTs can cause significant gastrointestinal upset, especially with higher doses.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nAbdominal discomfort, diarrhea, essential fatty acid deficiency, intestinal gas noises, irritability, nausea, reflux, vomiting. Gastrointestinal disturbances are thought to be associated with higher doses of MCT. Since MCTs are fats, excessive consumption can result in weight gain.\nCardiovascular\nThere is some concern that MCTs may further increase the risk for hypertriglyceridemia in some preterm infants due to immature lipoprotein lipase activity in these infants. A case of extremely elevated triglyceride levels of 4,736 mg/dL and associated lipemia retinalis has been reported at 43 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) for a preterm infant born at 30 weeks' gestational age. It was discovered that the baby had been receiving MCT supplements in addition to breast milk starting at 42 weeks' PMA. MCT supplements were discontinued. One month later triglycerides were reduced to 287 mg/dL, and the retinal vasculature had a normal hue. However, at 2-month follow-up, triglyceride levels were elevated to levels higher than normal for age despite MCT discontinuation. Investigators speculated that a genetic disorder of lipid metabolism may also have contributed to the elevated triglyceride levels in addition to use of MCTs (96330).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, MCTs can cause significant gastrointestinal upset. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported side effect (11723, 93737, 93738, 101967). Other reported side effects include vomiting, irritability, nausea, reflux, abdominal discomfort, intestinal gas noises, and essential fatty acid deficiency (11723, 93738, 101967). Taking MCTs with food can reduce these adverse effects (93737). Gastrointestinal disturbances are thought to be associated with higher doses of MCT, such as 85 grams (93731).\nless\nOther\nExcessive consumption of MCTs can result in weight gain. MCT oil contains 6-8.5 calories per gram. One tablespoon provides about 14 grams and about 115 calories (11724).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCachexia. Intravenous MCTs can provide calories in critically ill patients and patients with refractory cachexia, but do not seem to offer any advantages over long chain triglycerides.\nSeveral small clinical studies in critically ill patients and patients with refractory cachexia secondary to cancer show that receiving parenteral nutrition with a 1:1 mixture of MCTs and long chain triglycerides is similarly effective to long chain triglycerides alone for improving metabolic parameters or nutritional status (2275, 2276, 93739).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral MCTs do not seem to promote weight gain or prevent weight loss in patients with HIV infection.\nA large clinical study in patients with HIV infection shows that taking a peptide-based supplement containing MCTs (Peptamen Oral Complete Elemental Diet, Nestlé Clinical Nutrition) with multivitamins and minerals is no more effective than taking multivitamins and minerals alone for promoting weight gain or preventing weight loss (11730).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral MCTs are beneficial in patients with age-related cognitive decline.\nA small, single-blind clinical study in older adults residing in a nursing home shows that taking MCTs 6 grams (a 3:1 mixture of caprylic acid:capric acid), with or without L-leucine 1.2 grams and vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 20 mcg, daily for up to 3 months increases mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores by an average of 3.5 points, compared with a 0.7-point decline in those receiving a long chain triglyceride control. MMSE scores returned to baseline 1.5 months after discontinuation of MCT supplementation (105710).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral MCTs do not improve cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment shows that taking MCTs (as combinations of caprylic acid and capric acid) in doses of 20-56 grams or 22.5-165 mL daily for up to 6 months does not improve cognition when compared with placebo or baseline (103012).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral MCTs are beneficial for endurance athletic performance.\nA very small clinical study in 10 male recreational endurance runners shows that taking a ketone supplement containing MCTs and a salt form of beta-hydroxybutyrate 60 minutes prior to a run does not improve 5-kilometer run time when compared with placebo (107738). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCeliac disease. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for celiac disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nChylothorax. It is unclear if oral MCTs improve time to resolution of spontaneous congenital chylothorax in neonates.\nA small retrospective study in neonates with spontaneous congenital chylothorax shows that administering MCTs does not improve the time to resolution of chylothorax when compared with total parenteral nutrition (11729).\nless\nChyluria. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for chyluria, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nCystic fibrosis. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for cystic fibrosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nEpilepsy. It is unclear if oral MCTs are beneficial in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nA small clinical study in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with drug-resistant epilepsy shows that adjunctive treatment with MCTs (Stepan Lipid Nutrition) as part of a non-ketogenic diet, 47-65 mL daily (about 35% of energy intake), or a maximally tolerated dose not exceeding 100 mL, for 12 weeks reduces median seizure frequency by 46% when compared with baseline (101967). The validity of this study is limited by its small sample size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nGallbladder disease. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for gallbladder disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nHypertriglyceridemia. Oral MCTs might improve triglyceride levels and body weight in some patients with overweight and hypertriglyceridemia, but its effect in other populations is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with overweight and hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking 25-30 grams of an oil containing MCTs 13% daily for 8 weeks decreases triglyceride levels by 78 mg/dL when compared with consuming oil containing only long chain fats. Body weight, body fat, and waist circumference also decreased (93740). However, this benefit may be restricted to this specific population only. Some research in patients with obesity or patients with a normal body weight shows that taking 25-30 grams of an oil containing MCTs daily for 8 weeks does not lower triglyceride levels (93741).\nless\nObesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral MCTs modestly improves weight loss; however, any effects may not be clinically relevant.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking MCTs decreases body weight by 0.5 kg, waist circumference by 1.5 cm, and hip circumference by 0.8 cm when compared with a control group not taking MCTs. Doses used in available research have ranged from 1-54 grams daily, or 1% to 24% of energy for 4-16 weeks (93735). Most research shows that at least 4 weeks is needed before effects are seen. The greatest benefit seems to occur in patients of Asian descent, males, and patients with higher body mass indices at baseline (93730, 93731, 93735, 93736). While MCTs may improve weight loss in some patients, the effects are generally modest and may not be clinically relevant.\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral or topical MCTs are beneficial in preterm infants.\nA meta-analysis of small studies involving 136 otherwise healthy preterm infants receiving full enteral diets with formula as the predominant source of nutrition shows that administration of formulas containing at least 30% of fat by weight as MCTs (ranging in concentration from 6% to 80%) for at least 7 days does not affect short-term growth, including weight, length, and head circumference, when compared with formulas containing less than 30% of fat by weight as MCTs. Due to small study sizes, it is unclear whether either type of formula was better tolerated. The validity of this analysis is limited by the presence of unclear risk of potential bias in the included studies (105711).\n\nMCT oil has also been evaluated for the prevention of gastrointestinal Candida infections. A very small clinical study in preterm infants shows that adding MCT oil (Nestlé Health Science) 0.5 mL per ounce of formula or breast milk for 1 week reduces Candida colonization when compared with no MCT oil (101968).\n\nTopical use of MCT oil has also been evaluated for growth in preterm infants. A small clinical study in preterm infants weighing 1500-2000 grams shows that massage with MCT oil, consisting of tactile and kinesthetic stimulation, three times daily for 7 days increases weight gain when compared with no massage (107739). The validity of this finding is limited by unclear reporting. Also, it is unclear if this effect is due to MCT oil, massage, or the combination.\nless\nPrimary intestinal lymphangiectasia. It is unclear if oral MCTs are beneficial for the management of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia.\nA review of 55 case reports suggests that taking MCTs as part of a low-fat, high-protein diet resolves symptoms in 63% of patients with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, compared with 36% of patients receiving no treatment or other treatments such as diuretic therapy, albumin transfusions, resection of isolated segments of affected bowels, etc. Mortality is also reduced by 79% in patients treated with diet restrictions and MCTs when compared with those receiving no treatment or other treatments (93733).\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral MCTs are beneficial in frail older adults.\nA small clinical study in older adults residing in a nursing home shows that taking MCTs 6 grams, leucine 1.2 grams, and vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 20 mcg daily for 3 months increases body weight by 1.1 kg, right-hand grip strength by 13%, and peak expiratory flow by 28% when compared with baseline. These improvements are also significant when compared with patients receiving no supplementation (93729). In a second study in this same population conducted by the same research group, taking MCTs 6 grams, with or without leucine 1.2 grams and vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 20 mcg, daily for 3 months does not increase body weight or hand grip strength. There were small to moderate improvements in opening and closing the legs, repetitive swallowing, and measures of functional independence (101970). The validity of these findings is limited by the single-blind nature of the studies and the large number of endpoints. It is also unclear if any benefits are due to MCTs, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral MCTs for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of MCTs for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate MCTs for these uses.\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with MCTs.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMCTs are efficiently absorbed. At physiological pH, MCTs are weak electrolytes and highly ionized, which increases their solubility (11724). Unlike long chain triglycerides (dietary fat), MCTs don't require the intestinal lymphatic system or bile salts for absorption. They are absorbed directly into the portal circulation (11723, 93731, 93736).\nMetabolism\nMCTs are metabolized primarily in the liver by beta-oxidation (11724, 93731, 93736).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMedium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are semi-synthetic lipids composed of three medium-chain (6-12 carbon atoms in length) saturated fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone (93730, 93731, 93734, 93736). MCTs are made from hydrolyzed coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The resulting fatty acids are fractionated and esterified to produce MCTs. These fatty acids include mostly lauric acid, but also caproic acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid (11724, 11725).\nAnti-chylothorax effects\nMCTs are absorbed by the portal system rather than by the intestinal lymph system. Therefore, MCTs have been tried for chylothorax, an effusion of a milky fluid (chyle) into the pleural space, due to trauma or a defect of the thoracic duct. Administering MCTs may decrease lymph flow in the thoracic duct and allow the thoracic duct defect to heal (11726, 11727, 11728, 11729).\nAnti-stress effects\nThere has been some interest in using MCTs for injured and stressed patients since it causes mild ketosis and may decrease skeletal muscle catabolism (11725). However, clinical trials have not shown any clear advantage of MCTs over long chain triglycerides (2275, 2276, 2278).\nAntidiabetic effects\nLaboratory and human research suggests that MCTs are less likely to induce insulin resistance than other longer chain fats (93731, 93734).\nCholesterol lowering effects\nAnimal research shows that MCTs increase cholesterol excretion, thereby reducing blood levels (93730). However, evidence from research in humans is not as consistent. In fact, some human research shows that MCTs may have negative effects on some blood lipids (93731, 107733). A small meta-analysis shows that MCT oil does not significantly affect total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, although it does increase triglyceride levels by 12 mg/dL when compared with control. However, a subgroup analysis demonstrates that the effect of MCT oil on total and LDL cholesterol differs by the fatty acid composition of the control. Total and LDL cholesterol are increased when compared with a control containing primarily unsaturated fatty acids, but little or no improvement in levels is observed when compared with a control containing longer chain saturated fatty acids (107733). Only the MCT lauric acid seems to offer benefit on cholesterol levels. Although lauric acid does not seem to reduce LDL cholesterol, it does appear to improve the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol by increasing HDL cholesterol levels (93734).\nCognitive effects\nThere is interest in using MCTs for cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. In patients with Alzheimer disease, some research suggests that there is decreased glucose metabolism in some parts of the brain. The brain primarily utilizes glucose as an energy source, but at times of fasting it can use ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone. Taking MCTs increases levels of ketone bodies and can lead to ketosis. Therefore, it is theorized that taking MCTs might improve energy metabolism in the brain and improve cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer disease. However, this has not been confirmed by clinical research (17028, 93734, 103012, 103013). Secondary analysis of a small clinical study in patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a ketogenic MCT supplement 30 grams daily for 6 months increases white matter energy supply through a nearly threefold uptake of ketones in white matter fascicles, without effects on glucose uptake, when compared with placebo. Several improved measures of processing speed are associated with such increases in ketone uptake, suggesting that ketones may play a role in myelin integrity (107735). Ketone bodies produced by consuming MCTs might also inhibit beta-amyloid damage in the brain (17029).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA small crossover study in adults of various weights shows that a single 25-gram dose of MCT oil delays all phases of gastric emptying (105709).\nInflammatory effects\nMCTs have been suggested to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. However, effects in humans are unclear. There is evidence from in vitro research that MCTs can induce inflammatory mediators in macrophages (93734). Secondary analysis of a small clinical study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a ketogenic MCT supplement 15 grams twice daily for 6 months increases levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 when compared with placebo (107734). However, it is unclear if these were acute or chronic increases. Also, some patients were taking anti-inflammatory drugs during the study, and baseline levels of IL-8 were at the low end of the usual range established in other studies.\nMetabolic effects\nA very small clinical study in healthy adults shows that MCT supplementation in combination with a ketogenic diet increases the formation of beta-hydroxybutyrate, but does not result in faster time to nutritional ketosis, when compared with a long chain triglyceride control in combination with a ketogenic diet (107737). A clinical study in 7 healthy adult females with no special nutrition habits shows that MCT supplementation in combination with caffeine influences ketogenesis, with increases in the formation of beta-hydroxybutyrate, when compared with MCT supplementation alone (107736).\nTriglyceride lowering effects\nIn healthy people, single doses of MCT oil can reduce blood triglyceride levels (834). Triglyceride levels are also reduced in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, especially in overweight individuals, using an oil containing medium- and long-chain fatty acids (93740, 93741). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, it is possible that the weight loss that accompanies the use of this oil results in benefits on blood fat levels (93731).\nWeight loss effects\nMedium chain fatty acids found in dietary MCTs are preferentially oxidized in the mitochondria, meaning that they are used first for energy production and are not stored as easily as long chain fatty acids (93729, 93731). Animal and human research suggests that MCTs might increase lipolysis and upregulate thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue (93730, 93731). Some preliminary evidence suggests that MCTs may increase metabolic rate and energy expenditures by the body when substituted in the diet for other types of fat (93731). MCTs may also induce satiety (93731, 93732, 93738). It has been suggested that increased satiety might decrease caloric intake, and in combination with increased metabolic rate, may lead to a slight decrease in body fat (10421, 11724, 93731, 93736, 101965, 105709).\n\nA small crossover study in adults with a body mass index (BMI) classified as normal to obese shows that a single 25-gram dose of liquid MCT oil modestly reduces caloric intake at the subsequent ad libitum lunch meal when compared with conjugated linoleic acid, but has no effect when compared with an equicaloric control. MCT oil also reduces caloric intake over the next 48 hours and delays all phases of gastric emptying. However, it does not affect levels of peptide YY or total ghrelin, which are involved in the regulation of appetite and satiety. These findings may have been confounded by high subjective nausea scores reported with MCT oil and the potential impact of nausea on caloric intake (105709). Also, the MCT formulation might be important, with one study showing a greater reduction in subsequent caloric intake with liquid MCTs when compared with solid MCTs (101965)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "The term \"melanotan\" describes two synthetic products known as melanotan-I and melanotan-II. These products were originally developed as analogues to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), an endogenous peptide hormone responsible for pigmentation of the skin. Melanotan-I, also known as afamelanotide, has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of erythropoietic porphyrias (95749). Melanotan-II is an unapproved new drug that can increase skin pigmentation and induce penile erections. Commercial products containing melanotan-I or melanotan-II are unlicensed and unregulated in the U.S. Despite advice by the FDA to avoid use, these products remain available on the internet, in some tanning salons and spas, and from cosmetic physicians (99175, 99176, 99177, 99178, 99180, 99183, 99185).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used subcutaneously. Although subcutaneous melanotan has been used with apparent safety in some preliminary clinical research, moderate to severe nausea is common (5685, 5687, 5688, 99190). Furthermore, there are at least three cases of rapidly-developing melanoma thought to be related to the use of melanotan in individuals also using tanning beds (99176, 99184, 99187). In addition, subcutaneous injection of melanotan has been associated with at least one case of systemic toxicity and rhabdomyolysis, and two cases of priapism requiring reversal surgery (99183, 106742, 106744).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of intranasal melanotan.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nSubcutaneously, melanotan can cause gastrointestinal cramping (5685), nausea (5685, 5687, 5688, 99176, 99190), decreased appetite (5687), facial flushing (5685, 5688), fatigue, somnolence (5685), dizziness, yawning, stretching, and spontaneous penile erections (5685, 5687, 5688, 99190, 106742). It can also cause increased pigmentation of the face, upper body, and buttocks (5685). In case reports of light-skinned individuals with sun-seeking behavior, melanotan has been associated with changes to existing nevi and the development of melanoma (99176, 99177, 99178, 99184, 99186, 99187, 99188, 99189).\n\nThere is a case of systemic toxicity after use of subcutaneous melanotan. Symptoms included overall body aches, sweating, anxiety, pupil dilation, tachycardia, muscle tremors, and rhabdomyolysis (99183). There is also a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) resulting in a single seizure for a patient who used melanotan subcutaneously daily for one week (99179).\nDermatologic\nSubcutaneously, melanotan can cause facial flushing (5685, 5688, 99190). It can also cause increased pigmentation of the face, upper body, and buttocks (5685). In case reports of individuals with light skin and a history of use of tanning beds, the eruption of new nevi, and darkening of existing nevi or change to dysplastic nevi, were thought to be related to the use of subcutaneous melanotan. In all cases, the changes occurred suddenly after 1-4 injections of melanotan. Whether the melanotan use, the tanning bed, or the combination played a role in these changes is not completely clear (99177, 99178, 99188, 99189). Pigmentary changes, resulting in an eruptive pigmented lesion, also occurred in a 63-year-old male with light skin and a history of multiple actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinomas who had used subcutaneous melanotan for 15 days. A history of tanning beds was not mentioned (99186). There is also a case report of a female who developed transverse pigmented streaks on the ﬁngernails after use of subcutaneous melanotan suggested by a physician for tanning (99185).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nSubcutaneously, melanotan can cause gastrointestinal cramping (5685), nausea (5685, 5687, 5688, 99176, 99190), and decreased appetite (5687). Severe nausea has occurred after up to 20% of injections, with vomiting rarely (99190).\nless\nGenitourinary\nSubcutaneously, melanotan-II can cause spontaneous penile erections and priapism (5685, 5687, 5688, 106742). In two case reports, males aged 41 and 55 using subcutaneous melanotan-II for tanning developed ischemic priapism lasting 22 hours and 30 hours, respectively. In one case the dose was unknown, and in the other it was 2 mg. Both patients had used melanotan-II previously without adverse effects, both required surgical management, and both subsequently developed erectile dysfunction (106742, 106744).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nMelanotan can cause fatigue and somnolence (5685), as well as yawning and stretching (5685, 5687, 5688, 99190).\n\nThere is a case report of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurring in a 20-year-old female who had a single seizure following use of subcutaneous melanotan daily for 1 week. The seizure resulted in reduced sensation on one side and reduced concentration and word-finding ability. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed almost complete resolution within 2 weeks. An effect of melanotan on blood pressure was thought to be responsible (99179). Melanotan may cause systemic toxicity and rhabdomyolysis due to overstimulation of certain sympathomimetic pathways. A case of sympathomimetic overdrive characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, tremulousness, and mydriasis has been reported for a 39-year-old patient who used subcutaneous melanotan 6 mg. The patient developed renal injury and rhabdomyolysis, which necessitated hospitalization in the intensive care unit for 3 days (99183).\nless\nOncologic\nSubcutaneously, melanotan has been associated with cases of melanoma, particularly in patients with fair skin and existing moles who also use tanning beds. In one case report, melanoma occurred in a 20-year-old female who had self-injected with melanotan at doses of 0.1 mL (1 mg) on alternate days for 3-4 weeks, while also using a tanning bed (99176). In another case, a 23-year-old female self-injected with two injections a week apart before noticing changes in an existing mole. The patient, who also used a tanning bed, had a total of 7 weekly injections before being diagnosed with melanoma (99184). A third female was diagnosed with melanoma after progressive darkening of a pigmentary nevus on the abdomen. In addition to the occasional use of tanning beds, the patient used melanotan 100 mg daily for 2 days, followed by 50 mg daily for 5 days (99187). Whether the melanotan use, the tanning bed, or the combination played a role in the development of melanoma in these patients is not completely clear (99176, 99184, 99187).\nless",

Preliminary clinical research shows that using melanotan-II subcutaneously is superior to placebo in males with psychogenic or organic erectile dysfunction for initiating spontaneous sustained penile erections. Melanotan-II resulted in erections in at least 63% of participants, maintaining peak rigidity without pain for up to 45 minutes. The typical dose used was 0.025 mg/kg. However, because of side effects, including severe nausea, melanotan-II is not recommended for this use (5685, 5687, 5688, 99190).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of melanotan for its other uses.\nless",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe melanotans, melanotan-I and melanotan-II, were originally developed as synthetic analogues to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (99175, 99176, 99177, 99178, 99183, 99185). Melanotan-I, a linear tridecapeptide, has two amino acid substitutions (norleucine for methionine at position 4 and racemization of D-phenylalanine at position 7) in the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone peptide sequence (5685, 5686, 99175). Melanotan-II is a cyclic heptapeptide containing a lactam bridge between the amino acids lysine and aspartic acid (5685, 5686, 99175, 99181). Melanotans available on the internet do not appear to be pure compounds, with reports that they contain 4% to 6% unknown impurities (99175).\nSexual effects\nMelanotan-II has non-specific effects at various melanocortin receptors (99175). This results in spontaneous penile erections and increased sexual motivation, including in males with erectile dysfunction (5685, 5687, 5688). There are distinct melanocortin receptors found primarily in the brain and nervous system, including melanocortin-3 and -4 receptors. Melanocortin-5 receptors might also play a role in effects on sexual motivation (5686, 99181, 99183, 99190). Animal data suggest melanotropic peptides act in the hypothalamic regions surrounding the third ventricle. Increased sexual motivation has been shown in both male and female animals (5687, 99190). The central mechanism is thought to involve a dopamine-oxytocin pathway (5687).\nSkin pigmentation effects\nMelanotan-I has melanotropic potency that is 26- to 1000-fold greater than alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, as well as increased resistance to degradation by plasma enzymes (5685, 5686, 99178). Melanotan-II has an even greater melanotropic potency than melanotan-I (5685, 5686, 99181). Melanotropic effects involve the melanocortin-1 receptor in melanocytes, resulting in the intracellular synthesis of eumelanin, leading to hyperpigmentation (99176, 106742)."

    "Melatonin": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Melatonin is an endogenous hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland (1773, 96314, 96318, 96320). Melatonin regulates the body's circadian rhythm, endocrine secretions, and sleep patterns (1773, 7043).",
            "Warnings": "Most commercial melatonin that is found in supplements is synthesized in the laboratory. However, in rare cases it can be derived from animal pineal gland. Melatonin from animal sources should be avoided due to the possibility of contamination (1772, 8266). Melatonin supplements have been shown to have high lot-to-lot variability in content, with some products containing almost five times above the amount indicated on the label. In addition, some melatonin supplements may be contaminated with serotonin (108144).\n\nBecause of its potential for causing daytime sleepiness, people should not drive or use machinery for 4-5 hours after taking melatonin (1772).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite some laboratory data suggesting benefit, there is no good evidence from clinical trials to support the use of melatonin for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term or as a single dose. Melatonin seems to be safe when used up to 8 mg daily for up to 6 months. Melatonin 10 mg daily has been used safely for up to 2 months (1049, 1068, 1077, 1085, 1738, 1754, 5854, 5855, 5857, 12226), (14283, 15005, 62850, 89502, 89503, 88285, 88289, 88293, 88294, 88295)(88296, 88299, 89508, 89510, 89511, 96313, 96314, 96316, 96317, 96319)(96321, 97438, 99345, 103484, 106301, 106303, 107811, 110286, 110299). ...when used topically and appropriately (1066, 1768, 1769, 4713, 4714, 96314).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when doses of up to 8 mg daily are used orally and appropriately for longer than 6 months, doses of 10 mg daily are used for longer than 2 months, or doses of 50 mg daily are used for up to 5 days (7040, 7043, 62435, 106296, 107811). There is some evidence melatonin can be used safely in doses of up to 10 mg daily for up to 2 years in some patients (7040, 7043, 62435). ...when used intravenously under the supervision of a healthcare professional. A one-time dose of intravenous melatonin combined with a single bolus of intracoronary melatonin has been used with apparent safety in one clinical trial (96324).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in low doses, short-term (9980, 15034, 62792, 88282, 88283, 88286, 88288, 95748, 96318, 97434)(97439, 97446, 106293, 110292, 113216, 113223, 113224). Although melatonin has been safely used in clinical research in doses up to 12 mg daily (88283), it is often advised that daily doses of melatonin be limited to 3 mg daily for children and infants 6 months or older and 5 mg daily for adolescents (95746). There is some concern that taking melatonin might adversely affect gonadal development in children (1739, 1740, 1742, 1743). While some evidence suggests that long-term use of melatonin in children may delay puberty, the available research includes only 3 small, observational studies with incomplete follow-up and poor measures of pubertal timing (95747). Although rare, pediatric overdose with melatonin has resulted in hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death (108145). Due to potential risks, the International Pediatric Sleep Association (IPSA) expert consensus recommendations for typically developing children state that only verified melatonin products should be used. Also, melatonin should be used in combination with behavioral approaches under medical supervision after a thorough sleep evaluation. IPSA states that melatonin should generally be avoided in children under 2 years, in children without sleep complaints, and in adolescents trying to accommodate early school schedules (116912).\nCHILDREN: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of melatonin when used long-term.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally or parenterally in high doses or with frequent use. High doses of melatonin 75-300 mg daily seem to inhibit ovulation, causing a contraceptive effect (769, 1740, 6002, 8271, 95728). Advise pregnant patients and patients wishing to become pregnant to avoid using melatonin frequently or in high doses.\nPREGNANCY: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of melatonin in lower doses during pregnancy. Some research shows that taking melatonin 2 mg daily does not affect anterior pituitary hormone levels in females who are not pregnant; this suggests that low doses may not have a contraceptive effect (62898). Other research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily during the follicle stimulating stage of in vitro fertilization does not negatively impact pregnancy rates (62818, 62819, 88297, 89512, 88297). However, it is not known if melatonin is safe for use throughout pregnancy (95729). Until more is known about the safety of melatonin, avoid using during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, melatonin is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that melatonin may increase the risk for seizure.\nCardiovascular\nMelatonin might increase levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (62176). Several rare or poorly described cases of abnormal heart rhythms, palpitations, fast heart rate, or chest pain have been reported. However, in these cases, the patients were taking other drugs that could account for the symptoms, and melatonin was not thought to be the cause (1079, 9181, 62776, 62789, 63067). Additionally, four cases of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure associated with melatonin intake have been reported (114510).\nless\nDermatologic\nPapular skin rash and pruritus has been reported with melatonin use. However, the effect was generally mild and did not require cessation of melatonin treatment (62450, 62754, 109696), and had similar rates as placebo (96316). Cutaneous flushing, angiokeratoma, and nasal mucosal ulcers have also been reported (62770, 62914, 114510). Two cases of fixed drug eruption on the genitalia have been reported for patients who used oral melatonin (Nature's Bounty Natural melatonin) for preventing jet lag (88284).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, melatonin use might be associated with higher rates of precocious puberty, growth hormone deficiency, elevated cortisol, and increased progesterone (114510). A case of gynecomastia (increased breast size) has been reported for a 56 year-old patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who used oral melatonin, long-term (89430). Also, reduced sperm concentration and sperm motility has been reported for two men who used oral melatonin 3 mg daily for 6 months. Improvement in sperm quality was observed for only one of the two men following melatonin cessation (62231).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, melatonin may cause nausea (62384, 62770, 114510), abdominal cramps, or mild abdominal pain (62450, 62754, 62914, 96316), diarrhea (62804, 62811, 62914), constipation (96316), or decreased appetite (62345, 62792). Often these symptoms occur during the first few days of treatment and subside after a few days (62804). In some cases, rates of symptoms are similar between melatonin and placebo (96316). Less often, melatonin has been reported to cause abnormal feces (62450), odd taste in the mouth (1070), pouchitis (114510), or reflux esophagitis (1745) when used orally. A case of exacerbated symptoms of Crohn disease, including increased diarrhea and abdominal cramps, has been reported for a patient who took oral melatonin 3 mg at bedtime for 4 days. Symptoms resolved within 24 hours of melatonin treatment cessation (62218).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, melatonin may increase enuresis in adults and children (58685, 62450, 62710, 62770, 62804, 62804, 62811). In perimenopausal adults, melatonin has caused a resumption of spotting or menstrual flow (11806). Decreased libido has been noted for one patient treated with melatonin 3 mg daily for 8 weeks (15216).\nless\nHematologic\nA case of nose bleed has been reported with oral melatonin (62450). Some melatonin preparations contain contaminants that are associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (9715, 9716).\nless\nHepatic\nA case of autoimmune hepatitis has been reported for a patient who took melatonin orally to treat insomnia (63037). Melatonin use has also been linked to a few cases of Gilbert's syndrome (114510).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, melatonin might increase fall risk. Analysis of a large adverse event database suggests that the rate of accidents and falls is higher with melatonin use when compared with the average rate of all other medications combined. However, the rate of accidents and falls with melatonin use seems to be lower when compared with other sleep medications (114510). Other clinical evidence shows that a single dose of melatonin 3 mg may increase fall risk due to increased postural swaying while standing on one or both feet in healthy adults ages 60-71 years (97442).\n\nA single case of ataxia has been reported for an 81-year-old female who used melatonin for 4 days (9181). Weakened muscle power has been reported for two patients treated with melatonin 5 mg in the evening (62456). Some melatonin preparations contain contaminants that are associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (9715, 9716). There are also reports of back pain, dropped head syndrome, fractures, growth retardation, and myalgia associated with melatonin intake (114510).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, melatonin may cause migraine-like headache (1070, 1077, 15034, 62384, 62450, 62710, 62754, 62804, 62792, 62914, 88288, 88293, 88294, 96318)(106297, 114510) or dizziness (62345, 62384, 62450, 62456, 62770, 62784, 62792, 62804, 62811, 89510)(110297). Often these symptoms occur during the first few days of treatment and subside after a few days (62804). Melatonin may also cause drowsiness or fatigue when taken orally (1077, 8273, 15216, 62384, 62456, 62784, 62804, 62811, 88288, 89510, 96314, 96316, 96318, 97446)(106293, 106297, 114510). These symptoms appear to be more common if melatonin is taken in the morning or at very high doses (greater than 50 mg) (8269, 62874). A case of excessive drowsiness has been reported when melatonin was combined with citalopram, nortriptyline, and oxycodone. Sedation improved with discontinuation of melatonin (96315). Indiscriminate use of melatonin may cause irregular sleep-wake cycles to occur (62998). Less commonly, melatonin may also cause behavior worsening (62811), confusion or disorientation (63014, 63067), nighttime awakening (62710, 62811), mood swings or agitation (96318), stereotypy (96318), tic (114510), excitement before bedtime (62811), insomnia (114510), nightmares or more intense dreams (62401, 62462, 62780, 62784, 88283, 114510), feelings of a \"rocking\" sensation (62155), or reduced alertness when taken orally.\n\nA case of generalized epilepsy has reportedly occurred after treatment with melatonin for 4 months (9708). Also, some case reports raise concerns about increased risk of seizure with melatonin treatment, but conflicting evidence suggests that melatonin may decrease the risk of seizures (1699, 8248, 9695, 9697, 9744, 9746, 62123, 62256, 62384, 62754)(63070, 63071, 89431). One patient experienced hyponatremia with confusion and seizures after taking prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg. However, malnutrition and cannabis abuse were also thought to contribute to this reaction (96321).\n\nAlthough there is concern that melatonin might affect cognitive function in healthy adults, research in humans suggests that oral or topical melatonin do not impact most measures of cognitive function (97442, 97448).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nThere are six case reports of pupillary disorder associated with melatonin intake (114510).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, melatonin may cause mood changes, including dysphoria (sadness) (1764), dips in mood (62345, 62450, 62792), nervousness (62784), suicide or self-injury (114510), or transient depression (1077). Delusions and hallucinations have also been reported in clinical research (62347). An analysis of adverse event case reports indicates that drug abuse, dependence, and withdrawal have been associated with melatonin use; however, the rate appears to be lower when compared with all other medications combined or sleep medications (114510).\n\nThis analysis also suggests that melatonin use might be associated with educational problems, social behavior disturbances, defiant behavior, oppositional defiant disorder, and school refusal at disproportionately higher rates when compared with all other drugs combined or other sleep medications (114510). An isolated incident of aggressiveness was also noted in a child diagnosed with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who took melatonin in combination with methylphenidate (9980). Severe irritability has been reported in two children with autism spectrum disorder who had abruptly discontinued melatonin due to the completion of a clinical trial (106293).\nless\nOther\nThere are case reports of body temperature fluctuation and post viral fatigue syndrome associated with melatonin intake (114510).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). Oral melatonin shortens the time needed to fall asleep in children and adults with DSPS.\nMost clinical research shows that taking melatonin orally reduces the length of time needed to fall asleep and advances sleep onset time in young adults and children with DSPS (8244, 12226, 15005, 62714, 62792, 63055, 88288, 88290, 89509). In adults, 0.3-5 mg daily for up to 9 months has been used (8244, 62714, 62792, 63055, 88290, 89509). In children, 1-6 mg before bedtime for up to one month has been used (62714, 62792, 89509). In addition to improving sleep, melatonin also improves measures of quality of life such as mental health, vitality, and bodily pain in young adults with DSPS (8244, 12226, 15005). However, relapse to pre-treatment sleeping patterns seems to occur within one year after stopping supplementation (63048).\nless\nNon-24-hour sleep wake disorder. Oral melatonin improves non-24-hour sleep wake disorder in blind children and adults.\nTaking oral melatonin 0.5-4 mg daily in children and 0.5-10 mg daily in adults for up to 6 years helps improve circadian rhythm sleep disorders in blind children and adults (1082, 1744, 1749, 6585, 62346, 62350).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBeta blocker-induced insomnia. Oral melatonin seems to improve sleep in patients with insomnia related to the use of beta-blockers.\nBeta-blockers such as atenolol and propranolol seem to decrease endogenous melatonin levels (1780). This might result in insomnia as a side effect. Clinical and preclinical research shows that taking a melatonin supplement might decrease the insomnia caused by beta-blockers (1062, 89502). Taking melatonin 5 mg at night after taking atenolol 100 mg appears to attenuate the changes in sleep onset latency, total wake time, and wakefulness after sleep onset when compared with taking atenolol 100 mg alone (1062). Also, in patients taking atenolol or metoprolol, taking melatonin 2.5 mg one hour before bedtime for 20-28 days increases total sleep time by 13-37 minutes and decreases sleep latency by 8-14 minutes when compared with placebo (89502).\nless\nCancer. In patients with various types of cancer, most research shows that oral or combined intramuscular/oral melatonin in combination with chemotherapy or other treatments seems to improve tumor regression and survival rates.\nThere is some evidence that taking combined high-dose melatonin with conventional chemotherapy or with interleukin-2 (IL-2) might improve tumor regression rate in patients with breast, lung, kidney, liver, pancreatic, stomach, or colon cancer (1692, 5854, 5855, 5857, 7040, 7043, 8268, 62407, 62844). Melatonin plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors seems to increase the regression rate and one-year survival rate by about 40% to 50% when compared with chemotherapy alone (7040, 62407, 62844, 89504). The addition of melatonin also seems to help reduce chemotherapy toxicities, including hematologic complications, cachexia, asthenia, and neuropathy (8268, 62844, 89504). There is also some preliminary evidence that melatonin alone, orally or intramuscularly, might improve stabilization rate and possibly one-year survival rate in patients with resistant or untreatable neoplasms of the lung, liver, pancreas, colon, breast, or brain (1080, 1688, 1693, 2566). Also, when used in combination with radiotherapy, high-dose melatonin seems to increase the survival time and percent survival in patients with brain glioblastomas when compared with radiotherapy alone (62991). However, high-dose melatonin treatment does not seem to improve the survival of patients with brain metastases who receive radiation therapy (62455). Melatonin 10-40 mg daily has been used in most clinical trials (1080, 1692, 1693, 2566, 5854, 5855, 5857, 7040, 7043, 8268)(62455, 62844, 62991, 89504). In one study, melatonin 20 mg intramuscularly daily for 2 months, followed by oral melatonin 10 mg daily as maintenance, was used (1688).\n\nThe effect of melatonin on quality of life and sleep quality in patients with cancer has also been investigated. A meta-analysis of six clinical trials shows that taking melatonin 20 mg daily does not improve sleep quality or quality of life when compared with a control, usually placebo. The duration of studies varied widely; from a period of 7 days or until death. However, there was a modest effect of melatonin on symptoms of depression in patients taking it for at least 14 days or those who underwent surgery (109697).\nless\nEmergence delirium. Oral melatonin seems to be beneficial for reducing sevoflurane-induced agitation in children. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for adults undergoing surgery.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research in adults undergoing various types of surgery with anesthesia show that taking perioperative melatonin 3-6 mg or the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon 8 mg orally daily for 1 day to 12 weeks reduces the risk of emergence delirium by 43% to 59% when compared with placebo or no treatment (112053, 114514). Subgroup analysis of one meta-analysis suggests that higher melatonin of 5 mg or greater decreases the incidence of emergence delirium, while lower melatonin doses of 3 mg and ramelteon do not impact emergence delirium incidence when compared with control. Additionally, melatonin intake is most beneficial for reducing emergence delirium in the early postoperative period within 3 days of surgery and for cardiopulmonary surgeries. No benefit was observed for hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, mortality, late postoperative periods of 7 days up to 12 weeks, or other surgery types when compared with control (114514). However, the validity of the results of both meta-analyses is limited by high heterogeneity. Another small clinical study conducted in Egypt in older patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer shows that taking melatonin 5 mg the night before surgery, 5 mg twelve hours before surgery, and 5 mg two hours before surgery reduces the incidence of delirium and decreases nurse-reported delirium scores six hours postoperatively, but at no other timepoints up to three days postoperatively, when compared with placebo (114508).\n\nIn children, clinical research shows that taking melatonin reduces the incidence of sevoflurane-associated emergence delirium (97440, 106292, 113216). Meta-analyses of 3-4 small clinical studies in children aged 2-9 years show that taking melatonin 0.05-0.5 mg/kg 40-45 minutes prior to sevoflurane reduces the incidence of agitation by 60% when compared with placebo (97440, 113216). The most recent analysis also shows that taking melatonin reduces the incidence of agitation by 52% when compared with midazolam (113216). Most research shows that doses of melatonin 0.2 mg/kg or greater may be most effective (97440, 106292). However, clinical research shows that taking melatonin is less effective than dexmedetomidine (109701, 113216). One study shows that taking melatonin 0.5 mg/kg before surgery is 55% less effective than intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 mg/kg for reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-associated emergence delirium (109701).\nless\nHypertension. Oral controlled-release melatonin seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount in patients with hypertension. Immediate-release melatonin may not have the same effect.\nControlled-release melatonin 2-24 mg, taken before bedtime for up to 4 weeks, seems to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 4-6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by about 4 mmHg in individuals with essential hypertension or high blood pressure at nighttime (62359, 62416, 62441, 62826, 108947). Some evidence shows that immediate-release melatonin does not have this effect (62826).\n\nSome evidence also suggests that melatonin seems to slightly reduce blood pressure in patients without hypertension, but to a lesser degree (103689). However, a very small clinical study in healthy young adults consuming a high sodium diet (6900 mg daily) shows that taking melatonin 10 mg before bedtime for 10 days decreases nighttime SBP but does not improve nighttime DBP, daytime SBP or DBP, 24-hour SBP or DBP, or nocturnal dipping of SBP or DBP when compared with placebo (112442).\nless\nInsomnia. In patients with insomnia, oral melatonin seems to shorten the time it takes to fall asleep by about 7-12 minutes, although the effect on the amount of time asleep is inconclusive. Melatonin is more likely to be beneficial in older adults or people with certain comorbidities.\nShort-term melatonin treatment appears to modestly reduce the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency) in otherwise healthy adults with insomnia. This reduction in sleep latency appears to amount to only about 7-12 minutes and might not be considered clinically relevant. Melatonin does not appear to improve sleep efficiency and may only increase total sleep time by about 8 minutes (15005, 88290). Despite lack of substantial improvements in objective measures, some patients report minor improvement in subjective feelings of sleep quality (1070, 1083, 12226, 88290). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults and those with sleep disorders shows that melatonin reduces sleep latency by 9 minutes and increases total sleep time by about 20 minutes when compared with placebo. Dose-response analysis indicates that melatonin doses of 3 to 5 mg daily optimally reduce sleep latency and increase total sleep time, and that higher doses provide no additional benefit. Furthermore, melatonin is most effective at reducing sleep onset latency when administered 2 to 3 hours prior to desired bedtime and in patients who are healthy rather than those with insomnia (114507).\n\nWhile clinical research remains limited, available studies in children aged 6-12 years with insomnia due to delayed onset of sleep shows that melatonin 5 mg or 0.05-0.15 mg/kg at bedtime for up to 4 weeks seems to shorten the time that it takes to fall asleep and increases the duration of sleep (9708, 62345, 62770). More evidence is needed on the long-term effects of melatonin for insomnia. The International Pediatric Sleep Association (IPSA) recently published expert consensus recommendations for typically developing children stating melatonin should only be used under medical supervision after a thorough sleep evaluation. Behavioral approaches should precede and accompany melatonin use. Additionally, except in rare cases, melatonin should be avoided in children under 2 years, in children without sleep complaints, and in adolescents trying to accommodate early school schedules. If starting melatonin, treatment should begin with the lowest dose 30-60 minutes before bedtime, and be limited to short-term use (116912).\n\nSome evidence shows that taking oral melatonin might be most beneficial for insomnia in elderly patients who could be melatonin deficient (1072, 1729, 1738, 1754, 7081, 15005, 62357, 62465, 62472, 62613)(62776, 62789). Taking sustained-release melatonin preparations 2 mg daily seems to improve sleep maintenance and sleep quality in elderly individuals (1738, 1754, 62465, 62472, 62613, 62776), while immediate-release preparations seem to decrease sleep latency (1738, 63041). In these clinical trials, controlled-release, fast-release, or slow-release melatonin 2-3 mg before bedtime for up to 29 weeks has been used (1072, 1738, 1754, 7081, 62357, 62465, 62472, 62613, 62776, 62789). However, using a melatonin patch placed on the gums does not improve sleep parameters in elderly patients with insomnia (63062).\n\nSome research shows that taking melatonin when taken either alone or in combination with other sleep aids such as bright-light treatment seems to be beneficial for insomnia in patients with certain comorbid conditions. Taking melatonin 2-12 mg for up to 4 weeks has been used to improve insomnia in patients with depression (1053, 1729), schizophrenia (8245, 62452), bipolar disorder (62140), asthma (62375), cystic fibrosis (62708), hospitalization (9709, 106295), and insomnia termed \"ICU syndrome\", which refers to sleep disturbances while in the intensive care unit (8240). Insomnia is also improved in children with epilepsy aged 3-12 years taking 6-9 mg of melatonin before bedtime for 4 weeks and children aged 3 months to 2 years taking 3 mg of melatonin before bedtime for 2 weeks (62394, 99342, 113223), and quality of sleep is modestly improved in adults with epilepsy taking 3 mg before bedtime for 8 weeks (110299). There is also evidence that melatonin can improve total sleep time and sleep-onset latency in children with tuberous sclerosis (1747), autism spectrum disorders (1056, 62811, 88286, 96318, 106293, 110290), developmental disabilities (9707), and neurodevelopmental disorders (21819, 62143, 88283). It also appears to decrease sleep latency and increase sleep time in adults and children with intellectual disabilities, with or without epilepsy (62373, 62561). While some evidence shows that fast-release melatonin is more effective for improving the time to fall asleep in children with sleep-wake cycle disturbances and neurodevelopmental disabilities, it is unclear if controlled-release melatonin provides any additional benefits in this population (62143, 95746).\n\nHowever, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of melatonin in patients with insomnia and comorbid conditions such as Alzheimer disease or dementia. Some clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3-5 mg before bedtime for up to 10 weeks, either alone or in combination with bright-light treatment, improves impaired sleep related to Alzheimer disease or dementia (1729, 62474, 63059). But not all research agrees. Meta-analyses of several clinical studies show that taking melatonin 3-10 mg daily improves subjective sleep quality, but not objective outcomes such as number of awakenings at night and sleep efficiency in these patients. Also, immediate-release melatonin 2.5-10 mg or prolonged-release melatonin 1.5-2.5 mg for 10 days to 24 weeks shows inconsistent effects on total sleep time at night in patients with Alzheimer disease (96319, 96320).\n\nThere is also mixed evidence regarding the effects of melatonin in patients with Parkinson disease. In some individual studies, subjective outcomes such as sleep quality seem to improve. However, improvement may not be clinically significant and might be dependent on dose and formulation. Also, objective outcomes such as sleep efficiency and total sleep time at night do not seem to improve (62403, 62454, 62829, 96320, 116924).\n\nMelatonin has also been evaluated in postoperative patients and patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Taking melatonin before bed does not improve sleep quality soon after tracheostomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or total knee arthroplasty (62439, 62552, 99343, 100255) or 2-6 weeks after total joint arthroplasty (106305). In adults with TBI, one clinical study shows that taking prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin, Sigma Pharmaceuticals) 2 mg two hours prior to bedtime for 4 weeks improves sleep quality, efficiency, and fatigue when compared with placebo. However, melatonin did not improve sleep onset latency or daytime sleepiness. There appears to be no association between TBI severity and the effect of treatment (96317).\n\nThere is mixed evidence regarding the effect of melatonin in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Some evidence shows that taking melatonin (Pharma Nord) 3 mg before bed for 6 weeks reduces time needed to fall asleep, improves sleep efficiency, and increases actual sleep time when compared with placebo (62521). Other clinical research in patients undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking immediate-release melatonin 3 mg (Puritans Pride, USA) for 3 months modestly improves various sleep measures when compared with placebo. After treatment, 63.0% of those taking melatonin had no insomnia compared with 7.7% of those taking placebo (110291). However, other evidence shows that taking immediate-release melatonin (Pharma Nord) 3 mg nightly for 12 months does not improve quality of life or sleep efficiency in these patients, indicating that melatonin may not improve sleep long-term (89501).\n\nFinally, limited evidence shows that melatonin does not improve insomnia in patients with substance use disorders (97441).\n\nMelatonin has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small clinical study in middle-aged adults with poor sleep quality shows that taking melatonin 1.9 mg and magnesium citrate 200 mg at bedtime for 4 weeks improves subjective sleep quality and objective sleep measures including latency by 17 minutes, efficiency, number of awakenings, and awakening length when compared with placebo. However, the combination of melatonin and magnesium does not improve other subjective measures of mood or daytime sleepiness and reduces total sleep time by 42 minutes when compared with placebo (116160). It is unclear whether these effects are due to melatonin, magnesium, or the combination.\nless\nJet lag. Taking oral melatonin 2-3 mg daily while travelling seems to improve alertness and reduce daytime sleepiness in people with jet lag. It is unclear if it improves sleep efficiency in this population. Higher doses might have a hypnotic effect.\nMost research shows that melatonin can modestly improve certain symptoms of jet lag such as alertness and psychomotor performance. Melatonin also seems to improve, to a lesser extent, other jet lag symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and fatigue (12226). Melatonin might not be effective for decreasing the time to fall asleep (sleep latency) or sleep efficiency in patients with jet lag (6496, 14283), although some research shows a beneficial effect of melatonin on these outcomes (62364).\n\nDoses between 0.5-5 mg appear to be equally effective. Although doses of up to 8 mg have been used, doses greater than 5 mg do not seem to be more effective and seem to produce a greater hypnotic effect. Travelers traveling eastward through five or more time zones may find 2-3 mg of melatonin, either slow-release or fast-release, to be useful when taken at local bedtime on the day of arrival and for 2-5 nights thereafter. Taking melatonin in advance of travel does not help prevent jet lag. The usefulness of melatonin for westward travel or over fewer time zones is less clear, although some evidence suggests that slow-release formulations are less effective than fast-release preparations (1049, 1077, 1079, 1085, 1722, 8273, 9181, 9750, 62706).\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral melatonin 3-4 mg seems to prevent migraines when used prophylactically. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for treating migraine.\nMelatonin production might be altered in people with migraine headache (6712, 96316). Meta-analyses and individual clinical studies in adults have shown that taking melatonin modestly reduces migraine severity, migraine duration, migraine frequency, migraine-related disability, and the need for analgesics and increases the likelihood of a 50% reduction in the baseline frequency of migraine, when compared with placebo or baseline. Immediate- or prolonged-release melatonin (occasionally as Circadin, Sigma Pharmaceuticals) in doses of 3-4 mg each evening for up to 6 months have been used in these studies (12149, 96316, 97438, 103486, 110286, 114512). Meta-analyses have included two or three individual clinical trials (103486, 110286). One meta-analysis shows that taking melatonin reduces the frequency of migraine days by about 1.7 (103486). An additional meta-analysis in adults with migraines shows that taking melatonin modestly reduces the use of analgesic medications from baseline, when compared with placebo (110286). In contrast, other clinical research shows that taking extended-release melatonin (Circadin, Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) 2 mg nightly for 8 weeks does not reduce migraine attack frequency when compared with placebo (62784).\n\nSome clinical research also shows that melatonin is as effective as standard treatment for migraine prevention. Some research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 12 weeks is as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and duration, as well as reducing analgesic use (96316). A meta-analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking melatonin 3 mg each evening for 8-12 weeks is as effective as standard treatment; however, only one study each compared melatonin with amitriptyline (96316) and valproate (110286). More research comparing melatonin with standard treatments is needed.\n\nMelatonin has also been investigated in children. Preliminary clinical research in children 5-15 years of age with migraine headache shows that taking melatonin 0.3 mg/kg daily for 90 days reduces migraine frequency, severity, and duration, and decreases analgesic use when compared to baseline (97446).\n\nSome research also suggests that melatonin might help to TREAT migraine headache in children and adolescents aged 9-17 years. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 1-8 mg reduces pain by a small amount 2-4 hours later. The higher doses of 2 mg for children weighing less than 40 kg and 8 mg for children weighing at least 40 kg seemed to have the greatest benefit (103487). This study is limited by the lack of a comparator group and a very high drop-out rate.\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. Most research shows that oral or sublingual melatonin reduces preoperative anxiety in adults. The benefit in children is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies in adults shows that taking oral or sublingual melatonin 3-10 mg or 0.05-0.4 mg/kg 20-120 minutes prior to surgery reduces preoperative anxiety by an average of 12 points on a 100-point visual analogue scale when compared with placebo. It also reduces postoperative anxiety by about 5 points when compared with placebo. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials suggests that melatonin is comparable to benzodiazepines such as midazolam, oxazepam, or alprazolam for reducing preoperative anxiety (105005). In some cases, melatonin might also be preferable to benzodiazepines because it does not cause anterograde amnesia, respiratory depression, or impairment of cognitive and psychomotor skills (88299, 99337).\n\nHowever, research in children is conflicting. Two small clinical studies in children aged 2-10 years preparing to undergo outpatient elective surgery show that taking melatonin 0.05-0.5 mg/kg 30-45 minutes before anesthesia is less effective than midazolam 0.5 mg/kg for reducing preoperative anxiety, including during separation from parents and when putting on the anesthesia mask (62601). In contrast, another small clinical study in children aged 2-5 years undergoing minor elective surgery shows that taking oral melatonin 0.25-0.5 mg/kg 1 hour before anesthesia is similar to midazolam 0.25-0.5 mg/kg for reducing anxiety when separating from parents and when putting on the anesthesia mask (62399). A third study in children aged 3-8 years found no differences between melatonin 0.3 mg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, and placebo for reducing preoperative anxiety (106292).\nless\nPre-procedural sedation. Oral melatonin might reduce the sedative dose required to achieve adequate sedation in children. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this purpose in adults.\nA clinical study in children aged 5-14 years undergoing surgery shows that oral melatonin 0.5 mg/kg reduces the propofol dose required for adequate sedation by 0.77 mg/kg when compared with midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (97444). However, taking melatonin 0.5 mg/kg 45 minutes before surgery is less effective than intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 mg/kg for successful mask acceptance and parental separation (109701). A meta-analysis of clinical and observational studies in children undergoing non-operative procedures, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggests that enteral or parenteral melatonin is no better for adequate sedation than sleep deprivation or chloral hydrate (105884). This finding is limited by imprecision, inconsistency, and a high risk of bias.\n\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy shows that taking extended-release melatonin 5 mg, 90 minutes before surgery, decreases the use of midazolam for sedation during surgery when compared with placebo (108945). However, the validity of this finding is unclear, as 0% of patients in the melatonin group required midazolam, compared with 100% of patients in the placebo group. In adults undergoing lower extremity orthopedic surgery with spinal anesthesia, a small study shows that giving melatonin 10 mg orally the night before surgery, followed by 10 mg 2 hours prior to surgery, increases the sedation score when compared with placebo (108951).\nless\nSunburn. Most research shows that topical melatonin seems to protect against erythema from ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.\nWhen applied prior to UV light exposure, a gel containing melatonin 0.05% to 2.5% seems to significantly decrease erythema (1066, 1768, 1769). In one study, topically applied melatonin in combination with vitamin E 2% and/or vitamin C 5%, was modestly photoprotective when used prior to UV exposure, but had no effect when used during or after UV exposure (4713, 4714). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream containing melatonin 12.5% prior to sun exposure reduces erythema in adults with high sun reactivity, but not in those with mild to moderate sun reactivity. Creams containing melatonin 0.5% or 2.5% did not reduce erythema in any skin types when compared with placebo (97443). The differences in these findings may be related to the different topical formulations used.\nless\nThrombocytopenia. Oral melatonin seems to improve and prevent thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, cancer treatment, and other disorders.\nClinical research shows that taking melatonin can improve thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, cancer treatment, and other disorders. Melatonin 20-40 mg daily beginning up to 7 days before chemotherapy and continuing for up to four chemotherapy cycles or until disease progression has been used (1694, 1695, 1696, 1697, 2564, 8268).\nless\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMD). Oral melatonin seems to moderately reduce pain in females with TMD.\nClinical research shows that taking melatonin 5 mg at bedtime for 4 weeks reduces pain by 44% and increases the ability to withstand pain by 39% when compared with placebo in females with TMD. This results in reduced analgesic use and improved sleep quality (89508).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Most research suggests that oral melatonin does not improve athletic performance or physical strength.\nTaking melatonin 6 mg one hour prior to heavy resistance exercise does not seem to improve maximal strength or maximal jumping ability (62424). Also, taking melatonin 5 mg at night does not appear to improve exercise performance the following morning in healthy athletes (62179). Furthermore, taking melatonin 5 mg 15 minutes prior to exercise does not appear to impact endurance during a cycling trial when compared with placebo (99338). However, some research disagrees. One small clinical trial in professional soccer players shows that taking melatonin 5 mg daily during a six-day training schedule modestly attenuates deterioration in physical performance, such as jumping, agility, and sprints, when compared with placebo (109700).\nless\nCachexia. Oral melatonin does not seem to improve appetite or body composition in patients with cachexia and cancer.\nClinical research in cachectic patients with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancers shows that taking melatonin 20 mg each evening for 28 days does not improve appetite, body weight, or body composition when compared with placebo (88287).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. Oral melatonin does not seem to improve fatigue in patients with cancer.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials shows that taking melatonin does not reduce fatigue in patients with cancer (109697). Most studies used melatonin 20 mg daily, with a duration of 7 days to one year (99344, 109697). Although most studies included in the analysis were small, one contained over 700 patients and lasted one year. However, some research disagrees. Preliminary clinical research in adults with breast cancer shows that taking melatonin 18 mg orally daily for 2 years moderately improves fatigue scores when compared with placebo (112054).\nless\nCancer-related pain. Oral melatonin does not seem to improve pain in patients with cancer.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials shows that taking melatonin does not reduce pain in patients with cancer (109697). Most studies used melatonin 20 mg daily, with a duration of 10 days to one year (109697). Although most studies included in the analysis were small, one contained over 700 patients and lasted one year.\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Oral melatonin does not seem to be beneficial for reducing hospital stay in critically ill patients.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in critically ill patients shows that taking melatonin does not reduce the length of stay in the ICU or the hospital, or affect mortality or sleep quality, when compared with placebo (109696). One additional small clinical study shows that receiving melatonin 3 mg through a nasogastric tube once at 9 pm, followed by a 0.5 mg hourly maintenance dose for 6 hours during the overnight period, does not improve sleep when compared with placebo in patients in the ICU that are being weaned off sedatives and mechanical ventilation (104997). Another moderate-sized clinical study in critically ill adults admitted to the ICU shows that administering enteral melatonin 3 mg once daily at night for 7 days does not improve consciousness levels or reduce delirium risk, mortality risk, length of ICU stay, or length of mechanical ventilation when compared with standard care (113496).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral melatonin improves behavior or cognition in patients with dementia. However, it might reduce evening confusion (sundowning).\nMost clinical research shows that taking melatonin does not improve cognition or behavioral or affective symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia (62421, 62530, 96319). However, a network meta-analysis in patients with mild Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment suggests that melatonin improves cognitive function more effectively than aducanumab, donanemab, lecanemab, and placebo (114515). This analysis included only two clinical trials comparing melatonin to placebo and is limited by significant heterogeneity, including differences in study durations. Other clinical research shows that taking melatonin 2.5-3 mg before bedtime for up to 10 weeks reduces sundowning, which is the confusion and restlessness experienced by some dementia patients in the evening (62788).\nless\nInfertility. Oral melatonin does not seem to increase fertility in females undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nSome clinical research shows that taking melatonin does not improve fertility rate or clinical pregnancy rate in adults undergoing IVF, although oocyte and embryo quality might be improved (62775, 62818, 62819, 88297, 89512). Also, results from meta-analyses of clinical research show that melatonin does not improve clinical pregnancy rate, total number of oocytes retrieved, or the rate of miscarriage, although it seems to increase the number of mature oocytes (89505, 106304). Most studies have used single doses of 3 mg daily which may not be adequate (106304).\n\nMelatonin has also been evaluated in adults undergoing ICSI. Although one study shows that taking melatonin improves the fertilization rate, the clinical pregnancy rate was not evaluated (88297). Other research in females taking melatonin and undergoing ICSI does not show an increase in clinical pregnancy rate (97445).\nless\nShift work disorder. Oral melatonin does not seem to improve sleep in individuals doing shift work.\nTaking melatonin orally doesn't seem to significantly improve the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), sleep efficiency, or adjustment to rotating shift work. However, slight increases in total sleep time during the day or overall sleep quality may occur (1052, 1054, 1721, 14283, 62200, 62401, 62462, 62942).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nBenzodiazepine withdrawal. Oral melatonin does not facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in patients with insomnia.\nAlthough some small studies show benefit (349, 1751), results from larger clinical studies and a meta-analysis of clinical research show that taking melatonin 2-5 mg before bedtime for up to 6 weeks does not help facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in patients with insomnia (62464, 62467, 63075, 88295, 96321, 96323).\nless\nDepression. Most research shows that oral melatonin does not reduce symptoms of depression or prevent depression. In some patients, taking melatonin might make symptoms worse.\nMost research shows that taking melatonin 5-10 mg daily before bedtime for 4-12 weeks, alone or with fluoxetine, does not improve depression symptoms in patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (1766) or major depressive disorder (MDD) (1053, 62746, 96326). However, some research shows that taking slow-release melatonin 3 mg in combination with immediate-release buspirone 15 mg daily for 6 weeks is more effective at improving depression severity and depression symptoms than placebo or buspirone alone in patients with MDD (88289). However, buspirone is not commonly used for the management of depression. Also, there is some concern that oral melatonin may worsen symptoms in some patients with unipolar or bipolar depression (1764).\n\nEvidence regarding the effects of melatonin for preventing depression is unclear. One clinical study shows that taking melatonin 6 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces the percentage of breast cancer patients who develop depression following a lumpectomy or mastectomy by about 75% when compared with placebo when an intention to treat analysis is used. However, when only patients who took all of the doses are considered, melatonin does not appear to have an effect (89511). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research including two studies in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who were at risk for depression shows that melatonin does not prevent depression when compared with placebo (96326).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute kidney injury (AKI). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for acute kidney injury.\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with drug-induced acute kidney injury shows that taking melatonin 3-30 mg daily for up to 6 days modestly improves glomerular filtration rate, but not serum creatinine or incidence of acute kidney injury, when compared with placebo (111463). Another meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials shows that taking melatonin inhibits the occurrence of acute kidney injury in at risk patients by 44% when compared with placebo. However, changes in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen were not statistically significant. Doses of melatonin varied from single doses of up to 5 mg and 6 mg to 30 mg daily for 5 to 14 days (113225).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral melatonin prevents vision loss in patients with AMD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 3-6 months may delay the loss of clear vision in individuals with AMD when compared with baseline (62419). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral melatonin might improve some symptoms of atopic dermatitis. However, it is unclear if it improves sleep in this population.\nPreliminary clinical research in children ages 1-18 years with atopic dermatitis and sleep disturbance shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces the overall atopic dermatitis symptom score by 19% when compared with placebo (97439). In another clinical study in children with atopic dermatitis, taking melatonin 6 mg daily 1 hour before bedtime for 6 weeks seems to improve disease severity and sleep quality when compared with placebo (99347). It is unclear whether melatonin improves sleep latency in this population, as conflicting results exist (97439, 99347).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for ADHD.\nSome small clinical studies in children with ADHD who are taking stimulants show that melatonin 3-5 mg daily for up to 3 months might reduce insomnia when compared with placebo (9980, 15034). However, improved sleep related to melatonin treatment does not seem to result in fewer symptoms of ADHD (15034).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nOne clinical trial in children aged 6-15 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking melatonin (Nobelpharma Co., Ltd) 1 mg or 4 mg before bedtime does not affect behavior when compared with placebo. However, this study was designed to evaluate sleep outcomes, not behavior, as a primary endpoint (106293). Also, a secondary analysis of results from a clinical trial in children with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking prolonged-release melatonin mini-tablets (PedPRM) 2-5 mg nightly for 13 weeks improves externalizing behavior in 26% more patients when compared with those taking placebo. There was no difference between groups in behaviors such as hyperactivity, inattention, emotional behavior, and relationships with peers (101256). The validity of these findings is limited by the secondary nature of the analysis, which was not designed to evaluate these outcomes.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for BPH.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking controlled-release melatonin 2 mg nightly for 4 weeks reduces excessive urination at night in some men with BPH when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear if this improvement is clinically significant (62360).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial in patients with beta-thalassemia.\nA small clinical study in adults with thalassemia and iron overload shows that taking melatonin (Natrol Melatonin Advance, Natrol LLC) 20 mg daily for 12 months modestly improves lumbar spine bone mineral density and reduces self-reported bone and back pain when compared to baseline but not when compared with placebo. Additionally, there was no effect on iron levels or control (116925). Although the majority of patients in this study had beta-thalassemia, about 7% had other types of thalassemia. Furthermore, this study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg at bedtime for 30 days increases sleep duration and reduces mania severity when compared to baseline in patients with bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant insomnia (62140). However, other research shows that melatonin is not beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder when compared with placebo. Taking melatonin 3-10 mg daily before bedtime for 3-12 weeks does not seem to improve mania or other symptoms when compared with placebo (1766, 103694). Also, taking a specific brand of slow-release melatonin (Cronocaps, Productos Medix) 5 mg each evening for 8 weeks may attenuate the increase in blood pressure and fat mass that is associated with use of second-generation antipsychotics, but it does not appear to improve mania or depression in patients with bipolar disorder (88300). There is also some concern that oral melatonin may worsen symptoms in some patients with bipolar depression (1764).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is unclear if oral melatonin reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants.\nA small clinical study in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who received surfactant shows that giving melatonin 3 mg daily for 7 days reduces the incidence of BPD to 45%, compared with 60% in those not receiving melatonin. Melatonin also reduced the duration of hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality (108948).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for patients with CFS.\nMany patients with CFS have circadian rhythm disturbances. Some very small clinical studies have evaluated the use of melatonin for addressing these disturbances. One study shows that taking melatonin 5 mg in the evening for 12 weeks might improve some measures of fatigue, concentration, motivation, and activity when compared with baseline (14437). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking the same dose of melatonin does not improve CFS symptoms when compared with placebo (9705).\n\nMelatonin has also been studied in combination with zinc. In patients with CFS, taking melatonin 1 mg plus zinc 10 mg before bedtime for 16 weeks modestly reduces self-reported levels of physical fatigue, but not self-reported cognitive or psychological symptoms, mood, sleep quality, or quality of life (QOL) measures, when compared with placebo. However, some measures of sleep quality and QOL worsened within 4 weeks of melatonin discontinuation, suggesting that there may have been a modest benefit (106241). It is unclear whether any benefit is related to melatonin, zinc, or the combination. Also, all patients in this study were White females, limiting the generalizability of the results.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for COPD.\nSome clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 3 months improves shortness of breath in patients with COPD when compared with placebo, although melatonin does not seem to improve lung function or exercise capacity (62854). Another small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily in combination with rehabilitative exercise training improves exercise capacity, health status, and quality of life when compared with placebo. The distance walked in 6 minutes was increased by 46 meters (113221).\nless\nCluster headache. It is unclear if oral melatonin prevents cluster headaches.\nA very small clinical study in adults with cluster headaches shows that taking melatonin orally 10 mg every evening for 14 days might reduce the frequency of episodic cluster headaches when compared with placebo (1127). However, 2 mg at bedtime does not seem to be effective (9702).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral melatonin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults 70 years and older with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking two capsules containing melatonin 5 mg, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 720 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 286 mg, vitamin E 16 mg, soy phospholipids 160 mg, and L-tryptophan 95 mg (IBSA Farmaceutici) before bedtime for 12 weeks modestly improves cognitive function and sensitivity to smells when compared with placebo. The observed improvement on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale falls below the score generally considered to be indicative of true changes in cognitive function, and may not be clinically significant. Also, it is not known if any potential benefit is due to melatonin, other ingredients, or the combination (62847).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that any history of melatonin use is associated with an approximate 20% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer, especially rectal cancer, in individuals aged 60 years and older (106291).\nless\nContraception. Although there has been interest in using oral melatonin for contraception, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of melatonin for this use.\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for recovery from CABG surgery.\nClinical research shows that taking melatonin perioperatively during CABG surgery reduces the length of stay in the ICU by about 0.5 days and modestly reduces levels of creatine kinase-MB when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the length of hospital stay or levels of cardiac troponin-I, C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Oral melatonin 3 mg was provided the night before and morning of surgery, as well as at bedtime for 3 days after surgery (109699).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral melatonin may reduce disease severity in patients with COVID-19, although some conflicting findings exist.\nA meta-analysis of mainly small and preliminary randomized clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 shows that taking melatonin improves clinical outcomes when compared with placebo. However, the clinical outcomes differed between individual trials, and included specific symptoms, hospital discharge, removal from quarantine, and survival. Dosing also varied, with doses of 2-24 mg daily in 1-4 divided doses for 6-14 days. There was no effect of melatonin on C-reactive protein levels or oxygen saturation (109695).\n\nIndividual clinical trials have been conducted in hospitalized and/or non-hospitalized patients with mild to severe COVID-19. One clinical trial in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking melatonin 10 mg daily modestly reduces time to symptom resolution and quality of life improvement when compared with placebo (109462). However, it is unclear if any beneficial effects are clinically meaningful. In patients hospitalized and receiving standard care for mild to moderate COVID-19, a small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin 3 mg three times daily for 14 days reduces the mean time to hospital discharge by approximately 3.5 days when compared with placebo. Also, persistent symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and fatigue after 14 days occurred in only 0% to 8% of patients taking melatonin, compared with 15% to 30% of those taking placebo. However, there was no difference in the number of patients with other symptoms, including fever, myalgia, chill, and headache (106300). The validity of this study is limited by its high attrition rate. Another small clinical trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking melatonin (Norm Life Vanatonin Melatonin) 3 mg nightly for 7 days does not reduce symptoms or prevent ICU admission or death when compared with standard care alone (106295). The low dose and short duration of use in this study might have played a role in the lack of benefit.\n\nMelatonin has also been evaluated in patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 3 low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in hospitalized adults with severe- to- critical COVID-19 shows that taking melatonin 10-21 mg daily for 5 to 14 days reduces the odds of in-hospital mortality by approximately 81% when compared with placebo or standard of care alone (116926). The validity of these results is limited by the heterogeneity across clinical studies and the use of aggregate data rather than individual patient data. A large single-center clinical trial shows that taking melatonin 10 mg daily reduces the incidence of thrombosis at day 17 and the incidence of sepsis at day 11 when compared with standard care alone (106289). Another similar study shows that taking melatonin (Danna Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) 5 mg twice daily for 7 days results in invasive mechanical ventilation rates of about 51% compared with 71% in patients given standard care only. There were also modest improvements in the time to improvement of clinical status and lengths of stay in the hospital and ICU (110297). However, the validity of these studies is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nDelirium. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for preventing delirium in hospitalized patients; the available research is conflicting.\nResearch is conflicting on whether melatonin reduces the incidence of delirium. One meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials shows that melatonin reduces the incidence of delirium in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 21% when compared with a control, usually placebo (109696). However, other meta-analyses of 14 small clinical and observational studies of hospitalized patients show that taking melatonin does not reduce the incidence of delirium when compared with control (105003, 112440). Melatonin might be less beneficial in non-acute medical patients when compared with postoperative patients or those in the ICU (105003).\n\nThere is also a lack of consensus within the available research on whether melatonin reduces the duration of delirium in hospitalized patients. One meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials shows that melatonin does not reduce the duration of delirium (109696). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in older hospitalized patients with delirium shows that taking oral melatonin immediate release 5 mg nightly for 5 nights does not reduce the severity of delirium when compared with placebo. Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggests that those with pre-existing cognitive impairment experienced less improvement in delirium but did have improved sleep quality when compared with placebo (114511). However, a meta-analysis of 2 small, randomized controlled trials shows that taking melatonin 3-5 mg daily for 5 or more days reduces the duration of delirium by approximately 2 days when compared with placebo (112051). This analysis is limited by substantial heterogeneity and a lack of dose-response evaluation. Most studies in these analyses have used doses of 0.5-10 mg daily for up to 14 days, although one study used a very high single dose of 50 mg/kg (105003, 105891, 107809, 108949, 109696, 112051).\n\nSome research suggests that melatonin may be beneficial for patients undergoing cardiac procedures. A subgroup analysis of one meta-analysis including 3 small studies suggests that melatonin reduces the incidence of delirium in patients in cardiovascular care units, but not in the general ICU population (112440). Two large clinical studies in the meta-analysis suggest that, in older patients admitted to the ICU after acute heart failure or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), taking melatonin 3 mg once daily for up to 7 days is associated with a 27% incidence of delirium, compared with a 37% to 40% incidence with placebo (107809, 108949). Additionally, a small clinical study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery suggests that taking prolonged-release melatonin (Webber Naturals) 3 mg twice before surgery and twice after surgery reduces the occurrence of delirium over the next 48 hours when compared with placebo (105891). The validity of this study is limited by a high risk of bias due to insufficient blinding and incomplete outcome data.\n\nMelatonin has also been investigated when administered enterally. A small clinical study shows that receiving melatonin 3 mg through a nasogastric tube once at 9 pm, followed by a 0.5 mg hourly maintenance dose for 6 hours during the overnight period, does not reduce delirium or improve sleep when compared with placebo in patients in the ICU that are being weaned off sedatives and mechanical ventilation (104997). Another moderate-sized clinical study in critically ill adults admitted to the ICU shows that administering enteral melatonin 3 mg daily at 9 pm for 7 days or until discharge does not reduce the incidence of continued or new-onset delirium at 24 hours, 3 days, or 7 days after ICU admission when compared with standard care alone (113496).\nless\nDiabetes. Most research shows that oral melatonin is beneficial for improving glycemic control. However, it is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMost research on the use of melatonin for glycemic control has been conducted in mixed populations, such as those with schizophrenia, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or perimenopause (103490, 106294, 106298). Two recent meta-analyses of clinical research in these populations show that taking melatonin modestly reduces fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and improves insulin sensitivity (106294, 106298). The most common doses of melatonin used were 3 -10 mg for 8-24 weeks; however, 10 mg may be more effective (106294, 106298). This contrasts with an earlier meta-analysis showing only modest beneficial effects of melatonin on fasting glucose levels and insulin sensitivity (103490).\n\nResearch on the use of melatonin in patients with type 2 diabetes is limited. One small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking melatonin (NatureMade) 6 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve glycemic control (104368). However, this trial may have been underpowered to detect a difference. Another very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily before bed for 7 days increases absolute glucose level at breakfast on day 7 and the glycemic difference between post-dinner on day 6 and pre-breakfast on day 7 but does not change most measures of glycemic variability including mean glucose levels, pre-prandial glucose levels, and post-prandial glucose levels compared with placebo (112441).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nA clinical study in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy living in Iran shows that taking melatonin 3 mg nightly for 1 week and then 6 mg nightly for 7 weeks, in conjunction with pregabalin 150 mg daily seems to reduce pain and sleep interference to a greater degree than placebo and pregabalin (105895).\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for dry mouth caused by radiation treatment.\nA small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation shows that taking melatonin 20 mg orally at bedtime and using 10 mL of melatonin 0.2% oral gargle 15 minutes before each radiation session does not delay the onset or reduce the incidence of grade 2 dry mouth when compared with placebo. However, the incidence of grade 3 dry mouth is delayed by approximately 16 days (96314).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for dysmenorrhea.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin 10 mg nightly before bed during the week of menstruation has a statistically significant effect on pain severity when compared with placebo. However, the pain reduction was not considered clinically significant (106301).\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for dyspepsia in adults.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 5 mg nightly for 12 weeks improves dyspeptic symptoms in individuals with functional dyspepsia. However, the benefit seems to be decreased in patients with prior Helicobacter pylori infection (62456).\nless\nEndometriosis. It is unclear if oral melatonin reduces endometriosis-related pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 10 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces pain by about 39% and analgesic use by about 46%, as well as pain during menstruation, intercourse, and evacuation, when compared with placebo in adults with endometriosis (89503). Other clinical research in adults with endometriosis shows that taking melatonin 20 mg orally daily does not improve pain scores or reduce pain during intercourse, urination, or defecation when compared with placebo (111464). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nEndotracheal intubation-associated adverse effects. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for endotracheal intubation-related hemodynamic effects.\nClinical research shows that taking immediate-release melatonin (Healthy Hey Nutrition) 6 mg, 2 hours prior to the induction of anesthesia, is as effective as clonidine 0.2 mg for attenuating the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (103483). It is not known if melatonin prevents other adverse effects associated with endotracheal intubation.\nless\nEpilepsy. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for epilepsy in children or adults.\nThere is some low-quality evidence that taking melatonin 3 mg at bedtime for 3 months might reduce the frequency and duration of both nocturnal and daytime seizures in children aged 2-15 years with epilepsy (9699, 9745, 9746, 62785). Also, taking melatonin 1.5 mg before bed for 3 months might reduce the seizure severity in children with epilepsy that is not successfully controlled with other treatment (62754). Furthermore, taking fast-release melatonin 10 mg daily for 3 weeks seems to reduce diurnal seizure frequency in both adults and children aged 9 years and up with intractable epilepsy (88291). However, taking melatonin might not be beneficial for seizure reduction in younger children. In infants and children aged 3 months to 2 years with infantile epileptic spasms syndrome receiving adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and magnesium sulfate, adding on melatonin 3 mg daily for 2 weeks before bedtime does not reduce spasm frequency or improve response rate when compared with placebo (113223).\n\nLimited research has also assessed melatonin as an adjunct therapy in adults with seizure disorders. A small clinical study in adults with epilepsy involving generalized onset motor seizures that recurred within the last three days shows that adding melatonin 3 mg before bed to therapy with valproate 20 mg/kg in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks results in 82% of patients having at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, compared with only 53% of patients in the group taking valproate and placebo. Adding melatonin may also improve seizure severity (105006). However, other clinical research in adults under valproic acid treatment for idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone shows that taking melatonin 3 mg before bed for 8 weeks modestly reduces seizure severity, but not frequency (110299).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3-5 mg daily for up to 60 days may decrease the severity of pain and stiffness, as well as the number of painful joints, in people with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo (9701, 62797).\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for GERD.\nClinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily at bedtime for 8 weeks may improve symptoms of GERD, including heartburn and epigastric pain. However, taking omeprazole 20 mg twice daily seems to be more effective (62723).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for heart failure.\nA meta-analysis of 2 moderate-quality clinical studies in adults with mild to moderate heart failure shows that taking melatonin 10-20 mg daily for 24 weeks improves patient-reported quality of life when compared with placebo. Ejection fraction and stage of heart failure were not improved (116913). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the small number of available clinical trials. Clinical research in this population also shows that taking melatonin improves a composite score reflecting all-cause mortality, hospitalization for exacerbation, and quality of life when compared with placebo. Melatonin also attenuates an increase in serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels, but does not affect left ventricular ejection fraction or left ventricular end-diastolic or end-systolic diameter (108950).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 5 mg twice daily in combination with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 21 days improves ulcer healing rates when compared with omeprazole alone in individuals with H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal ulcers (62803).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for IBS.\nIn patients with IBS who also have poor sleep, taking melatonin 3 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks seems to decrease symptoms of IBS-related abdominal pain and increase the rectal pain threshold when compared with placebo. However, taking melatonin does not seem to influence stool frequency or consistency, bloating, mood, sleep, or overall quality of life (13112). In other small clinical studies, taking melatonin 3 mg at bedtime for 8 weeks decreased severity and frequency of pain, reduced bloating, improved bowel habits, decreased extracolonic symptoms such as headache, heartburn and nausea, and improved overall quality of life when compared with placebo (15216, 62410). However, other clinical research shows that melatonin does not significantly affect the amount of time needed for food to travel through the colon in patients with IBS (62500). Also, one small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 3 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening for 6 months improves abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel habits in 50% to 70% of postmenopausal patients with constipation-predominant IBS when compared with placebo. However, beneficial effects were reduced in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (89510). Other clinical research in patients with IBS shows that taking melatonin 6 mg orally daily for 8 weeks improves IBS symptom severity scores, abdominal pain scores, and bloating scores, when compared with placebo. These results were not different between those with or without sleep disorders at baseline (112055). The large number of endpoints, many with inconsistent results, in these studies makes it difficult to draw conclusions.\nless\nIschemia-reperfusion injury. It is unclear if intravenous or intracoronary melatonin is beneficial for ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nA meta-analysis of 9 low-quality clinical trials in patients with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury shows that giving melatonin in doses of 2-50 mg by intravenous or intracoronary injection within 2.5-3.5 hours of ischemia onset improves left ventricular ejection fraction and reduces the infarct size, but does not improve left ventricular end-diastolic or end-systolic volumes, when compared with control. Also, giving melatonin orally for up to 12 weeks does not improve cardiac function. The patients in this study experienced injury as a result of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, or coronary heart disease (108946).\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving mood and quality of life in patients on hemodialysis.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking immediate-release melatonin 3 mg (Puritans Pride, USA) for 3 months modestly improves depression, anxiety, and quality of life when compared with placebo. After treatment, 73.1% and 57.7% of those taking placebo had severe depression and anxiety, respectively, when compared with 22.2% and 14.8% of those taking melatonin (110291).\nless\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving post-transplant kidney function.\nA small clinical study in patients that have received kidney transplants shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for an average of 25 days does not affect urine volume or kidney function, as measured by the blood urea nitrogen over creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio, when compared with placebo (103693).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nA clinical study in patients who have undergone complete surgical resection of early stage NSCLC shows that taking melatonin 20 mg daily for 1 year does not improve 2-5 year disease-free survival, pain, anxiety, fatigue, or quality of life when compared with placebo (105894). The validity of these findings is limited by a high study withdrawal rate.\nless\nMelasma. Although there has been interest in using oral melatonin for melasma and other causes of hyperpigmentation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of melatonin for these conditions.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving symptoms of menopause; evidence is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 3-5 clinical studies in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking melatonin does not seem to improve vasomotor or psychological symptoms, but may modestly improve physical symptoms, when compared with placebo (105897). This analysis is limited due to inconsistent evidence and some risk of bias within the included studies. Studies included in the meta-analysis used melatonin 3 mg daily for 3-12 months alone or in combination with soy isoflavones 80 mg or fluoxetine 20 mg (11806, 62840, 105897). In contrast, a small study in adults with menopausal symptoms shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 12 weeks improves climacteric symptoms, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and menopausal quality of life and decreases luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels but does not change uterine volume, endometrial thickness, or estradiol levels when compared with placebo (112443).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking melatonin 5 mg nightly for 2 months reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, when compared to baseline (62795). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for MS.\nA small clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) receiving interferon-beta once weekly shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 12 months does not affect relapse rate, disability, brain lesions, fatigue, or depression when compared with placebo (99345). This small study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. A second clinical study in patients with RRMS and receiving treatment shows that taking a specific 3 mg melatonin supplement (Melatonin, Jamieson Laboratories) nightly for 12 weeks modestly improves walking stride length and speed, and patient-reported fatigue, pain and sleep quality scores but not quality of life or fall risk when compared with placebo (116910). A second publication with the same 27 patients found modest improvements in non-dominant limb strength and dexterity, objective cognitive tests, and self-reported mood (116911). The validity of these results is limited by small sample size and the inclusion of only patients with mild disability cases.\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). The benefits of administering oral or intravenous melatonin immediately after an MI are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in patients after MI shows that oral or intravenous melatonin, used in conjunction with medical reperfusion, is associated with modestly lower troponin levels and modestly higher left ventricular ejection fraction when compared with control (105889). One clinical study included in this analysis that evaluated patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) shows that intravenous administration of melatonin 51.7 mcmol over 60 minutes immediately prior to percutaneous coronary intervention, combined with a bolus intracoronary dose of melatonin 8.6 mcmol administered within 60 seconds after restoration of blood flow to the infarcted artery, does not reduce myocardial infarct size when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analyses suggest that the timing of melatonin administration after symptom onset may alter its effects (96324).\nless\nNeonatal encephalopathy. It is unclear if oral or intravenous melatonin is beneficial for neonates with encephalopathy.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in term or late preterm infants with neonatal encephalopathy who are receiving therapeutic hypothermia shows that receiving melatonin 5 mg/kg intravenously daily for 3 days, or 10 mg/kg orally daily for 5 days, does not reduce mortality when compared with hypothermia alone, although a nonsignificant trend towards a reduction was noted (104994). One of those small studies in term infants with neonatal encephalopathy also shows that receiving adjunct oral melatonin treatment results in fewer seizures and less white matter abnormalities when compared with hypothermia alone (99333).\nless\nNocturnal enuresis. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for reducing nighttime wettings.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 5 mg nightly before bedtime for 3 months does not reduce the number of wet beds when compared with placebo in children with nighttime wettings (nocturnal enuresis) (62824).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research, as well as individual clinical trials, show that taking melatonin 6-18 mg daily for 4-56 weeks improves some liver indices, but not others (62853, 88285, 103484, 103485). Overall, taking melatonin seems to modestly reduce levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). However, there is no effect on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) slightly increased (103485). One small clinical study shows that taking melatonin (Nature Made, USA) 6 mg daily for 12 weeks has a small benefit on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference, and liver enzymes, but not plasma lipid levels, when compared with placebo (103484). Larger studies are needed to determine the effect of melatonin in this population.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for improving weight loss.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking melatonin up to 10 mg daily, usually for 4-24 weeks, modestly reduces body weight when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. Also, the studies included in the analysis were not limited to overweight or obese individuals. Populations included those with metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), schizophrenia, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and others, as well as postmenopausal adults (106288). A small clinical trial in overweight or obese individuals shows that although taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces waist circumference and body fat mass when compared with placebo, there is no effect on body weight or BMI (106290).\nless\nOral mucositis. Most research shows that melatonin does not prevent or reduce the severity of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation and chemotherapy. It is unclear if oral or topical melatonin is beneficial in patients with other types of cancer.\nA meta-analysis of seven clinical trials including patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy shows that melatonin does not reduce the rate of oral mucositis when compared with a control, usually placebo (109697). Although a small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation and chemotherapy with cisplatin shows that melatonin delays the onset of severe mucositis by 16 days when compared with placebo (96314), a meta-analysis shows that melatonin does not reduce the rate of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer (109697). A sub-analysis in one meta-analysis suggests that taking melatonin, usually 20 mg daily, reduces the rate of oral mucositis by 53% in patients with cancer types other than head and neck (109697). Most studies investigating the effect of melatonin have used oral melatonin 20 mg at bedtime. However, in one study, 10 mL of melatonin 0.2% oral gargle was also used 15 minutes before radiation (96314). In another, swishing with 10 mL of a melatonin 3% gel mouthwash for 2 minutes and then swallowing, starting 2-3 days before radiotherapy and continuing until 1-4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, was used (105893).\n\nMelatonin has also been investigated for oral mucositis severity. Although some individual research disagrees (96314), a meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that melatonin does not reduce the severity of oral mucositis when compared with placebo. However, the form of melatonin provided in these studies was heterogeneous, including oral, gargle, and gel formulations (96314, 105893, 109697).\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving bone mineral density.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia shows that taking melatonin 3 mg nightly for 1 year increases tibia thickness by 2.2% and volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine by 3.6% when compared with placebo. However, the BMD of other skeletal sites was not impacted. Additionally, a 1 mg melatonin dose was not beneficial (99334).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there has been interest in using oral melatonin for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of melatonin for this condition.\nPain (acute). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for acute pain.\nClinical research in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows that taking melatonin 6 mg two hours before induction with propofol reduces the number of patients requiring intraoperative fentanyl to 10%, compared with 35% of those taking placebo (106299). Also, preliminary clinical research in preterm infants also given standard treatments shows that oral melatonin (Syrup Trunap, Brio Bliss Life Science Pvt. Ltd) 20 minutes prior to retinopathy of prematurity screening, is not inferior to 24% sucrose for reducing pain (110295). However, the effect of sucrose itself is inconclusive and this study is limited by a lack of blinding. Also, it is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for other causes of acute pain.\nless\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for most causes of chronic pain.\nA meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies shows that taking melatonin 3-12 mg daily for up to 12 weeks modestly reduces chronic pain when compared with placebo (103692). However, it is difficult to draw clinical conclusions from this analysis, as it pools the effects observed in various types of chronic pain, including migraine, burning mouth syndrome, endometriosis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral melatonin may improve some measures of periodontitis severity.\nA meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials in patients with periodontitis treated with subgingival instrumentation to remove calculus and bacterial biofilms shows that adding oral melatonin in doses of 3-10 mg daily improves probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and gingival index when compared with instrumentation alone (108953).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for PCOS.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with PCOS shows that taking melatonin 3-10 mg daily for 3-12 weeks does not improve glycemic parameters, hormone levels, lipid levels, weight, or pregnancy rates when compared with placebo (116907). The majority of clinical trials were conducted in Iran. However, a small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 6 mg daily for 8 weeks might modestly reduce testosterone levels (105887). Also, a prospective cohort study in patients with PCOS has found that taking melatonin (Armonia Fast, Nathura) 2 mg before bedtime for 6 months increases follicle-stimulating hormone and the total number of menstrual cycles from approximately 2.5 to 4 when compared to baseline (96313). The validity of this study is limited by its observational nature and the lack of a comparator group.\n\nMelatonin has also been evaluated in patients with PCOS taking metformin. A clinical study shows that taking melatonin (Razak Pharmaceutical Company) 3 mg daily for 12 weeks, with or without sildenafil, does not have an effect on acne, insulin, testosterone, weight, or most measures of sexual function, when compared with metformin alone (116927).\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for reducing PONV.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin (Nature Made, USA) 3 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg, one hour prior to lumbar discectomy surgery does not reduce postoperative nausea when compared with placebo (110294).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for reducing pain postoperatively.\nThree meta-analyses, as well as most individual clinical studies, show that taking melatonin in addition to standard therapy modestly alleviates pain and reduces analgesic use after surgery when compared with placebo (62471, 62512, 62551, 62743, 88293, 88294, 103488, 103691, 103692, 105892)(110294, 111462). However, any benefit is likely to be small and may not be clinically relevant (103488, 109701, 111462). Melatonin has been used in doses of 1-10 mg daily for a duration of 1-21 days, usually starting the night before surgery (62471, 62512, 62743, 103488, 103691, 105892, 110294, 111462). This research is limited by poor methodology, as well as the heterogeneity of the included studies. The studies evaluated melatonin across a wide variety of surgeries, including abdominal hysterectomy, cataract surgery, cesarean section, prostatectomy, lumbar laminectomy, lumbar discectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, wisdom teeth extraction, and corrective jaw surgery.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral melatonin improves the rate of recovery after surgery.\nIn females undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy, taking extended-release melatonin 5 mg, 90 minutes before surgery, shortens hospital stay to a mean of 2.7 days, compared with 3.4 days for placebo (108945).\nless\nPostoperative sleep disturbance. It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for improving postoperative sleep disturbance.\nA meta-analysis of randomized trials in adults undergoing anesthesia for surgery shows that taking melatonin 5-12 mg orally or sublingually or ramelteon 8 mg orally daily for 1-6 days does not improve sleep scores or sleep time when compared with placebo or no intervention (112052). In addition, a small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin (Nature Made) 5 mg each night before bed for 4 weeks, starting 2 weeks after surgery for orthopedic trauma, does not reduce postoperative sleep disturbance when compared with placebo. All patients were also given education related to sleep hygiene (110293).\nless\nPostural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial for POTS.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with POTS shows that taking a single dose of melatonin 3 mg reduces sitting and standing heart rate, after 2 and 4 hours, when compared with placebo. However, melatonin does not appear to affect blood pressure or orthostatic symptoms (88292). It is unclear if melatonin is beneficial when taken as more than a single dose.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral melatonin reduces the severity of pre-eclampsia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with pre-eclampsia shows that taking sustained-release melatonin 10 mg with vitamin B6 10 mg three times daily, starting during recruitment and continuing until delivery, attenuates the need to increase the dose of antihypertensive medication on certain days, but does not affect overall pre-eclampsia severity, when compared with control (99341).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral melatonin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study conducted in Spain in adults with normal menstrual cycles shows that taking a combination product containing melatonin 1 mg, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), rhodiola, vitex agnus-castus, and vitamin B6 (Premen-Calm, Naturlider S.A., Spain) before bed starting on the day of menstruation onset for 3 months does not improve somatic or affective PMS symptoms, pain, need for analgesics, mood, quality of life, or subjective sleep quality when compared with placebo (114509).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral melatonin has only been evaluated in combination with medication; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with metastatic prostate cancer that is refractory or resistant to treatment with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue triptorelin shows that taking melatonin 20 mg daily in combination with intramuscular triptorelin injected every 28 days can decrease levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and growth factors for prostate cancer when compared to baseline (7255). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPruritus. Small clinical trials suggest that oral melatonin might be beneficial for some types of pruritus.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with pruritus due to various types of chronic liver disease shows that taking melatonin 10 mg nightly for 2 weeks modestly reduces the severity, frequency, and extent of pruritus when compared with placebo (106297). Another small clinical study in patients undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking melatonin 10 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces the severity of pruritus and reduces the affected body area when compared with placebo (104996).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical melatonin is beneficial for psoriasis.\nA very small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis shows that applying melatonin 5% cream twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce psoriasis severity when compared with placebo (114513). The validity of this result is limited by the small sample size.\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical melatonin is beneficial for radiation-related dermatitis.\nIn females with breast cancer, a small clinical study shows that applying a specific melatonin emulsion cream (Praevoskin, PraevoMed GmbH) twice daily during radiation treatment and continuing for another 2 weeks results in fewer cases of grade 1 or 2 acute radiation dermatitis when compared with placebo (99336). In contrast, another clinical trial in patients with breast cancer shows that applying a cream providing melatonin 25 mg and dimethylsulfoxide 150 mg twice daily during and for 3 weeks after radiation treatment does not improve quality of life or breast symptoms at the end of treatment when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in breast symptoms over time (110298). Other preliminary clinical research in adults receiving radiation for breast cancer shows that applying melatonin cream 25 mg/gram twice daily throughout radiation therapy does not improve radiation dermatitis scores or reduce the need for adjunctive treatment when compared with placebo (112056).\nless\nRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for RBD.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 3 mg before bed for 4 weeks increases the likelihood of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in patients with RBD when compared with placebo (62762). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size.\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for RLS.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 3 mg before bedtime does not improve symptoms of RLS and may actually worsen motor symptoms in individuals with RLS when compared with baseline (62753). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for RA.\nA small clinical study in patients with RA shows that taking melatonin 6 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect disease activity or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) when compared with placebo (105890).\nless\nSarcoidosis. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 20 mg daily for one year, followed by 10 mg daily for another year, improves lung function and skin lesions in patients with chronic sarcoidosis when compared with baseline (62435). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for schizophrenia or for attenuating the adverse effects associated with antipsychotic medications.\nSome clinical research shows that taking melatonin orally 3 mg each evening for 8 weeks reduces the weight gain and increased waist circumference associated with olanzapine when compared with placebo. It also seems to improve some symptoms of schizophrenia (88296). Other clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of slow-release melatonin (Cronocaps, Productos Medix) 5 mg each evening for 8 weeks reduces adverse effects from second generation antipsychotics, such as increased diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference, when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to improve symptoms of schizophrenia (88300).\nless\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for SAD.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that oral melatonin, 0.25-2 mg taken daily for 3 weeks, may decrease winter depression symptoms in patients with SAD (10670, 62308). However, sublingual melatonin 0.5 mg daily for 6 days does not appear to improve this condition (62388). Reasons for these discrepancies may include the duration of treatment, route of administration, or the severity of SAD at baseline.\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for sepsis in neonates or adults.\nThere is conflicting research about the effect of melatonin on neonatal sepsis. While some preliminary research in Egypt shows that giving a single dose of melatonin 20 mg in addition to antibiotics reduces sepsis severity, another more recent study did not find a difference in outcomes between groups receiving antibiotics only or antibiotics with melatonin (99339, 99340).\n\nIn adults with early septic shock given standard care, a small clinical trial shows that taking melatonin 50 mg daily for 5 days increases the number of ventilator-free days by 6.9 and the number of vasopressor-free days by 2.6. ICU and hospital lengths of stay were reduced by 5.25 and 6.9 days, respectively. However, after 28 days there was no significant difference in the mortality rate, the number of patients requiring ventilation or renal replacement therapy, or the number of patients recovered from organ dysfunction (106296).\n\nIntravenous melatonin has also been investigated. A small clinical trial in patients with severe sepsis shows that a continuous infusion of melatonin, 60 mg over 24 hours, for 5 days following post-surgical sepsis diagnosis modestly reduces sepsis severity when compared with placebo. Hospital stay was reduced by approximately 5.2 days in patients given melatonin; however, it is unclear if this difference is statistically significant (110300).\nless\nSmoking cessation. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial in patients trying to quit smoking.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 0.35 mg as a single oral dose 3.5 hours after initiation of nicotine withdrawal in smokers seems to reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, irritability, depression, and cigarette craving over the next 10 hours when compared with baseline (2424). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nStabbing headache. Although there has been interest in using oral melatonin for stabbing headaches, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of melatonin for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for stress reduction.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg one hour prior to stress modestly improves memory accuracy during a laboratory-induced stressful situation when compared with placebo (62509).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for this condition.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking melatonin orally 10 mg daily for 6 weeks decreases symptoms by 24% to 30% in patients with tardive dyskinesia when compared with placebo (7082). However, other small clinical studies show that taking melatonin 2-20 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not reduce abnormal, involuntary movement in patients with tardive dyskinesia when compared with placebo (62146, 62825).\nless\nTension headache. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for reducing the frequency of tension headaches.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic tension headache shows that taking a specific melatonin supplement (Melaxen) 3 mg nightly for 30 days seems to reduce headache severity and reduce the median number of days with a headache by 6 when compared with baseline (104998). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for improving tinnitus intensity or severity.\nSome clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg nightly for one month reduces tinnitus intensity and improves the quality of sleep in individuals with chronic tinnitus when compared with placebo. The effect seems to be greatest in men, those who have not received prior treatment for tinnitus, and those with a history of noise exposure (62820). Other clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 3 months is more effective for reducing tinnitus severity than sertraline 50 mg daily (97447). However, other clinical research shows that taking melatonin 3 mg nightly for 30-40 days does not significantly reduce tinnitus intensity when compared with placebo, although the effects might be significant when melatonin is combined with sulpiride or sulodexide (62469, 62614).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral melatonin is beneficial for children who have experienced a concussion.\nA small clinical study in children ages 8-18 years who have experienced a concussion shows that taking melatonin 3 mg or 10 mg one hour before bedtime for 28 days does not improve persistent post-concussive symptoms when compared with placebo (103690). One small observational study in children in the same age group who have experienced a concussion within 14 days has found that receiving a prescription for melatonin is not associated with improved symptoms and recovery at 15-35 days after concussion (105001). The validity of these findings is limited by small study size and short duration of follow-up.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral melatonin may be modestly beneficial for reducing symptoms or sustaining remission in patients using the medication mesalazine.\nA small clinical study shows that taking melatonin 5 mg daily in combination with mesalazine 1 gram twice daily for 12 months may help to sustain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis when compared with mesalazine alone (62821). Another small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking melatonin 3 mg daily for 3 months modestly improves overall symptoms, some measures of quality of life, and levels of fecal calprotectin when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on other markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (106303).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate melatonin for these uses.",

Clinical studies that have evaluated melatonin have used both slow-release and fast-release formulations. Some of these formulations have been authenticated with certificates of analyses (89503, 89508) or have met the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for identity, purity, dose, and stability (89502).\n\nIn the European Union and some other countries, a prescription prolonged-release melatonin product (2 mg, Circadin, Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd) is available for treating insomnia in patients 55 years and older. The tablets should not be crushed. There is also a small diameter prolonged-release tablet for pediatric patients (PedPRM, Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd), helping to facilitate swallowing in children (96318).\n\nAn analysis of melatonin products available in Canada, including single-ingredient and combination products containing L-theanine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and/or herbal ingredients, such as lavender, chamomile, valerian, lemon balm, and others, demonstrated high lot-to-lot variability. Melatonin content ranged from -83% to +478% of the labeled quantity. Serotonin, a possible by-product of melatonin biosynthesis or degradation, was found in about 27% of tested products at levels of up to 74.3 mcg/mL (108144). Analyses of gummy products declaring melatonin on the label available in the United States found that one product claiming a melatonin dose of 5 mg per serving did not contain detectable levels of melatonin. The actual quantity of melatonin in the remaining products ranged from 74% to 347% of the labeled quantity, with only 12% of products containing melatonin amounts within 10% of the declared quantity. Only one sample of each brand was analyzed (110328).",

However, other research suggests that melatonin might impair glucose utilization and increase insulin resistance (9713), while other research has found no effect on glucose levels (19036, 104368). Until more is known, use melatonin cautiously in combination with antidiabetes drugs.\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review))\nTheoretically, taking melatonin with antihypertensive drugs might increase the risk of hypotension or hypertension.\nSome clinical research suggests that taking melatonin decreases blood pressure in healthy adults (1724, 62165, 62187, 63042). Also, melatonin seems to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure at nighttime or untreated essential hypertension (62359, 62416, 62441, 62826). However, melatonin seems to worsen blood pressure in patients who are taking antihypertensive medications. Immediate-release melatonin 5 mg at night in combination with nifedipine GITS (Procardia XL) increases systolic blood pressure an average of 6.5 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure by an average of 4.9 mmHg, and heart rate by 3.9 bpm (6436). Also, results from animal research suggest that melatonin reduces the effectiveness of certain antihypertensive drugs, including methoxamine and clonidine (62432).\nless\nCAFFEINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking caffeine with melatonin might increase levels of melatonin.\nSome evidence suggests that caffeine consumption can decrease endogenous melatonin levels (8265, 22303, 37585), while other evidence suggests that caffeine increases endogenous melatonin levels (62328). When administered in combination with melatonin supplements, caffeine seems to increase melatonin effects and levels (62352, 96315). The reason for this discrepancy is not completely clear. Part of the discrepancy may result from the fact that caffeine can inhibit melatonin synthesis as well as inhibit melatonin metabolism. By functioning as an adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine may indirectly inhibit the synthesis of melatonin. Conversely, because melatonin and caffeine are both metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, concomitant use of melatonin and caffeine may reduce the metabolism of melatonin, resulting in higher serum levels (22306, 96315).\nless\nCNS DEPRESSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, taking melatonin might increase the sedative effects of CNS depressants.\nMelatonin has sedative effects.

Also, other CYP1A2 substrates might decrease the metabolism of melatonin, increasing melatonin levels.\nMelatonin is metabolized in the liver primarily by the CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 enzymes (62118, 62405, 96315). Theoretically, combined administration of melatonin with drugs metabolized by the CYP1A2 enzyme might reduce the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased serum levels.

In some cases, fluvoxamine might increase bioavailability of exogenously administered melatonin by up to 20 times (5038, 6499, 8251). Some researchers think this might be a beneficial interaction and be potentially useful for cases of refractory insomnia (6499). However, this interaction might also cause unwanted excessive drowsiness and possibly other adverse effects. Fluvoxamine is known to increase endogenous melatonin secretion (6498, 22313). It seems to increase serum levels of exogenously administered melatonin possibly by decreasing melatonin metabolism by inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1A2 and 2C19 or by inhibiting melatonin elimination.

However, multiple case reports and some clinical research suggests that melatonin actually reduces the incidence of seizure (1699, 9746, 62123, 62256, 63070, 63071).\nless\nTRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS\nTheoretically, melatonin might have immunostimulant effects; until more is known, avoid in transplant recipients.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nIn the US, cases of pediatric overdose have been reported to poison control centers. From 2012 to 2021, over 260,000 pediatric melatonin ingestions were reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS). In 2021, melatonin accounted for 4.9% of all ingestions, compared with only 0.6% in 2012. Most cases were related to unintentional ingestions in children 5 years and under and were asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, the most common symptoms were related to the central nervous system, followed by the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Over 4,000 children required hospitalization and almost 300 required intensive care. Also, five children required mechanical ventilation and two children under age five died following unintentional exposure (108145). The dose of melatonin consumed in these cases is unknown. Also, in one case report, a 3-month-old infant who received 8-10 dissolvable melatonin 5 mg tablets daily for an unknown duration was found unresponsive. The child's twin also received similar doses of melatonin without incident. The deceased infant had a melatonin level of 1400 ng/mL, whereas average nocturnal melatonin levels in infants and toddlers are around 0.325 ng/mL. The researchers could not definitively state that melatonin caused this infant's death, citing a lack of evidence on the physiologic effects and reference lab values for melatonin in infants (102514).\n\nPossible melatonin toxicity has also been reported in adults, although in most cases melatonin was taken in addition to other psychotropic medications during a suicide attempt (62822, 112439). In one case, a psychotic episode was reported in a 73-year-old female who took a large amount (possibly an overdose) of melatonin (63030).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with melatonin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, melatonin supplementation increases plasma levels of melatonin, occasionally into the daylight hours (7081, 62424, 62439, 62807, 62787, 62908, 62917, 63013). The bioavailability of synthetic melatonin varies widely, with significant interpatient variability (97436). The calculated oral bioavailability of melatonin from supplements has ranged between 3% to 76% (1126, 62908, 62917, 63013). Within about 1 hour, doses between 1-5 mg lead to serum concentrations 10-100 times those of the usual night-time peak (105005, 109698). Lower oral doses such as 0.1-0.3 mg, taken at daytime, lead to peak serum concentrations that are in the normal night-time range (105005). When administered in gelatin capsules, melatonin reaches peak levels after 40 to 150 minutes. The peak levels are 350-10,000 times higher than nighttime concentrations (62916, 62917, 97436). In human research, the average peak serum concentration is 2630 pg/mL following a 2.5 mg dose, 3550.5 pg/mL following a 10 mg dose, and 64,730 pg/mL following a 75 mg dose (62524, 97436). The mean elimination half-life is 40.8 minutes in healthy volunteers (97436) and 1.8 to 2.1 hours in older adults (92848). Most studies show that levels return to baseline in about 4-8 hours (105005, 109698). In healthy patients, a 2 mg dose of a prolonged-release melatonin formulation led to near physiological plasma levels which were sustained for 5-7 hours (96321). Taking a specific prolonged-release tablet (Oniria) results in levels of melatonin that are above normal endogenous levels for at least 8.5 hours (109698). In older adults with insomnia complaints, the time to maximum level, which was 1.3 to 1.5 hours, did not change when doses of 0.4 mg and 2 mg were compared (62848). The maximum concentrations were 405 ± 93 pg/mL and 3999 ± 700 pg/mL (0.4 mg and 2 mg doses, respectively). Use of melatonin 2 mg resulted in a maintenance of melatonin levels >50 pg/mL for an average of 10 hours.\n\nThe physiologic half-life of melatonin is approximately 30-60 minutes (1072, 1742, 62905, 62917, 63013, 96318). Nutritional supplements do not appear to mimic the physiologic release of melatonin, as dissolution testing has ranged from 4 to 12 hours (63066, 96317), with controlled-release formulations available (62122). The time delay between administration and maximal effect varies linearly from 220 minutes at noon, to 60 minutes at 9 p.m. (63093).\n\nMelatonin may also be delivered transdermally (1058, 62946, 97448, 103489), intravesically, rectally, vaginally (103489), or transmucosally (1058) to mimic physiological activity. Time to maximal concentrations range from 24 minutes with rectal administration to 21 hours with transdermal administration (103489). When a cream containing 12.5% melatonin was applied to 80% of the body surface area of healthy adults, an average peak serum level of 4,977.2 ± 10,369.6 pg/mL was reached at 12 hours (97448).\nDistribution\nMelatonin levels in saliva are one-quarter to one-third of those in serum and may be used to estimate levels in plasma (62737, 62845, 62852, 62890, 108953) and gingival crevicular fluid (62737). Melatonin has also been found in platelets (62790). Melatonin is very lipid-soluble and readily passes through the blood-brain barrier (62243, 62477, 96322, 108949). The volume of distribution for intravenously administered melatonin is 1.2 L/kg (97436).\nMetabolism\nMelatonin is metabolized in the liver via the hepatic microsome cytochrome P450 system, primarily (but not exclusively) by the CYP2C19 and CYP1A family (particularly CYP1A2) and possibly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (6498, 48439, 62118, 62174, 62405, 96315). First-pass hepatic metabolism, which is extensive (up to 60% of the oral dose) (but can be avoided with the sublingual formulation), includes 6-hydroxylation, followed by conjugation and excretion as the sulfate or glucuronide, and is extensive (62908, 62917, 63013, 96315). Melatonin is deacetylated in the pineal gland and retina to 5-methoxytryptamine (96315). The 6-sulphatoxymelatonin metabolite of melatonin is inactive (62896, 62920) and can be determined in serum (62896, 62920) and saliva (1743, 62845, 62890). In patients with liver cirrhosis, melatonin levels are elevated compared to controls due to reduced metabolism (62405, 63026).\n\nIn case studies in patients with insomnia, a loss of response to melatonin treatment was found to be associated with a slow melatonin metabolism (62765). The authors suggested that in some patients, there may be decreased activity of CYP1A2, resulting in decreased melatonin metabolism and therefore persistent melatonin in plasma at levels of >50 pg/mL up to four hours after supplementation.\nExcretion\nUrine melatonin levels were found to correlate well with plasma levels (8239). Up to 85% of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate was excreted in urine (1751) with a physiologic excretion of 11.1 to 40.2 mcg (19.0 ± 7.4 mcg) in children (62392). In human research, consumption of diets enriched with Jerte Valley cherries (a food source of melatonin) increased urinary levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (62761). In older adults, oral doses of 0.4 mg and 2 mg resulted in an apparent total clearance of 379-478 L/hr (62848). When delivered orally, intravenously, transdermally, intravesically, rectally, or vaginally, the elimination half-life ranged from 45-47 minutes with oral or intravenous administration up to 14.6 hours with transdermal administration (103489, 105005).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMelatonin is a hormone synthesized endogenously in the pineal gland (1123, 1773, 62288). It is produced from tryptophan, which is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan, then to serotonin, then to N-acetylserotonin, and finally to melatonin (1773). The synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland depends on the norepinephrine-induced stimulation of post-synaptic pineal beta-1 adrenoreceptors and alpha-1 adrenoreceptors (1773, 1780, 62173, 62868, 62877, 62885, 62924, 62926), while alpha-2 adrenoreceptors appear to function as downregulators of melatonin synthesis (62869, 62878). The norepinephrine-induced increase in activity and number of alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenoreceptors increases the activity of the enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of melatonin production from serotonin (1773). Following synthesis, melatonin is collected by the venous capillary system, then secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and the venous systemic circulation (1123, 8239). In the brain, melatonin appears to increase the binding of gamma-aminobenzoic acid (GABA) to its receptors by affecting membrane characteristics, not by increasing the number of receptors. Melatonin may decrease neurotransmission by a direct effect on nerve cells (9695).\n\nMelatonin's primary role seems to be regulation of the body's circadian rhythm, endocrine secretions, and sleep patterns (1773, 7043). Circadian rhythm of melatonin begins at the end of the neonatal period (62278, 62339). Endogenous melatonin is also involved in several other functions including growth hormone secretion and sexual maturation (1776, 1777, 1778, 6497, 8246), pain control, balance, and sexual activity (1776, 1777, 1778, 6497). However, it does not appear to directly affect heart function or blood pressure (9714).\n\nExcretion of melatonin is similar in males and females (9747). Melatonin release peaks between one to three years of age. Nocturnal serum melatonin levels naturally decline with increasing pubertal stages (1781, 8246, 8263). Melatonin suppression by light is not affected by age (1775, 62157). However, there is good evidence that melatonin levels can be abnormally low in certain conditions or disease states. Since light inhibits melatonin secretion and darkness stimulates its secretion (1773, 62205, 62887, 62928, 63015), people who suffer from an insufficient amount of environmental light often have decreased endogenous melatonin secretion (8247). Infants with low melatonin production are more likely to experience a life-threatening event (ALTE) (8262). Insomniacs of all ages can also have decreased melatonin levels. Patients with sleep disorders related to other conditions, such as fibromyalgia and depression, can also have low levels (6498). Recent information also shows that music therapy can improve endogenous serum melatonin levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease, possibly a contributing factor to patients' relaxed and calm mood (8241). Also, some research suggests that meditation techniques might increase endogenous melatonin concentrations (9748). In other conditions, melatonin's response to light can be altered. For example, in patients with bipolar I disorder, melatonin response to light appears to be abnormal, but is not affected in less severe bipolar II disorder or unipolar depression (1123).\nAnalgesic effects\nSome clinical evidence shows that melatonin may reduce pain associated with conditions such as endometriosis (89503), temporomandibular disorder (89508), fibromyalgia (9701, 62797), gastroesophageal reflux disease (62723), irritable bowel syndrome (13112, 15216, 62410, 89510), migraine headaches (6712, 12149), and post-operative recovery (62471, 62512, 62743). Antinociceptive activity of melatonin may be related to the activation of MT1 and MT2 receptors, which reduces cyclic AMP formation and lessens pain; the opening of potassium channels; the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression; and the indirect activation of opioid receptors (62543). However, there does not appear to be a clear relationship between pain perception and urinary concentrations of melatonin metabolites (9700).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, melatonin had anti-inflammatory effects in infants with respiratory distress (62366), or in adults with COVID-19 (106300), sepsis (110300), or diabetes (116909). In animal research, melatonin has been reported to reduce cardiac inflammatory injury induced by acute exercise (62624). Also in both human and laboratory research, melatonin has been reported to decrease the upregulation of or suppress levels of proinflammatory cytokines (62171, 62520, 62557, 62606, 62669, 62693, 62741, 62787, 116909). Potential mechanisms of action may include the inhibition of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) production or an increase of glutathione levels (62220, 62252); the inhibition of phospholipase A2 (62575), mitogen-activated protein kinases (62522), or NF-kappaB (62610, 62624, 62626, 62741); or the regulation of mast cells (62701).\n\nHowever, some conflicting evidence from clinical research shows that melatonin may not have anti-inflammatory effects. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, melatonin induced a proinflammatory response, increasing levels of certain inflammatory cytokines, as well as plasma kynurenine concentrations (62460). Also, in patients with ulcerative colitis, melatonin does not reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (106303).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, nocturnal endogenous plasma melatonin levels have been shown to be higher in obese subjects vs. nonobese subjects and lean nondiabetic controls (62856). However, some evidence from animal and human research suggests that melatonin may play a role in body weight control (62635, 106288). Some evidence from animal models suggests that melatonin inhibits adipocyte differentiation (62635) or reduces gut motility, causing a decrease in appetite (62599). Other animal research has indicated that exogenous melatonin lacks an effect on leptin secretion (62707).\nAntiaging effects\nMelatonin has been identified as countering some of the deleterious effects of aging (62572, 62593, 62611, 62615, 62616, 62631, 62660, 62724). Evidence from animal research suggests that melatonin may reduce age-related neurodegeneration by reducing oxidative stress-related impairments and apoptosis that occur in the brain during the aging process (62523). Other animal research has indicated that melatonin may improve longevity (cellular and otherwise) by preventing age-related mitochondrial impairment (62611), maintaining youthful rhythmic activity (62593), improving monoaminergic neurotransmission (62722), and reversing immunosenescence (62567, 62565). An experimental model of age-induced neuronal apoptosis indicated that melatonin may exert a protective effect via prosurvival Akt and prevention of DNA damage (62538).\nAntiarthritic effects\nIn vitro, melatonin has beneficial effects on articular chondrocytes, enhancing the synthesis of the cartilage matrix (62519). Melatonin also inhibits the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, involved in other types of arthritis (62596).\nAntibacterial effects\nPreliminary evidence shows that melatonin alone or in combination with isoniazid (INH) is active against some Mycobacterium species (330).\nAnticancer effects\nAccording to the \"melatonin hypothesis\" of cancer, the exposure to light at night and anthropogenic electric and magnetic fields may be related to the increased incidence of cancer and childhood leukemia via melatonin disruption (7042, 62447). Patients with endometrial cancer have been found to have melatonin plasma levels that are six times lower than tumor-free controls (62190, 63040). Postmenopausal adults with breast cancer have also been found to have lower levels of melatonin when compared with cancer-free controls (101257). Furthermore, some earlier observational research has found that females with estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer have lower plasma melatonin levels than those with ER- or PR-negative breast cancer (62906). There is some clinical evidence that taking combined high-dose melatonin with conventional chemotherapy or with interleukin-2 (IL-2) might improve tumor regression rate in patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, or colon cancer (1692, 5854, 5855, 5857, 7040, 7043, 8268, 62407, 62844).\n\nThe anticancer effects of melatonin are not entirely clear. In animal models, melatonin appears to protect against the formation of mammary tumors (62321). In vitro, at pharmacological concentrations, melatonin exhibits cytotoxic activity in cancer cells (62211, 62248). Melatonin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of various types of cancer cells (1064, 5856, 7040, 9751, 62154, 62158, 62197, 62330, 62893, 62934). At both physiological and pharmacological concentrations, melatonin acts as a differentiating agent in some cancer cells and lowers their invasive and metastatic capabilities through alterations in adhesion molecules and maintenance of gap junctional intercellular communication (62211). In other cancer cell types, melatonin, either alone or in combination with other agents, induces apoptotic cell death.\n\nBiochemical and molecular mechanisms of melatonin's oncostatic action may include regulation of estrogen receptor expression and transactivation, calcium/calmodulin activity, protein kinase C activity, cytoskeletal architecture and function, intracellular pH, melatonin receptor-mediated signal transduction cascades, and fatty acid transport and metabolism (62211). These and other possible anticancer mechanisms may include or operate by modulation of apoptosis (62496, 62533, 62592, 62605, 62629, 62650), downregulation of HIF-1 alpha expression (antiangiogenic) (62607), antiestrogenic effects (62590, 62658, 62747), increase in estrogen receptor activity in breast tumors (62921) and decreased expression of estrogen receptors (9711, 62828), antiproliferative effects (62587, 62674), suppression of linoleic acid uptake and metabolism (62583), SIRT1 inhibition (62572), cytoskeletal dynamics (inhibition of cancer cell migration) (62487, 62556), epigenetic regulation (62505), reduction of oxidative stress (62711, 62828), enhanced IL-2-induced lymphocytosis (2568), modulation of melatonin receptor expression (62667), stimulation of expression of the growth-inhibitory factor, TGF-beta (62312, 62934), nuclear signaling via nuclear RZR/ROR receptors (62296), aromatase activity (62828), G-protein coupled membrane receptors, or via retinoid orphan receptors with involvement of the calcium signaling pathway (62180), and stimulation of melatonin receptors and associated biomolecular cascades (62715).\n\nMelatonin also appears to affect hormones that influence cancer cell growth. For example, it seems to reduce levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and prolactin (PRL), which have a role in breast cancer and prostate cell proliferation (1064, 5854, 5855, 5857, 7043, 7255). Melatonin might also improve survival in patients with cancer by preventing the immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy (7040) or preventing thrombocytopenia associated with cancer chemotherapy by preventing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of bone marrow cells, and acting synergistically with cytokines to stimulate platelet generation (2564).\n\nHowever, some conflicting research has not shown that melatonin has oncostatic effects against MCF-7 cells or ZR-75-1 and T-47D cell lines (62340).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nThe relationship between melatonin and seizure risk is controversial. Both anticonvulsant (62318, 62525, 63071, 63081) and proconvulsant (9695) properties have been associated with melatonin in preclinical studies. The production of melatonin is increased in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. This observation may be explained in two contradictory ways. The brain may be attempting to reduce epileptic nerve transmissions by increasing the concentration of melatonin (9696). In contrast, it may be that melatonin has proconvulsant activity. Concentrations of melatonin are increased at night and there is also an increased incidence of seizures during the night (9697). It is thought that melatonin might increase seizure activity by affecting the activity of dopamine in the brain (9744). However, many people with seizures have low endogenous melatonin levels, which increase after a seizure occurs. This suggests that melatonin levels increase to compensate for the increased nerve activity that occurs during a seizure (8249). In addition, some anticonvulsant medications increase concentrations of endogenous melatonin (9698), and exogenous melatonin may be used to treat some types of epilepsy (9699). Until more is known about the potential for melatonin to increase seizure activity, it should be avoided in people with seizure disorders (9744).\n\nIn animals, intraventricular injection of antimelatonin antibody has elicited transitory epileptiform abnormalities in the electroencephalogram (62915). Proposed mechanisms of action include altered brain GABAergic neurotransmission, interactions with benzodiazepine brain receptors, tryptophan metabolite activity, free radical scavenger activity, or modulation of brain amino acids and nitric oxide (NO) production (9695, 62318, 62415).\nAntidiabetic effects\nMelatonin supplementation may impact blood sugar levels both positively and negatively. Although some research has found that melatonin supplementation does not affect glucose levels (19036, 63079), melatonin has been reported to elevate blood sugar levels in patients with type 1 diabetes (63036). Also, in postmenopausal patients, low doses of melatonin have reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (9713). Furthermore, a large melatonin bolus might also reduce insulin sensitivity. A small clinical study in healthy adult males shows that taking four doses of melatonin 10 mg hourly seems to temporarily reduce insulin sensitivity, but does not affect other glycemic parameters, when compared with placebo (103690).\n\nHowever, some conflicting evidence has shown beneficial effects. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had a suboptimal response to the oral hypoglycemic agent metformin, melatonin and zinc acetate administration improved impaired fasting and postprandial glycemic control and decreased the level of glycated hemoglobin (19034, 19035). Beneficial effects on glucose levels and insulin sensitivity have also been reported in animal models (62709). Although the mechanism of action is not entirely clear, melatonin may stimulate glycogen synthesis via the PKCzeta-Akt-GSK3beta pathway (62670) as well as inhibit insulin secretion via stimulation of melatonin receptors in pancreatic islet cells (19038). In animal research, melatonin has been suggested as influencing gene expression in insulinoma beta-cells (62618).\n\nInterestingly, endogenous melatonin levels have also shown some correlation with blood glucose levels. However, although endogenous melatonin levels are negatively correlated with plasma levels of insulin, glucose, and leptin in patients with metabolic syndrome (62851), in patients with type 2 diabetes, nocturnal plasma melatonin levels were higher in obese subjects vs. nonobese subjects and lean nondiabetic controls (62856).\nAntioxidant effects\nMany of melatonin's proposed therapeutic or preventive uses are based on its antioxidant activity (10671, 62120, 62191, 62216, 62227, 62239, 62240, 62245, 62251, 62258)(62265, 62273, 62274, 62277, 62279, 62282, 62284, 62285, 62286, 62292)(62293, 62295, 62297, 62299, 62300, 62305, 62306, 62311, 62319, 62322)(62326, 62460, 62471, 63087, 63091, 63092). Preliminary data suggest that melatonin may decrease oxidative renal damage caused by cisplatin (9749). Antioxidant, or free radical-scavenging properties of melatonin have been shown in laboratory and human research against both reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (62202, 62212, 62216, 62238, 62240, 62251, 62279, 62286, 62292, 62295)(62349, 62477, 62621, 62672, 62673, 62718, 62750, 62763, 62774, 62795)(62809, 62813, 62839, 62858, 63091, 63092, 109700, 110300). Melatonin may reduce oxidative damage under a variety of conditions in which excessive free radical generation is believed to be involved (30066, 62191, 62516, 62531, 62546, 62557, 62559, 62563, 62564, 62582)(62626, 62632, 62634, 62639, 62644, 62648, 62653, 62678, 62683, 62688)(62692, 62726, 62733, 62735, 62736, 62738, 62744, 63087), including animal models of ischemia and reperfusion injury (10671, 62120, 62227, 62239, 62245, 62258, 62265, 62273, 62274, 62277)(62282, 62284, 62285, 62293, 62297, 62299, 62300, 62305, 62306, 62311)(62319, 62322, 62326, 62485, 62492, 62527, 62534, 62536, 62550, 62555)(62562, 62566, 62568, 62603, 62625, 62641, 62666, 62698, 62739, 62740), as well as in nerve tissues, including brain, spinal cord, optic nerve, and spinal cord white matter (62263), and for protection against UV-induced erythema or other damage (1769, 62254, 63086), protection against stroke-induced neurologic damage (10671, 32513, 62203, 62219, 62236, 62253, 62273, 62322), reduced oxidation during blood storage (62842), or protection against other toxins, including heavy metals and radiation (62159, 62176, 62185, 62198, 62209, 62210, 62228, 62247, 62283, 62293)(62300, 62306, 62323, 62326, 62931, 62976, 63051, 63056). Melatonin has been reported as being a more efficient antioxidant than glutathione (62294), vitamin C (62235, 62255), or vitamin E (7082, 62279, 62314, 62944, 62953, 62974, 63088) and synergy has been observed with other antioxidants (62264, 62292). In human research, other potential antioxidant effects of melatonin include an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase (62378, 62382, 116909). As a result, melatonin has been proposed as a supplement to prevent or treat many conditions that are associated with oxidative damage.\n\nHowever, a clinical study in preterm neonates shows that oral administration of a single dose of melatonin 0.5 mg/kg at birth does not improve biomarkers of oxidative stress injury at 24 and 48 hours when compared with placebo (107808). Also, animal and other laboratory research has demonstrated a lack of antioxidant effects (62249, 62266, 62768, 62781, 62805). Negative effects have even been shown in some research. In animals, melatonin injection increased photoreceptor susceptibility to light-induced damage (62398).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn animal research, melatonin therapy controlled Trypanosoma cruzi proliferation by stimulating the host's immune response (62649, 62652).\nAntiviral effects\nIn animals infected with Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, administering melatonin 3 days before and 5 days after the infection reduces mortality rates compared to mice administered melatonin along with luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist (62497). This suggests that the protective effect of melatonin is mediated by interactions with melatonin receptors.\nBlood pressure effects\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of melatonin on blood pressure. In animals and humans, research has shown both increases and decreases in blood pressure (1724, 8272, 9714, 62137, 62141, 62165, 62168, 62187, 62196, 62411)(62432, 62513, 62551, 62766, 62795, 62826, 62849, 63010)(63042, 63082, 106299). Some research shows that melatonin has mixed effects depending on the time of day, with decreases at night (62359, 62416, 62441, 62681). However, other research shows that melatonin does not alter blood pressure in animals or humans (62630, 62796). Potential mechanisms for antihypertensive effects have been suggested. Melatonin possibly acts via direct effects on the hypothalamus, through antioxidant activity, by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system and decreasing norepinephrine levels while activating the parasympathetic nervous system, by a direct calcium channel blocking effect, by relaxing smooth muscle in the aorta wall, and by increasing cardiac vagal tone (8272, 62226). Other evidence suggests that melatonin lowers blood pressure via GABA(A) receptors (62513), reduces oxidative load, restores the nitric oxide pathway, and enhances cyclic guanosine monophosphate production in the endothelium (8272, 62226, 62713, 108947). Melatonin also appears to attenuate reflex sympathetic increases in response to orthostatic stress (62324).\nBone effects\nIn laboratory research, melatonin impaired osteoclast activity and bone resorption through free radical-scavenging and antioxidant methods and promoted osteoblast differentiation (3265, 62242, 62271). However, in human research, melatonin lacked effects on N-terminal telopeptide (NTX) or osteocalcin (OC), although the NTX:OC ratio in the melatonin group was reduced (62840). Also, the effects on bone density are mixed (62840, 116925).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that serum melatonin levels at nighttime are more than five times lower in patients with coronary heart disease than healthy controls (62941). In addition, following primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, low levels of platelet melatonin were found to be associated with angiographic no-reflow (62790).\n\nPotential cardioprotective effects of melatonin have been shown in both human and animal research. In humans, the inclusion of melatonin in the combined treatment of cardiovascular disease resulted in anti-ischemic and antianginal effects (62766). Also, melatonin resulted in decreased renal blood flow velocity and conductance, as well as increased forearm blood flow and vascular conductance (62796). Melatonin also increased peripheral blood flow, as measured by distal to proximal skin temperature gradient and finger pulse volume (62355). In animals, fatty streaks were inhibited by melatonin (62237). In models of experimental ischemia-reperfusion, melatonin reduced damage to tissues and limited cardiac pathophysiology (62446).\n\nThe potential mechanisms of action have been investigated. Melatonin may act directly on the cardiovascular system rather than modulating cardiac autonomic activity (62344). Relaxation of precontracted rat aorta and reduction of contractile response to alpha-adrenergic but not beta-adrenergic agonists have been observed (62432). However, in contrast to these potential benefits, in animals, melatonin increased the size of atherosclerotic lesions when provided in addition to an atherogenic diet (62230).\nChemoprotective effects\nIn animal research, melatonin reduced the toxic effects of doxorubicin; malondialdehyde levels were reduced compared to animals given doxorubicin alone (88298).\nCoagulation effects\nThere are isolated case reports of minor bleeding and decreased prothrombin activity in people taking melatonin with warfarin (Coumadin) (63067). Also, in human research, melatonin lowered plasma levels of procoagulant factors (62481). However, in animals, melatonin enhanced platelet responsiveness (62537). Also, it is thought that melatonin plays a role in mediating the influence of the psychoendocrine system and of lighting conditions on hematopoiesis. This is because melatonin regulates hematopoietic cell growth by influencing apoptosis-related mechanisms (1695). Increased platelet counts after melatonin use have been observed in patients with decreased platelets due to cancer therapies (1694, 1696, 2565, 7255, 62867, 63016, 63068). Stimulation of platelet production (thrombopoiesis) has been suggested but not clearly demonstrated. Cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) treated with melatonin have been reported (62260, 62289).\nCognitive effects\nAlthough vigilance, reaction time, and tasks in humans undergo circadian variations, they do not seem to correlate with endogenous melatonin levels (1078, 62981, 63057). Exogenous melatonin may cause decrements in performance, including a slowing of choice-reaction time (62175, 62919) or learning (62891). Some studies have failed to confirm a decrement in performance (62332, 62356, 63080), including a study of high-dose melatonin (50 mg) in elderly persons (mean age: 84.5 years) (63085). Animal research suggests a possible role of the GABAergic system (62215).\n\nChronic benzodiazepine use leads to decreased levels of melatonin. Supplementation with melatonin is therefore thought to improve the melatonin imbalance and improve sleep quality, especially withdrawal insomnia when benzodiazepines are discontinued (96323). Due to its antioxidant, inflammatory effects, and its modulatory effects on stress and cortisol secretion, there is interest in using melatonin for reversal of cognitive dysfunction that occurs during benzodiazepine withdrawal. However, current clinical research does not support melatonin for this use (96322).\nDental effects\nIn human research, salivary and gingival crevicular fluid melatonin levels were lower in individuals with periodontal disease (62737). The effect of supplementary melatonin on symptoms of periodontal disease is not clear.\nDermatologic effects\nDermatologic use of melatonin has been proposed because of its immunomodulatory and antioxidant abilities. Study findings indicate that melatonin may accumulate in the stratum corneum (1768). In human research, free radical scavenging was suggested as a possible mechanism of action in the protection against UV-induced erythema (1769).\nEndocrine effects\nIn clinical and laboratory studies, melatonin has been reported as producing varying hormonal effects. Such reports include changes in levels of cortisol in some, but not all, studies (62346, 62350, 62720, 62755, 62975, 62987, 63044), progesterone (769, 62369, 62685, 62812, 62987), estradiol (769), thyroid hormone (T4 and T3) (2425, 62225, 62507), testosterone (62244, 62507), growth hormone (1076, 1741, 1777, 1779, 62884, 62913, 62922), prolactin (62182, 62411, 62883, 62922, 62978, 63044, 63072), oxytocin and vasopressin (1779, 62680, 62719, 63017, 63050), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (62350), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (62383), and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (62697).\n\nMelatonin also appears to affect levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) (1741, 62133, 62136, 62515, 62863, 62936, 62938, 62989). However, the LH response to melatonin was found to be distorted in patients with menstrual abnormalities (62608, 62871), was absent in postmenopausal adults (62918, 62943), and was not observed in males (62773, 62876, 62925), in whom only a decrease in basal luteinizing hormone level was noted (1741, 62133, 62136).\n\nIn humans, although melatonin did not change basal oxytocin secretion, the oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was reduced (63052). Enhanced growth hormone levels may be mediated via the serotonin pathway (62442, 62911, 62912) or through naloxone-sensitive opioid-mediation (62888, 63053); however, this effect has not been confirmed in other studies (62898, 62927).\n\nUnder stimulus situations and in combination with estradiol treatment, melatonin reduced peak values of norepinephrine and increased epinephrine levels in humans in some, but not all, studies (9704, 62152, 62509, 63010). In human research, during a heavy-resistance exercise session, melatonin increased the area under the curve of growth hormone (62424). It has been proposed that administering melatonin to aging females may lead to a recovery of pituitary and thyroid function (2425, 11806). Although it has been suggested that melatonin may modulate hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function and affect body temperature (62383), in healthy young men, melatonin lacked an effect on suppressing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system activity (62411). Research has suggested that melatonin may mimic the effect of drugs that act through the estrogen receptor interfering with the effects of endogenous estrogens, as well as those that interfere with the synthesis of estrogens by inhibiting the enzymes controlling the interconversion from their androgenic precursors (62395).\n\nSome evidence suggests that melatonin peak time (acrophase) is advanced in postmenopausal adults when compared with premenopausal adults (89432). Some clinical evidence suggests that hormone replacement therapy does not affect serum levels or the duration of endogenous melatonin secretion, but it does appear to delay melatonin acrophase by 2.4 hours in postmenopausal adults after about 6 months of treatment (89507). Theoretically, some of the positive effects of hormone therapy in postmenopausal adults may be related to its ability to delay advanced melatonin peak time.\nExercise performance effects\nMelatonin may have beneficial effects during exercise. In human research, in combination with exercise melatonin increased the area under the curve of growth hormone (62424) and protected against the overexpression, or inhibited the expression, of inflammatory mediators (62813). Melatonin also decreased exercise-induced increases in triglyceride levels and improved antioxidant status (62839).\nGastrointestinal effects\nResearch has been conducted concerning the effects of melatonin in patients with duodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and ulcerative colitis. In patients with GERD, a melatonin-containing supplement inhibited gastric acid secretion and synthesis of nitric oxide (16011); nitric oxide affects lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, a major mechanism. Melatonin may also regulate pancreatic secretion and maintained the integrity of the pancreas (62448), affect bowel functions, reduce gut contractions induced by serotonin, and inhibit proliferation of epithelium, (62970). In animals, high doses of melatonin have been shown to inhibit motility by interacting with serotonin and CCK2 (62417). Protective effects of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract may be due to its effects on prostaglandins and cytoprotection from its free radical-scavenging activity (62193, 62267, 62325, 62349, 62477, 62478). In animal models of gastric ulcer, beneficial effects of melatonin may be due to the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases-9 and -3 (62591). Melatonin showed similar benefit in a model of NSAID-induced gastropathy by preventing activation of the mitochondrially mediated apoptosis (by mitigating oxidative stress) (62542).\nGraft effects\nIn animals, melatonin improved the survival of human-derived ovarian grafts (62832). The mechanism of action is unclear.\nHepatoprotective effects\nVarious hepatoprotective effects of melatonin have been shown in humans. In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), use of melatonin resulted in improvements in liver function (62853). In patients with steatohepatitis, melatonin decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, triglycerides, and GGTP (62787). Also, decreased transaminases have been shown following liver resection (62807).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn human and animal research, melatonin reduced cholesterol levels (62787, 62795, 62839, 63025, 110291). However, there is some evidence of increases in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels in human research (62176).\nImmune effects\nResearchers have conducted studies concerning the effects of melatonin as they relate to cachexia, chemotherapy side effects, HIV/AIDS, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and sepsis. Researchers noted increased platelet counts after melatonin use in patients with decreased platelets due to cancer chemotherapy (1694, 1696, 2565, 7255, 62464, 62867, 63016). Although not clearly demonstrated, studies have indicated possible stimulation of platelet production (thrombopoiesis). Melatonin has been reported to promote neutrophil apoptosis in patients receiving hepatectomy involving ischemia and reperfusion of the liver (62293, 62300, 62306, 62326). Preliminary clinical studies suggest that combined therapy with low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 and melatonin improved the immune status in AIDS patients with CD4 cell counts below 200/mm3, who generally do not respond to IL-2 alone. The mean number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD25- and DR-positive lymphocytes increased with the treatment. An increase in the subjects' CD4:CD8 mean ratio was noted (63002). In cancer patients who achieved disease control, melatonin induced a decrease in the number of regulatory T lymphocytes; this change was lacking in individuals with progressed disease (62783). A combination hormone therapy including melatonin was found to improve leukocyte function in ovariectomized aged rats (62567).\n\nActivation of melatonin receptors has been associated with the release of cytokines by type 1 T-helper cells (Th1), including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and IL-2, as well as novel opioid cytokines (62167). There is indirect evidence that melatonin may amplify the immunostimulatory effect of IL-2, as measured by an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and eosinophils in cancer patients (7043, 62301, 62334, 62977, 62983). In animal research, inhibition of the circadian synthesis of melatonin has been associated with reversible immunosuppression (62881) and elicited T cell autoimmunity in mice (62954, 63032).\n\nAdministration of melatonin agonists has reportedly reduced neophobia, and treatment with a melatonin antagonist during the dark period has reportedly reversed the anxiolytic-like effect of endogenous melatonin (62288). A study in rats showed that melatonin attenuated kainic acid (KA)-induced neuronal death, lipid peroxidation, and microglial activation, and the number of DNA breaks (62272). Other mechanisms through which melatonin may modulate the immune system, according to laboratory research, include the following: suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (62520); inhibition of Th1 cells (62647); stimulation of humoral activity/antibody production (62532, 62628, 62695); inhibition of NF-kappaB (62541), IKK, and JNK pathways (62485); prevention of T cell apoptosis (62742); and stimulation of mononuclear cell production (62687).\nNeurologic effects\nIt has also been proposed that melatonin may reduce the amount of neurologic damage patients experience after stroke, due to its antioxidant properties (10671, 32513, 62203, 62219, 62236, 62253, 62273, 62322). Melatonin has also been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease, having been shown in laboratory study to attenuate amyloid-beta-induced phosphorylation of tau-protein and prevent GSK-3beta activation and neuroinflammation (62732), and mitigate amyloid-beta-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction (62712) and amyloid-beta load (62659). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that melatonin may inhibit the biochemical processes involved with the development of myeloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease; however, the clinical significance is unclear (9710). Possible neuroprotective mechanisms include the prevention of FGF9 downregulation (62581), the prevention of the induction of mitochondrial NO synthase (62571), or the inhibition of 6-hydroxydopamine production (62663). Other animal research has indicated that melatonin preserved hippocampal cytochrome oxidase and sirtuin-1 expression following sleep deprivation (62623). According to a review, melatonin mechanisms related to a reduction in headache pathophysiology include its anti-inflammatory effect, toxic free radical scavenging, reduction of proinflammatory cytokine upregulation, nitric oxide synthase activity and dopamine release inhibition, membrane stabilization, GABA and opioid analgesia potentiation, glutamate neurotoxicity protection, neurovascular regulation, 5-HT modulation, and its similarity in chemical structure to indomethacin (62425).\n\nHowever, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, melatonin was found to potentiate neurodegeneration (62637). Also, although a number of preliminary animal studies have also suggested that melatonin may aid in recovery from or mitigate spinal cord injury (62327, 62522, 62751), not all findings have been positive (62498).\nOpioid tolerance effects\nIn animals, researchers have concluded that melatonin acutely reversed and prevented tolerance to and dependence on morphine (62126, 62276), and reduced the incidence of naloxone-induced withdrawal (62126); however, the exact mechanism is not well understood.\nOptic/ocular effects\nIn human research, melatonin stabilized vision in patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration (62419) and decreased intraocular pressure in the eye (62551, 62889, 62961). However, information in available reviews suggests that high doses of melatonin may increase intraocular pressure and the risk of glaucoma, age-related maculopathy, and myopia (63036), as well as retinal damage (63003).\nPsychiatric effects\nIn patients with schizophrenia, melatonin lacked effects on P50 suppression, suggesting a lack of effect on sensory gating in these patients (62846). However, increases in the P50 ratio occurred in some individuals with high baseline P50 suppression.\nRadioprotective effects\nAnimal and in vitro research has shown that melatonin possesses a protective effect against damage caused by ionizing radiation (62504, 62577, 62609, 62661, 62662, 62696, 62734). The specific mechanisms may involve downregulation of apoptotic pathways via control of oxidative load (62511). Furthermore, there is interest in whether melatonin might be protective against medical imaging radiation. One in vitro study suggests that X-ray radiation of 100 mGy seems to result in fewer double-stranded DNA breaks in blood samples taken from volunteers after melatonin ingestion when compared with blood samples taken before melatonin ingestion (104999). However, a clinical study in females with hyperthyroidism receiving 10-20 mCi iodine-131 shows that taking melatonin 300 mg prior to radioiodine therapy has no effect on chromosomal damage when compared with placebo (107810).\nReproductive effects\nDue to its antioxidant potential and role in determining sexual status in certain mammals, melatonin has been suggested as a means of improving reproductive success in a variety of conditions (62573). In animals, exposure to exogenous melatonin increased sperm motility, ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, total sperm output, total function sperm fraction, and blood testosterone concentration, and decreased means of reaction time, dead sperm, abnormal sperm, and blood triiodothyronine concentration (62507, 62689) and regulate follicular development and oocyte competence (62604, 62612).\n\nAlso, melatonin implants have been shown to improve semen characteristics (62686). Additional veterinary research has indicated that melatonin may increase reproductive success (62486, 62502, 62589) or activity, depending on the dose (6497, 62627) and improve the viability of embryos produced with in vitro fertilization (62488, 62490, 62549, 62668, 62731). There is preliminary evidence that very high melatonin doses plus norethisterone can have additive or synergistic effects on inhibiting ovarian function and possibly act as a contraceptive (769). In vitro, melatonin has been shown to decrease kisspeptin gene expression, while increasing that of RFRP-3 in cell lines from rat hypothalamus (62576). In other research, melatonin lacked an effect on luteal blood flow or function in humans (62528). In a rat model of endometriosis, melatonin was shown to induce regression of endometriotic foci (62682). Other reproductive applications of melatonin include the suppression of estrus (in cats) (62594), induction of estrus (in goats) (62588), and inhibition of gonad function (in fish) (62585).\nSleep effects\nMelatonin, administered in the day or night in doses beyond the physiological range, appears to elicit a hypnotic effect. Various studies have been conducted in humans. For example, exogenous melatonin exerted hypnotic effects primarily when circulating levels of endogenous melatonin were low (1758) and even very low doses may cause sleep when ingested before endogenous melatonin onset (1078, 1753, 1756, 62947, 62997), although some studies have failed to confirm this finding (62895). Functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests melatonin may play a role in priming sleep-associated brain activation patterns in anticipation of sleep (62420). Also, melatonin has been shown to decrease the amount of anesthesia required during surgery (62233, 62430, 62443, 62444) and potentiate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepines, and improve quality of sleep in combination with benzodiazepines (62964). Melatonin may interact directly with the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ion channel as suggested in both human and animal research (62183, 62269), but not with the benzodiazepine receptor as suggested in human research (63005).\n\nRandomized clinical trials have demonstrated some effect of melatonin on circadian rhythm entraining (62207, 62377, 62409). Endogenous circadian rhythmicity influences autonomic control of heart rate, and the timing of these endogenous rhythms may be altered by extended sleep/rest episodes and associated changes in the photoperiod, as well as by melatonin treatment (62461), with no evidence of changes in the duration of endogenous melatonin secretion or pituitary or gonadal hormones (62335). In visually impaired individuals, disturbances of sleep and sleep-related neuroendocrine patterns may be caused by the absence of light cues as the lack of light signal in blind persons leads to various unusual free-running melatonin secretory patterns (62367, 62923, 62929). Also, people who suffer from an insufficient amount of environmental light often have decreased endogenous melatonin secretion (8247). In individuals who are completely blind, a single administration of a pharmacological dose of melatonin improved sleep function by synchronizing the inhibition of pituitary-adrenal activity with central nervous sleep processes (62350). Disturbances in the circadian rhythm of melatonin (and declines in nighttime melatonin) have been associated with aging (1773, 1775, 1781, 62134, 62116, 62170, 62900, 63046). In human research, exogenous melatonin is able to shift circadian rhythms, as well as endogenous melatonin secretion and core body temperature (62418, 62945, 63001, 63023). However, light appears to be a stronger regulator of circadian rhythm than melatonin itself (8274, 62960, 62986, 62999, 63008, 63015, 63018, 63033). The time of administration of melatonin is of critical importance, since it may cause both phase delay and phase advance. In human research it was determined that for phase delay, melatonin should be administered in the early morning; however, for phase advance, melatonin should be administered 1-2 hours before 9 p.m. (8274).\n\nClinically, melatonin is used in many disease states thought to have low levels of melatonin such as traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease (62847, 96317, 96319, 96320). Decreased membrane fluidity is thought to play a role in the pathogenies of Alzheimer's disease. Stress and rapid eye movement contribute to neuronal rigidity. Melatonin has been added to other ingredients to help promote sleep and improve cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (62847). Additionally, in patients with depression, the circadian rhythm is altered. Patients with depression often have insomnia and early-morning awakening. It has been hypothesized that low melatonin secretion is a marker of depression, and melatonin may improve these symptoms, although the majority of clinical research does not support melatonin for this use (96326).\n\nLow-dose melatonin has been noted to be more effective entraining blind people with a free-running melatonin secretory pattern due to the potential of excess hormone discharging into the wrong zone of the phase-response curve (62232). Free-running patterns are also observed after pineal gland damage (62952) or under special working regimens (62901, 62955). The nocturnal onset of melatonin secretion strongly correlates with a steep rise in sleep propensity and precedes it by approximately two hours (63047). The specific events taking place during this interval currently remain obscure. It is possible that melatonin does not actively induce sleep but switches off a wakefulness-generated mechanism that opposes a sleep-inducing mechanism (63047), the alerting process being dependent on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (63039).While measuring endogenous melatonin, some authors have not found a link between melatonin secretion and the sleep-waking cycle in humans (62899). It has been suggested by some that natural sleep is largely determined by a functioning circadian system without melatonin involvement (62886, 62949, 63045, 63046).\nThermoregulating effects\nThe central thermoregulatory centers, including the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus, are likely to be involved with the regulation of core temperature following melatonin administration (1132). In human research, hypothermic effects of melatonin have been reported with doses from 15mg (1757, 62418, 63007) and ingestion of melatonin 1.6 mg was reported to result in approximately 0.4 ºC decrease of body temperature in humans (62418, 62945, 63001, 63023). The hypothermic effects may be mediated by GABA receptor activity (63063). Melatonin may also influence chloride flux or other intracellular actions via a different mechanism that is not well understood (63005). Melatonin did not appear to exert hypothermic effects by central benzodiazepine receptors (63005). Melatonin appeared to increase heat loss and decrease heat production when taken during the day (63063). A parallel relationship was found between rectal core body temperature and the decline in sleep onset latency following melatonin administration (63063).\nToxicity protective effects\nA number of laboratory studies have established melatonin's ability to prevent or mitigate damage from a number of chemical sources, including (but not limited to) methamphetamines (62563, 62717), organophosphorus compounds (62493, 62494, 62664), alcohol (62636, 62675), nicotine (62716), beta-cyfluthrin (62700), and benzo(a)pyrene (62694).\nVestibular effects\nIn human research, melatonin attenuated the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (vestibulosympathetic reflex) response to baroreceptor unloading, while lacking effects on the vestibulocollic reflexes (62779). In human research, melatonin positively benefitted balance (1776).\nWeight loss effects\nMelatonin may inhibit preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. It may also increase the metabolic rate and energy expenditure by converting white adipose tissue to brown (96316)."

            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCerebrovascular disease. Preliminary clinical research in small groups of patients with cerebrovascular disease shows that taking mesoglycan 96-100 mg daily orally for 6 months seems to reduce ischemic events, improve quality of life, and provide subjective improvement when compared with baseline (6635, 6637, 6639). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. There is also some preliminary evidence that mesoglycan might be comparable to standard antiplatelet drug therapy (6639).\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). The majority of preliminary clinical research shows that mesoglycan improves walking distance in patients with PAD, although it may not be as effective as other therapies. Alternating intravenous and oral mesoglycan seems to improve walking distance when compared with baseline in patients with intermittent claudication due to PAD (6629). Also, injecting mesoglycan 30 mg intramuscularly for 3 weeks then taking oral mesoglycan 100 mg daily for 20 weeks appears to improve clinical response and walking distance in patients with PAD when compared with placebo (31635). Taking mesoglycan 100 mg daily orally for a total of 120 days increases walking distance by approximately 39% when compared with baseline (97779). However, taking oral mesoglycan 48 mg daily for 6 months is less effective at improving pain-free walking distance and total walking distance than oral defibrotide 800 mg daily in patients with intermittent claudication due to PAD (31647).\nVenous insufficiency. There is some evidence from uncontrolled trials that administering mesoglycan orally or parenterally may improve the subjective and objective symptoms associated with various venous conditions, including varicose syndromes, post-phlebitic syndromes, and thrombophlebitis, when used over a 1-3 month period (6630, 6638, 6644, 6645). Some research also shows that applying mesoglycan topically might be beneficial for treating leg ulcers in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (6627).\nVenous leg ulcers. Clinical research shows that administering a combination of intramuscular and oral mesoglycan as an adjunct to traditional chronic venous stasis ulcer therapy improves the rate of healing when compared with traditional therapy alone. At least 75% of patients taking mesoglycan were fully healed approximately 46 days earlier than patients taking traditional therapy alone (11479).\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nStroke. Clinical research in patients with acute ischemic stroke shows that adding intramuscular mesoglycan for 5 days, followed by 25 days of oral mesoglycan, to intravenous dexamethasone therapy is no more effective than dexamethasone alone (6641).\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). Clinical research shows that taking oral mesoglycan plus compression stockings following standard deep venous thrombosis (DVT) therapy is no better than placebo for preventing recurrent DVT and/or pulmonary embolism during a follow-up period ranging from 5 to 48 months (6640).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral mesoglycan 200 mg daily for 18 months might slow the progression of atherosclerosis by decreasing the rate of carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickening (6628, 31649).\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Preliminary clinical research in adults with unilateral lower limb edema due to CVI shows that taking mesoglycan 100 mg daily for one month reduces pain and swelling by approximately 43% and 63%, respectively, when compared with placebo (97778).\nCutaneous necrotizing venulitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that intramuscular mesoglycan 10 mg/kg daily for 20 days might be useful for treating cutaneous necrotizing venulitis in patients with reduced fibrinolytic activity (6634).\nDiabetic retinopathy. Preliminary clinical research in adults with diabetic retinopathy shows that taking mesoglycan 100 mg daily for 6 months reduces the occurrence of microhemorrhages, microaneurysms, and exudates, compared with no change in those taking placebo (97777).\nHypertension. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking mesoglycan 100 mg daily orally for a total of 120 days reduces systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg when compared to baseline in patients with hypertension (97779). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nHypertriglyceridemia. Preliminary clinical research in a small group of patients shows that taking mesoglycan 96 mg daily reduces total triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels when compared to baseline in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (6646).The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nMetabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in a small group of patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking mesoglycan 50 mg twice daily for 90 days improves vascular function, as measured by brachial flow-mediated dilation and arterial stiffness, when compared with placebo (103265).\nPostoperative pain. Preliminary, prospective clinical research in a small group of patients undergoing open excisional diathermy hemorrhoidectomy shows that intramuscular mesoglycan (Prisma, Mediolanum Farmaceutici) 60 mg daily for 5 days postoperatively, then 50 mg orally twice daily for 30 days, reduces pain after rectal examination, but not spontaneous pain or pain after defecation, and shortens the time to full resumption of normal daily activities, when compared with ketorolac 10 mg orally every 4-6 hours for 5 days (103263). A retrospective, observational study in a larger group of patients undergoing the same surgery shows that giving the same mesoglycan regimen in conjunction with the ketorolac regimen reduces pain on postoperative day 1 and after 1, 3, and 6 weeks of follow-up when compared with the ketorolac regimen alone. The addition of mesoglycan also reduces the incidence of postoperative rectal thromboses and the time to recovery of normal activities, but does not reduce postoperative bleeding or time to wound healing, when compared with ketorolac alone (109651).\nTinnitus. Observational research in patients with tinnitus has found that taking mesoglycan 50 mg daily for 90 days is associated with an improvement in tinnitus when compared to baseline (103264). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group .\nVertigo. Observational research in patients with vertigo has found that taking mesoglycan 50 mg daily for 90 days is associated with an improvement in vertigo symptoms when compared to baseline (103264).

GAGs, also called mucopolysaccharides, are amino hexose polysaccharides contained in mucoproteins, glycoproteins, and blood group substances. GAGs are a heparinoid (non-heparin) byproduct of heparin extraction from bovine lung and aortic tissue and porcine intestinal mucosa (15). Mesoglycan specifically is composed of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, with smaller concentrations of chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and related hexosaminoglycans (6614). The concentrations of these substances can vary depending on the origin of the product.\nCirculatory effects\nMesoglycan seems to have numerous pharmacological effects on the vascular system. Mesoglycan exhibits profibrinolytic activity without influencing hemagglutination in humans after oral administration (6631, 6642). It seems to also decrease plasma fibrinogen concentrations without affecting prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or antithrombin III (6633). Mesoglycan might restore normal fibrinolysis in patients with reduced cutaneous fibrinolytic activity (6634). However, it has been shown to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (6629). Mesoglycan seems to reduce pericapillary connective tissue edema, and capillary and venule dilation, in patients with primary venous insufficiency (6630). It also improves arterial wall elasticity, transcutaneous oxygen perfusion, and blood flow (6643, 6644). Mesoglycan reduces total triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein concentrations and increases lipoprotein lipase activity in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (6646). In patients recovering from a cerebral ischemic episode, mesoglycan reduces total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and increases HDL cholesterol concentrations (6633)."

It is unclear if high dietary intake of methionine reduces the risk of breast cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that higher dietary intake of methionine is associated with a 6% lower risk of breast cancer, especially for postmenopausal adults, when compared with lower intake. Increasing dietary intake of methionine by 1 gram daily may be associated with a 4% reduction in the risk of breast cancer. These results appear to be more prominent in postmenopausal adults when compared with premenopausal adults; however, this could have been by chance due to the small number of studies that assessed premenopausal adults (94093). A more recent meta-analysis, including 4 additional observational studies, suggests that there is no significant association between methionine intake and breast cancer risk. This finding is largely influenced by inclusion of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cohort study, which analyzed data from over 300,000 subjects and found no relationship between methionine intake and breast cancer risk (111416).\nless\nCisplatin-associated ototoxicity. It is unclear if oral D-methionine prevents cisplatin-associated ototoxicity.\nA small clinical study in adults with cancer receiving cisplatin shows that taking D-methionine 100 mg/kg one hour prior to chemotherapy for up to 5 cycles prevents shifts in the hearing threshold at all four tested frequencies, compared with shifts occurring at three of the four tested frequencies in those receiving placebo (108039). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison between groups.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if high dietary intake of methionine reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that higher dietary intake of methionine is associated with an 11% lower risk of colorectal cancer, a 23% lower risk of colon cancer, and a 12% lower risk of rectal cancer, when compared with lower intake of methionine. Increasing dietary intake of methionine by 1 gram daily is associated with a 11% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer. Subgroup analyses have shown a significant inverse relationship between risk of colorectal cancer and dietary methionine intake in patients followed for at least 13.3 years, in Western populations, and in males (94094).\n\nThere is some evidence that high dietary intake of methionine and folate might have a synergistic effect in decreasing the risk of colon cancer, especially in those with a family history of colon cancer and in those who consume large amounts of alcohol (9325, 9326).\nless\nGenital herpes. Oral L-methionine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with genital warts caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) shows that taking acyclovir 200 mg five times daily for 5 days followed by 4 capsules of a combination product providing a total daily dose of L-methionine 200 mg, coenzyme Q10 50 mg, vitamin E 50 mg, and selenium 50 mcg for 90 days increases the rate of skin reepithelization by approximately 2 days and decreases the incidence of relapse when compared with acyclovir alone. Patients receiving combination therapy had a relapse rate of 13%, compared with a rate of 43% with acyclovir alone (94091).\nless\nHerpes zoster (shingles). Oral L-methionine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with herpes zoster shows that taking acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for 10 days followed by 4 capsules of a combination product providing a total daily dose of L-methionine 200 mg, coenzyme Q10 50 mg, vitamin E 50 mg, and selenium 50 mcg for 90 days increases the rate of skin reepithelization by approximately 2 days, decreases the incidence of relapse, and decreases postherpetic neuralgia pain when compared with acyclovir alone. Patients receiving combination therapy had a relapse rate of 7%, compared with a rate of 44% with acyclovir alone (94091).\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if oral methionine is beneficial for the treatment of HPV lesions or for reducing the incidence of relapse.\nA clinical study in patients aged 14 years or older with cutaneous warts caused by HPV shows that receiving conventional therapy in combination with one capsule of a product containing methionine, echinacea, inulin, taurine, vitamin A, vitamin C, coenzyme Q10, vitamin B3, zinc gluconate, and probiotics (Immuno Skin Plus tablets, Morgan Pharma S.r.l) daily for 20 days each month for 4 months reduces the number of warts at 6 months by about 5, with complete remission achieved in 86% of patients. The group receiving conventional therapy alone had a reduction in the number of warts by about 3, with complete remission achieved in 55% of patients. Conventional therapy consisted of either liquid nitrogen cryotherapy or topical therapy with salicylic acid 15% and lactic acid 15%. These findings are limited by the fact that patients in the combination therapy group had more warts at baseline when compared with those receiving conventional therapy alone (94092).\n\nAnother small clinical study in patients with skin warts caused by HPV shows that cryotherapy followed by taking 4 capsules of a product containing a total dose of L-methionine 200 mg, coenzyme Q10 50 mg, vitamin E 50 mg, and selenium 50 mcg daily for 180 days increases the rate of complete recovery and decreases the incidence of relapse when compared with cryotherapy followed by placebo. At 180 days, 56% of patients in the active group experienced complete recovery, compared with 44% in the placebo group, and 30% of patients in the active group experienced a relapse, compared with 41% in the placebo group (94091). It is unclear if these effects are due to methionine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral L-methionine is beneficial for reducing hot flashes.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults experiencing at least 5 hot flashes daily for the prior two months shows that taking L-methionine 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks, then 2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks, does not improve hot flashes when compared with placebo (94090).\nless\nPancreatitis. Oral methionine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of eight randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies in patients with chronic or recurrent acute pancreatitis shows that taking a combination of methionine, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene reduces pain when compared with placebo. However, when the two nonrandomized studies were excluded, the significant reduction in pain was lost. Daily doses of individual components studied included methionine 1.6-2.88 grams, selenium 300-600 mcg, vitamin E 188-280 mg, vitamin C 540-720 mg, and beta-carotene 12-54 mg. The study durations ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months (94095). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there has been interest in using oral methionine for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of methionine for this purpose.\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using oral methionine for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of methionine for this purpose.\nUrinary tract infections (UTI). Oral methionine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone is unclear.\nA low-quality observational study in patients with symptomatic UTI and culture-confirmed bacteriuria during pregnancy has found that taking a specific combination of methionine 800 mg, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract 200 mg, and Boswellia serrata 200 mg (Acidif Plus, Biohealth S.r.l) daily for one week increases the rate of negative urine cultures to 70% and symptom resolution to 63%, compared with 43% and 46%, respectively, in patients who increased fluid intake but did not take the combination product (97263). The validity of these findings is limited by the fact that the study groups were not comparable at baseline.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate methionine for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMethionine is an essential amino acid. It plays a role in many cellular functions. It is used for protein synthesis and methylation of DNA, RNA, and other molecules (9336, 9342).\nAnticancer effects\nA higher intake of methionine was significantly associated with a lower risk of pancreatic, colorectal, and breast cancer (63127, 94093, 94094). In cancer, inflammation promotes tumor growth via gene mutations and cell proliferation (94094). Methionine is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which decreases inflammation in animals and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells in laboratory research (94094). Methionine may help to protect DNA from cancer via methylation. Methionine is a one-carbon nutrient, exhibiting one-carbon metabolism, which is vital for DNA synthesis and repair, as well as synthesis of protein and other amino acids. Methionine deficiency could lead to issues with DNA repair, and ultimately, cancer (94093, 94094). Methionine might also act synergistically with folate to decrease the risk of colon cancer (9325, 9326). While there is some evidence that a high dietary intake of methionine with salt and nitrates might increase the risk of gastric cancer (2409), a large observational study that adjusted for sodium intake has found no association between dietary intake of methionine and gastric cancer (108041).\n\nRates of methylation are much higher in tumor than in normal tissue (9342). Most tumors are dependent on exogenous, preformed methionine for growth (9341). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests restriction of dietary methionine in cancer patients might inhibit tumor growth and improve cancer treatment outcomes (9341, 9342). Furthermore, many human cancer cell lines and primary tumors have absolute requirements for methionine, whereas normal cells are relatively resistant to exogenous methionine restriction (63125). The effect of methionine restriction on tumors has been evaluated in clinical trials, animal models, and in vitro studies. In a pilot Phase I clinical trial involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, the intravenous infusion of methioninase was found to safely and effectively deplete methionine without signs of side effects (63134). Dietary restriction of methionine was also found to be safe and feasible in a Phase I clinical trial involving patients with advanced cancer (9342). Preliminary data from the study showed that the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was reduced 25% in a patient with prostate cancer after the diet had been followed for 12 weeks. In another patient (with renal cell cancer), an objective radiographic response occurred (9342). It is not clear whether either patient had received anticancer treatment. Because of potential toxicity and quality-of-life problems, prolonged methionine restriction with diet or with methioninase may not be suitable (63125).\n\nIn cultures of AH109A cells (hepatoma), a D-methionine-supplemented medium inhibited cell growth to an extent similar to that manifested in a methionine-free medium (63111). In another in vitro study, the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) increased dramatically in response to methionine restriction, suggesting that JNK1 may play a critical role in signaling cancer cells to undergo apoptosis in response to methionine restriction (63120).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere is interest in using methionine for pain secondary to pancreatitis. In patients with chronic pancreatitis, levels of antioxidants are depleted, and oxidative stress is present. This is present both in circulation and within the pancreas itself. Oxidative stress results in malfunctioning of the transsulfuration pathway within the pancreas. Methionine is required for maintenance of this pathway and is depleted secondary to oxidative stress. The combination of low levels of methionine in addition to oxidative stress ultimately leads to inflammation within the pancreas, pain, and fibrosis. Supplementation with methionine is thought to improve the pathway and ameliorate inflammation and pain (94095).\n\nPatients with alcohol-induced liver disease often exhibit hypermethioninemia, which is thought to be caused by decreased metabolism of methionine to SAMe. With low levels of glutathione, the liver is at an increased risk of damage from free radicals (9336, 9338). Toxic levels of methionine can be corrected with glycine. Glycine seems to enhance the degradation of methionine through transsulfuration by acting as a receptor for methyl groups. Excessive methionine competes for glycine and limits the availability of glycine for other metabolic interactions, such as the synthesis of glutathione (2415).\n\nMethionine has also been studied for its effects on hearing. In an animal model, a rescue dose of D-methionine, administered after impulse or steady-state noise exposure, has no protective effect on temporary hearing threshold shifts, but alters some serum and cochlear antioxidant levels (108040).\nAntiviral effects\nOxidative stress is thought to play a role in viral skin infections. Deficiencies in antioxidants also play a role in pathogenesis. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are produced in infected cells, as well as secreted from phagocytes. This damages viral cells, allowing the immune system to clear the cells via the lymphatic system. However, inflammation caused by overproduction of ROS/RNS can damage the surrounding healthy tissue. There is interest in using supplements with antioxidant properties, including methionine, to help control the ROS/RNS system and limit damage to the surrounding healthy tissue (94091).\n\nLaboratory research shows that in granulocytes from healthy patients, L-methionine alone exhibits prooxidant effects via stimulation of ROS/RNS production. When combined with coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and selenium, the combination inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species overall. This suggests a small effect on stimulation of granulocytes with overall antioxidant properties (94091).\nEndocrine effects\nMany amino acids are known to stimulate growth hormone. There is preliminary evidence that methionine also potentiates the secretion of basal growth hormone and growth hormone induced by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) (2412).\nHepatic effects\nIn acetaminophen poisoning, methionine seems to prevent liver damage and necrosis by promoting glutathione synthesis. The toxic metabolite of acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-benzquinoneimine) will then bind to glutathione instead of liver cells (9340).\nHormonal effects\nThere is interest in using methionine for post-menopausal symptoms, particularly hot flashes. Similar to gabapentin, L-methionine appears to have high affinity for the alpha-2-delta subunit of calcium channels. Its interaction with this site leads to decreases in calcium currents, which is thought to help ameliorate hot flashes (94090).\nNutrient effects\nDietary methionine usually has no effect on homocysteine levels. Levels can increase and possibly lead to hyperhomocysteinemia if enzymes that metabolize homocysteine are defective and/or there is a deficiency in folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 (9343). Hyperhomocysteinemia might cause endothelial damage and increase the risk for vascular disease (2410, 2411). Hyperhomocysteinemia that is unresponsive to vitamin supplementation sometimes responds to dietary restriction of methionine (9345)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCitrus foods are a predominant source of methoxylated flavones. Orange juice contains 2-7 ppm of the methoxylated flavones sinensetin, tangeretin, nobiletin, and heptamethoxylated flavone (12079). Methoxylated flavones might be more stable than some other flavonoids due to the methylation of the phenolic groups, which may help to resist oxidative breakdown (12078).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that the methoxylated flavone nobiletin has anti-inflammatory effects, with an estimated potency of about 68% relative to hydrocortisone (12081). Additional in vitro research shows that methoxylated flavones reduce the production of nitric oxide in inflamed cells. Although nitric oxide typically exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, it can become pro-inflammatory when overproduced. Nobiletin and 3,4,5,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone demonstrated the most potent inhibition of nitric oxide overproduction (100674).\nAnticancer effects\nThe chemical structure and/or degree of methoxylation are thought to play a role in the activity of the various methoxylated flavones (94023, 94025). In vitro research shows that methoxylated flavones can induce apoptosis in tumor cells (12078, 94023, 94025, 100674). The methyoxylated flavones 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF), and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF) in addition to commercially available 5-methoxyflavone (5-MF) and 2'-methoxyflavone (2'-MF) showed cytotoxicity toward two different leukemia cell lines. Additionally, each of the flavones induced apoptosis in one of the two cell lines (94024). In another in vitro study, adding the methoxylated flavone tangeretin to conventional therapy with paclitaxel increased apoptosis and caused an accumulation of cells arrested in the G2/M-phase (94025). In another in vitro study, tangeretin induced apoptosis of HL-60 leukemia cells (12078). Nobiletin and tangeretin have demonstrated the ability to induce their own metabolism in breast cancer cells via induction of CYP1 enzyme expression. This produces metabolites with greater antiproliferative and apoptotic activity than the parent compounds (100677).\n\nMethoxylated flavones also affect drug efflux transporters. In vitro, treatment with tangeretin increased the sensitivity of a paclitaxel resistant cell line, decreased the IC50 of paclitaxel, and decreased cell colony formation. Tangeretin also decreased the IC50 of docetaxel and daunorubicin, leading to an enhancement of the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents. Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) leads to multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. It is thought that tangeretin can sensitize cells that overexpress the P-glycoprotein ABCB1. Tangeretin increases the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs, likely by inhibiting ABCB1 efflux activity. In order for the ABC transporters to function, ATP hydrolysis must occur. Tangeretin was shown to increase the ABCB1 ATPase activity, as well as inhibit verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Thus, it is possible tangeretin may act as a substrate of ABCB1 and also as an inhibitor (94025).\n\nPolymethoxylated flavones have also been shown to inhibit proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, with inhibition similar to prednisolone. The flavones also showed suppressive effects against reactive oxygen species (94023).\n\nMethoxylated flavones have also been shown to have in vitro activity against other human cancer cell lines including melanoma, prostate, colon, and lung cancer cells (12084). Additionally, nobiletin and tangeretin seem to induce liver metabolism and detoxification of some hydrocarbon carcinogens and inhibit growth of squamous cell carcinoma and gliosarcoma cells in culture (12078).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that methoxylated flavones have antioxidant capabilities and seem to decrease lipid peroxidation (12078).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that tetramethoxyflavones may have antiviral activity against rhinovirus (12081).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using methoxylated flavones for cardiovascular disease. In vitro and animal studies show that methoxylated flavones decrease platelet aggregation and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (12079, 12080, 12082, 12083). The antiplatelet effects of the methoxylated flavones seem to be greater than the flavonoids quercetin, rutin or hesperidin. The methoxylated flavone sinensetin has the greatest antiplatelet effect and tangeretin the least. Nobiletin and heptamethoxyflavone fall in between the two (12079, 12082). These effects on platelet adhesion could theoretically play a role in prevention cardiovascular disease. There is also in vitro evidence that nobiletin can prevent experimentally induced thrombosis to a greater extent than heparin (12081).\nImmunologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that methoxylated flavones may alter immune function. Tangeretin seems to reduce expression of class II histocompatibility antigens in human blood monocytes. However, neither tangeretin nor nobiletin seem to decrease antigen-induced histamine release (12078). Other in vitro research shows that heptamethoxyflavones can inhibit T cell growth in spleen cells through inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity and an increase in cyclic AMP concentrations (100678).\nLipid effects\nDietary consumption of methoxylated flavones might reduce lipid levels. In animal models of hyperlipidemia, a diet consisting of 1% tangeretin or 1% tangeretin plus nobiletin, significantly reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, a diet consisting of a smaller concentration of these methoxylated flavones, 0.25%, does not seem to significantly reduce cholesterol levels (12112). In vitro research shows that methoxylated flavones strongly inhibit sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, which play a role in the regulation of lipogenesis and lipid homeostasis (100674).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in the use of methoxylated flavones for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease. In vitro research shows that some, but not all, methoxylated flavones inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (100675).\nPigment effects\nThere is interest in using methoxylated flavones to alter skin pigment. It is hypothesized that melanin production is altered by changes in melanosomal pH. In vitro research shows that polymethoxylated flavones suppress melanin production in melanocytes by decreasing pH and causing the degradation of tyrosinase (100679)."

Extravasation has occurred following intravenous infusion of methylene blue. In one case, blistering and skin irritation occurred (116362, 116458). Intraparenchymally, redness, broken blood vessels, and skin necrosis have been reported rarely (116392). Blue skin color has occurred rarely when methylene blue is given for chromopertubation during laparoscopy (116375).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, gastrointestinal adverse effects are common, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal discoloration, nausea, and vomiting (116388, 116408, 116409, 116414, 116417, 116419, 116430, 116432, 116444). Blue feces, saliva, and vomitus have also occurred rarely when methylene blue is given for chromopertubation during laparoscopy (116375). When used intravenously, the most common adverse events include diarrhea and nausea. Other adverse effects include lower abdominal pain, dry mouth, flatulence, burning mouth, and tongue eruptions (116431).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, common adverse effects include blue or green urine and urethritis (116394, 116409, 116423, 116424, 116430, 116444). Increased frequency of urination and urinary tract burning have also been reported (116388, 116414, 116417, 116419, 116424, 116430). Blue urine has also occurred when methylene blue is given for chromopertubation during laparoscopy (116375). When used intravenously, dysuria has been reported (116431).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, methylene blue has resulted in dose-dependent reductions in red cell count and hemoglobin, occasionally with anemia, and increases in methemoglobin. The rate of having methemoglobin levels greater than 3.5% during treatment was 1.3% (116414, 116417, 116432). In another clinical trial, there was a case of megaloblastic anemia requiring vitamin B12 injections following use of methylene blue. The relationship with methylene blue is unclear (116423).\n\nMethemoglobinemia has been reported following use of high doses of methylene blue for chromopertubation during laparoscopy (116375, 116379, 116431).\n\nWhen used intravenously, hemolysis has been reported.

Although there is interest in using oral methylene blue for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of methylene blue for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral methylene blue is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nClinical research in patients with moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking methylene blue 138 mg daily for 24 or 50 weeks modestly improves cognition when compared with placebo. However, there was no improvement with doses of 69 mg or 228 mg daily. The effect of methylene blue on cognition in patients with mild Alzheimer disease is unclear due to a lack of worsening symptoms in the placebo group over the 24-week period in this study (116417).\n\nA stabilized version of the reduced form of methylene blue, the dihydromethanesulfonate salt of leucomethylthioninium, has also been investigated. Clinical research in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer disease, most taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, shows that taking leucomethylthioninium 75 mg or 125 mg twice daily for 15 months does not reduce the rate of progression when compared with taking 4 mg twice daily as control (116432). Another clinical trial specifically in patients with mild Alzheimer disease shows that taking leucomethylthioninium 4 mg or 100 mg twice daily as monotherapy for 18 months modestly reduces the rate of progression when compared with taking leucomethylthioninium 4 mg twice daily as add-on with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, with the effect of the 4 mg and 100 mg monotherapy doses appearing comparable (116414).

Although there is interest in using oral methylene blue for ALS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of methylene blue for this condition.\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral methylene blue is beneficial in patients with claustrophobia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with claustrophobia shows that taking methylene blue following a series of claustrophobic chamber exposures as part of fear extinction training has differential effects on fear renewal during a repeat exposure. In patients with low-end fear following training, having taken methylene blue results in less fear during a repeat exposure after 1 month when compared with having taken placebo. However, fear was increased during a repeat exposure in patients who had taken methylene blue and had moderate to high levels of post-training fear. Taking methylene blue modestly increased memory recall 1 month post-exposure therapy when compared with taking placebo. Methylene blue was taken in doses of approximately 87 mg 3 times: immediately following the completion of training, before bed that evening, and upon awakening the next morning (116424). It is unclear if taking methylene blue is beneficial for other types of anxiety.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral methylene blue is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder.\nA small crossover study in patients with bipolar disorder treated with lamotrigine shows that adding methylene blue 65 mg 3 times daily for 3 months has moderate to large beneficial effects on depression and anxiety, but not mania, when compared with adding methylene blue 5 mg 3 times daily as control.

Although there is interest in using oral methylene blue for cognitive impairment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of methylene blue for this condition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral methylene blue is beneficial in patients with COVID-19.\nA clinical trial in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19 shows that taking methylene blue modestly improves oxygen saturation over a 5-day period and at discharge, and overall disease severity at discharge, when compared with not taking methylene blue. There was no effect on the length of hospitalization or mortality rate 3 months post-discharge. Methylene blue was given as 1 mg/kg every 8 hours for 2 days and then every 12 hours for 5 days. All patients also received standard care including remdesivir, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and/or anticoagulants (116408). Another clinical trial in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 shows that taking a syrup containing methylene blue and other ingredients modestly improves oxygen saturation and rate of respiration 3 and 5 days after treatment initiation when compared with standard care only. The length of hospital stay was reduced, but the mortality rate was not reduced. In this study, the colorless reduced form of methylene blue (leucomethylene blue) was given as 1 mg/kg every 8 hours for 2 days and then every 12 hours for 12 days. Dextrose, N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin C were included in the syrup as part of the methylene blue reduction process (116409). It is unclear if any effect is due to leucomethylene blue, other ingredients, or the combination. Also, the validity of both studies is limited due to the lack of blinding and single-center design.\nless\nDepression.

It is unclear if oral methylene blue is beneficial in patients with malaria.\nThere has been interest in the use of oral methylene blue for malaria, largely based on anecdotal evidence from the early 1900s. A systematic review describes this historical evidence as well as more contemporary clinical data (116444). One small, open-label and uncontrolled study in adults shows that taking methylene blue 780 mg daily as monotherapy for 7 days results in 100% cure rate at 28-day follow-up and taking this dose of methylene blue for 3 or 5 days results in at least 85% cure rate. This systematic review also reported findings from clinical trials in children taking methylene blue in addition to conventional antimalarial agents. The overall findings were mixed as to whether adding methylene blue was beneficial for improving parasite clearance in this population. In these studies, methylene blue was used orally in single or divided doses of 4 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg daily for 3 days (116444). The validity of the available research is limited by a lack of blinding, appropriate comparator groups, and meta-analysis.\nless\nMemory.

Some methylene blue is metabolized to azure B (116431). In vitro, methylene blue is metabolized by cytochrome P450s 1A2, 2C19, and 2D6, as well as by uridine-5-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 and 1A9 (116431).\nExcretion\nWhen methylene blue is taken orally in modified release tablets, the elimination half-life ranged from 6-27 hours. Approximately 23% to 40% of methylene blue is excreted without undergoing metabolism over a period of up to 72 hours (116366, 116388). When given intravenously, the half-life of methylene blue is 24 hours. Approximately 40% of methylene blue is excreted without undergoing metabolism (116388, 116431).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMethylene blue, or methylthioninium chloride, is a synthetic blue dye used in medicine (116411, 116418, 116426, 116431).\nAnti-aging effects\nMethylene blue is of interest to slow aging. In skin fibroblasts in vitro, methylene blue prevents cell death and increases cell proliferation. Skin thickness and hydration are also improved in vitro. Mechanisms of action include its antioxidant effects as well as upregulation of the proteins elastin and collagen (116426).\nAntimalarial effects\nMethylene blue is of interest for the treatment of malaria. In laboratory and human research, methylene blue inhibits Plasmodium falciparum (116444).\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) protective effects\nMethylene blue is of interest for reducing COVID-19 symptoms (116408, 116409, 116410). In laboratory and/or clinical research, methylene blue has various effects that might play a role in mitigating symptoms, including the inhibition of nitric oxide synthases, inflammation, and methemoglobinemia (116410). In vitro, methylene blue has antiviral effects against SARS-COV-2 and inhibits interaction of the virus with ACE2 receptors (116408).\nImmune effects\nMethylene blue is of interest for immune health. However, the effect of methylene blue on immune health has not been investigated in human research.\nMetabolic effects\nIn vitro, methylene blue inhibits cytochrome P450s (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, uridine-5-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 and 1A9, P-glycoprotein, organic cation transporter 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, and MATE2-K. Methylene blue also induces CYP1A2 (116431).\n\nAdditionally, methylene blue is a substrate of CYP 1A2, 2C19, 2D6 and P-glycoprotein (116431).\nMethemoglobin protective effects\nIn red blood cells, the enzyme NADPH-dependent diaphorase reduces methylene blue to leucomethylene blue, which then reduces methemoglobin to hemoglobin (116378, 116431).\nNeurological effects\nMethylene blue is of interest for its potential beneficial effects on cognitive function in both healthy individuals and in individuals with cognitive decline. In the brain, methylene blue is thought to donate electrons to the electron transport chain, promoting energy production. Cognitive-enhancing effects of methylene blue have been shown in animal models (116426, 116428, 116429). Human research has found that taking a single dose of methylene blue results in some neurological benefit while undergoing attention and short-term memory tasks based on functional magnetic resonance imaging. There was no effect on cerebrovascular reactivity, suggesting that any cognitive enhancing effects of methylene blue are not due to changes in cerebral blood flow or vascular tone (116415, 116416).\n\nLaboratory research has found that methylene blue inhibits amyloid-beta, tau and huntingtin protein misfolding and aggregation, possibly preventing or slowing Alzheimer or Huntington disease (116426, 116428, 116429). Methylene blue also seems to play a role in cellular signaling in the control of the expression of proteins involved in cell protection, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes, as well as protection against the degeneration of neurons, and inducing the formation of mitochondria (116428, 116429). Laboratory research has also found that methylene blue inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B, involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine (116428)."

Most clinical research shows that MSM is modestly beneficial when used alone or in combination with other ingredients.\nClinical research shows that taking MSM 1.5-6 grams orally in two to three divided doses daily, either alone or in combination with glucosamine, can modestly improve joint function and some symptoms of osteoarthritis such as pain and swelling (12469, 14335, 17127, 19312). However, MSM does not seem to reduce stiffness or total symptom score (14335). Also, some patients may not consider the modest benefit to be clinically significant (17127).\n\nSome clinical research has evaluated MSM in combination with other ingredients. One clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking MSM 500 mg, glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with greater reductions in pain and osteoarthritis scores when compared with glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate alone (96447). Clinical studies using combination products containing MSM 5 grams daily and boswellic acid 7.2 mg daily with or without vitamin C (Lignisul, Triterpenol; Artosulfur C, Laborest Italia S.p.A), orally for 60 days show reductions in anti-inflammatory drug use, but conflicting results for pain reduction (19313, 96446).

Following ingestion of 1-3 grams, MSM is detectable at levels of 0.42-3.4 mmol/kg of brain tissue (12351). MSM is found in human cerebrospinal fluid in concentrations of 0-25 micromol/L (14335).\nExcretion\nIn animal research, giving DMSO resulted in MSM excretion in the urine, but not the feces (10625, 47901).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMSM is a naturally occurring compound that is a metabolite of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Unlike DMSO, MSM is an odorless substance (10625, 47901). In the body, about 15% of ingested DMSO is converted to MSM. Commercially, MSM is produced by combining DMSO and hydrogen peroxide to produce MSM and water (14335).\n\nMSM is a source of sulfur for synthesis of the amino acids cysteine and methionine. Incorporation of MSM-derived sulfur into methionine is regulated by a limiting step involving micro-organisms in the intestinal lumen (3501).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMSM might have anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro, MSM displayed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the oxidative function of stimulated neutrophils (63890) and reducing levels of nuclear factor-kappaB, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (96448). Also, in humans, MSM seems to reduce homocysteine levels, possibly by donating methyl groups (14335). However, clinical research shows that taking MSM daily for 12 weeks does not change plasma concentrations of IL-1-beta, IL-6, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) when compared with placebo (114751). Also, MSM does not appear to decrease CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (14335).\nAntiarthritic effects\nMSM is primarily used for osteoarthritis (OA). Preliminary research suggests MSM might inhibit degenerative changes in joints in animal models of osteoarthritis (8576). It might also stabilize cell membranes, slow or stop leakage from injured cells, and scavenge hydroxyl free radicals which trigger inflammation (17127). It also has anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa-B transcription (115344). However, human research suggests that MSM does not change plasma levels of procollagen type II C-terminal propeptide or collagen type II cleavage, which are markers of collagen synthesis and degradation, respectively, when compared with placebo (114751). In animal research, MSM promotes cartilage formation by increasing expression of SOX-9, a transcription factor important for chondrocyte differentiation. In an animal model of posttraumatic ankle OA, oral MSM given for 8 weeks slows radiographic progression similarly to weekly intra-articular methylprednisolone and prevents histopathological worsening to a greater extent than methylprednisolone (115344).\nAnticancer effects\nMSM delays chemically-induced colon cancer onset in animals (3502). A 4% MSM solution delays the latency period between induction and onset of chemically-induced mammary tumors or cancers in rats (3503).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn humans, MSM seems to reduce urine and blood malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and improve antioxidant status, suggesting that it might reduce lipid peroxidation (14335, 19320, 19323). In an animal model of periodontitis, MSM reduced levels of MDA in the mandibular tissue (116646). Also, glutathione levels were restored (116646).\nBone effects\nIn humans, MSM is of interest for periodontitis. In an animal model of periodontitis, MSM reduces alveolar bone loss (116646).\nHair growth effects\nMSM may affect hair growth. A study in mice with induced hair loss suggests that applying MSM 10% solution alone or in combination with minoxidil 5% solution once a day for 3 weeks increases hair growth, number of hair follicles, and diameter of hair follicles when compared with untreated controls (111755).\nMuscle endurance effects\nResearchers suspect that MSM might enhance the healing of exercise-induced muscle damage, but evidence is conflicting. In one clinical trial, consuming MSM for 10 days prior to an extended running exercise attenuated an increase in creatine kinase (CK) and bilirubin (19320). However, in another clinical trial, consuming MSM for 21 days prior to an extended running exercise did not lead to changes in serum levels of CK, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to placebo (96448). Additional clinical research has found an increased trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and reduced homocysteine levels in athletes taking MSM (96448)."

Oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin seem to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with diabetes or other medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces fasting blood glucose by around 22 mg/dL, reduces glycated hemoglobin by 0.85%, and reduces fasting insulin by 3.8 mU/mL when compared with placebo or control (113987). The validity of this analysis is limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including population, background treatments, and outcomes. Most of these studies were conducted in the Middle East, so it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\n\nA meta-analysis of 7 small heterogeneous clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking milk thistle containing silymarin 210-600 mg alone or with other ingredients daily for up to 6 months reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin when compared with control. Sub-group analyses suggest that studies conducted for less than 3 months seem to have a greater glycemic benefit than those lasting 3 months or longer. Furthermore, there was a greater glycemic benefit when milk thistle was used in combination with other natural ingredients (105054). Most studies in the analysis used silymarin in divided doses of 420-600 mg daily, while only one study used 200 mg daily (15102, 63190, 97626, 105054). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with diabetes or other medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces fasting blood glucose by around 22 mg/dL, reduces glycated hemoglobin by 0.85%, and reduces fasting insulin by 3.8 mU/mL when compared with placebo or control (113987). The validity of this analysis is limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including population, background treatments, and outcomes. Most of these studies were conducted in the Middle East, so it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\n\nMost studies of combination products have been conducted in Italy and involve a specific product (Berberol, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle standardized to silymarin 105-210 mg with tree turmeric standardized to berberine 500-1000 mg (96141, 105054). In addition to improving glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes (105054), this product has shown glycemic benefit in patients with concomitant obesity and metabolic syndrome (97624) and in patients with type 1 diabetes (96142).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if oral or topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with acne when used alone or in combination with other treatments.\nA small clinical trial in patients with acne vulgaris shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to silymarin 140 mg daily for 2 months does not improve acne severity based on the Global Acne Grading system scale when compared with doxycycline 100 mg daily, and silymarin is less effective than doxycycline when evaluated using the Acne Severity Index (ASI) scale. In addition, using silymarin in combination with doxycycline does not appear to be more effective than doxycycline alone (101160).\n\nThere is also interest in using milk thistle topically for acne. A small quasi-experimental study in adults with mild to moderate acne suggests that applying silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily for 3 months improves global acne scores and appearance of acne when compared to baseline, but not when compared with biweekly salicylic acid chemical peels (113143). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the use of subjective outcomes. Similarly, observational research in patients aged 12-25 years with mild-to-moderate acne suggests that applying a specific cream (Cleanance Comedomed, Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetique) containing milk thistle fruit extract 25% twice daily for 8-12 weeks as initial or add-on therapy is associated with moderate improvements in acne scores when compared to baseline (111175). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Further, most patients were also prescribed other skincare products or treatments.\n\nTopical milk thistle has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small open-label study conducted in Korea in adults with acne vulgaris shows that applying a specific topical product (Silymarin CF, Skinceuticals) containing silymarin 0.5%, vitamin C 15%, salicylic acid 0.5% and ferulic acid 0.5%, twice daily for 3 months moderately improves acne scores when compared to baseline (110488). A similar open-label study conducted in Brazil in adults with acne shows that applying a serum with this same combination and concentration of ingredients once daily for 12 weeks improves investigator's global assessment of acne severity, global lesion count, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, skin clarity, skin tone evenness, and overall skin appearance and reduces skin surface oil when compared to baseline. Additionally, an open-label study conducted in the US and Germany in adults with acne shows that applying this same serum daily for 4 weeks in addition to prescription topical acne medications reduces investigator-assessed erythema, dryness, and scaling when compared to baseline (113985). In the aforementioned studies, it is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of the studies is also limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAcute kidney injury (AKI). It is unclear if oral milk thistle extract reduces the incidence of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in hospitalized patients in Iran shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily for the duration of vancomycin treatment, ranging from 7 to 14 days, reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury, but not hospital length of stay or need for kidney replacement therapy, compared with placebo (114909). The validity of these results is limited by the use of a per-protocol analysis.\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, as evidence is conflicting.\nSome preliminary research shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for one month to 4 years improves some liver function tests (2613, 2618, 17228, 63260, 63339). Some studies also report improvements in liver histology and survival (2616, 17228, 63278). However, in other studies, taking a similar dose of the same product for 3 months to 2 years is not associated with any benefit over placebo (7321, 7322, 7355, 63158). A meta-analysis of clinical research also shows that milk thistle extract does not reduce mortality or complications related to liver disease in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (63192). Reasons for the conflicting findings are unclear but might relate to the low methodological quality of many of these studies.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nOne preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times a day plus cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg daily for one month decreases the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms when compared with placebo plus cetirizine (18105).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nA small, single-blind clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking milk thistle 450 mg daily for 3 months improves scores on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) when compared with placebo (113978). However, another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily for 6 months does not improve MMSE or Clinical Dementia Rating scores when compared with placebo (114913).\n\nOther preliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin orally twice daily for 3 months to 2 years may stabilize mental functioning in patients with Alzheimer disease when compared to baseline (63223). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAmanita mushroom poisoning. While an intravenous milk thistle constituent, silibinin, has been studied for treating Amanita mushroom poisoning, this product is not readily available in the U.S.\nPreliminary evidence from uncontrolled studies shows that administering silibinin, a constituent of milk thistle, intravenously (IV) within 48 hours of Amanita phalloides (death cap) mushroom poisoning, followed by oral therapy, may lessen liver damage (2615, 63293). However, silibinin is not readily available in the US.\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for preventing atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.\nA clinical study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting shows that taking oral milk thistle constituent silymarin 400 mg daily 3 days before surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the single-center study design (116131).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nA small clinical study in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia shows that adding milk thistle extract (Liversil, Rose Pharmed Pharmaceutical Company) 240 mg twice daily for 3 months to tamsulosin improves prostate symptom scores, irritation, obstruction, prostate volume, and post-void residuals, but not serum prostate specific antigen levels, when compared with placebo plus tamsulosin (114910). However, it is unclear whether the noted improvements are clinically significant.\n\nMilk thistle has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 190 mg along with selenium 80 mcg orally three times daily for 6 months may improve lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary flow rates, and residual volumes in adults aged 45-70 years with BPH when compared with placebo (88155). It is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, selenium, or the combination.\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with beta-thalassemia suggest that oral silymarin, a constituent of milk thistle, reduces serum ferritin levels.\nMost small clinical studies and meta-analyses of these studies show that taking silymarin in conjunction with conventional iron chelation medications such as deferiprone, deferasirox, or deferoxamine, is more effective for reducing serum ferritin levels than taking a conventional medication alone (88154, 98452, 107375). In one meta-analysis, the combination of silymarin and deferasirox appeared to be more effective than combinations with other iron chelation medications (107375). However, one preliminary clinical study in patients 12 years of age and older with beta-thalassemia shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months, in conjunction with deferoxamine, does not improve serum ferritin when compared with deferoxamine alone (63212). This difference in outcome is likely due to the shorter duration of therapy. Silymarin also does not seem to affect total iron binding capacity or liver iron concentration in patients with beta-thalassemia (107375).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with acral erythema due to capecitabine.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a gel containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 1% twice daily to the hands and feet, starting from the first day of chemotherapy and continuing for 9 weeks thereafter, prolongs the time to onset of acral erythema and decreases its severity when compared with placebo in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are receiving capecitabine for the first time (95022).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. Results of clinical studies are mixed over whether oral milk thistle prevents or improves chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity.\nOne small clinical study in children and adults up to age 21 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) shows that taking a specific product containing the milk thistle constituent silibinin (Siliphos, Thorne Research, Inc.) 80-320 mg (depending on patient weight) daily for 28 days concurrently with chemotherapy does not improve LFTs or bilirubin levels when compared with placebo (63218).\n\nAnother small clinical study in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily with meals for 4 weeks does not improve fatty liver grading or LFTs when compared with placebo (105795). A similar small clinical study in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, with or without paclitaxel shows that taking this same milk thistle extract 140 mg three times daily for 9 weeks attenuates an increase in fatty liver grade liver grade but does not consistently improve LFTs after each course of chemotherapy (114914). Conversely, a large clinical study in children aged 5-14 with elevated liver enzymes and receiving chemotherapy for ALL shows that taking silymarin 70 mg capsules twice daily or 50 mg syrup three times daily for 9 months modestly improves aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels, but does not improve alkaline phosphatase or albumin levels (113144).\n\nObservational research in patients with a variety of solid tumors and elevated LFTs due to chemotherapy or targeted therapy suggests that taking silymarin 150-900 mg daily is associated with reduced or stabilized LFTs in over half of patients; however, doses above 300-450 mg daily don't seem to have much more benefit (111176). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for the prevention of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to 70% to 80% silymarin (Liverherb, Amin Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg orally three times daily with meals, starting 24-48 hours before cisplatin and continuing until the end of three 21-day cycles, does not prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity when compared with placebo (95025).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in adults with cancer receiving cisplatin chemotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Livergol, Goldaru) containing milk thistle 140 mg three times daily for 3 months improves overall symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo, with the possible exception of hyposthesia to touch and pins and needles sensation which had worsened only in the placebo group (113979).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin are beneficial for cirrhosis from various causes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 420 mg orally daily for up to 4 years might improve liver function tests and decrease mortality in people with cirrhosis due to a variety of causes (2616, 63145, 63278, 63340). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research evaluating milk thistle studies for the treatment of various liver diseases shows that effect sizes are generally small or lack statistical significance (63161). An observational study in adults with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis suggests that taking milk thistle 150 mg 2-3 times daily for at least 30 days in combination with anti-viral therapy is associated with lower mortality and liver transplantation rates at 1- and 2-year follow up and greater improvement in international normalized ratio, model for end-stage liver disease score, and the Charlson comorbidity index at 1-year follow-up when compared with anti-viral therapy alone (113986).\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for reducing the risk of nephropathy from contrast agents.\nPopulation research in Taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis has found that taking silymarin daily for at least 90 days during a one-year period does not reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy during the following four or more years (98453).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for COVID-19.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring non-invasive oxygen support shows that taking a specific milk thistle product (SinaLive, Exir Nano Sina Company), 70 mg orally three times daily for 2 weeks, does not improve time to symptom resolution, lung scores, or length of stay when compared with placebo (109504).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in critically ill patients with trauma-induced liver injury.\nOne small clinical study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to trauma-induced liver injury shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) containing silymarin 140 mg three times daily for 14 days reduces markers of liver injury, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), when compared with placebo (105793). Whether this milk thistle extract improves morbidity, mortality, or length of ICU stay in these patients is unclear.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for improving kidney function in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months, in combination with conventional treatment decreases the urine albumin to creatinine ratio when compared with placebo. However, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate are not improved (63250).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials in adults with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking a specific combination product (Berberol, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle extract 105 mg and tree turmeric extract 588 mg twice daily for 3 months, along with diet and exercise, reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by an average of 34 mg/dL when compared with diet and exercise alone. There was no effect on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels (101158). The studies included in this meta-analysis are generally of low quality, lasted for no more than 12 months, and sometimes include patients with statin intolerance (95019, 96140, 101158). Other clinical research shows that taking a similar product (Berberol K, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle extract 105 mg, tree turmeric extract of berberine 500 mg, and monacolin K and KA 10 mg, taken once daily for 3 months along with diet and exercise, reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by about 28% when compared with diet and exercise alone in patients with hypercholesterolemia (97625). It is possible that any benefit of this product is due to the monacolin content. It is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA specific combination product containing milk thistle (Iberogast, Medical Futures, Inc.) seems to improve symptoms of dyspepsia. The combination includes milk thistle plus peppermint leaf, German chamomile, caraway, licorice, clown's mustard plant, celandine, angelica, and lemon balm (19532). A meta-analysis of clinical research using this combination product shows that taking 1 mL orally three times daily over a period of 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo (13089).\nless\nEndometriosis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with endometriosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with ovarian endometrioma shows that taking a specific silymarin product (Goldaru Pharma) 140 mg twice daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain scores, but not other sexual function scores, when compared with placebo (110486). However, some researchers have also recommended to avoid using milk thistle in estrogen-sensitive conditions, such as endometriosis, due to its estrogenic effects (93025, 93026).\nless\nGambling disorder. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for gambling disorder.\nA small clinical study in adults with gambling disorder shows that taking milk thistle 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks and then 300 mg daily for the next 6 weeks does not improve symptoms associated with gambling disorder, including gambling urges, thoughts, and behaviors, or improve symptoms of anxiety and depression when compared with placebo (113974). The interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample size and a strong placebo effect.\nless\nHepatitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin may improve hepatitis symptoms. It is unclear whether these products can improve liver function in these patients.\nIn people with hepatitis due to a variety of causes, taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, and scleral icterus, but does not improve liver function tests (LFTs) (63210, 63317). However, some improvements in LFTs are seen with a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) taken as 160-360 mg orally daily for 2 weeks to 3 months (63320, 63321). However, there are methodological problems with these latter studies.\nless\nHepatitis B. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts may improve liver function in people with hepatitis B, although it is unclear if these products can improve disease-related complications.\nPreliminary clinical studies suggest that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 28 days to one year, or a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) 240 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, improves liver function tests (LFTs) and liver histology (7356, 63263, 63299). However, another study shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 5-25 days has no effect of LFTs (63288). A meta-analysis of clinical research and a review conclude that any clinical effect of milk thistle in people with viral hepatitis is very limited and results suggest that it lacks a significant effect on mortality, liver disease complications, or liver histology (17228, 63192).\nless\nHepatitis C. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts may improve liver function but do not seem to reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 3-12 months, or a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) 240 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, improves liver function tests (LFTs) and liver histology (7356, 63299). However, other studies report that taking silymarin 125-140 mg three times daily for up to one year, 166 mg twice daily for 3 months, or 400 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve serum HCV RNA levels, anti-HCV antibody levels, LFTs, or hepatomegaly (13170, 63208, 63247, 63288, 108658). Also, taking higher doses of silymarin, up to 700 mg three times daily for 6 months, does not have a significant effect on serum HCV RNA levels or LFTs when compared with placebo (63251). A meta-analysis of clinical research and a review conclude that any clinical effect of milk thistle in people with viral hepatitis is limited and most results show that milk thistle lacks a significant effect on mortality, liver disease complications, or liver histology (17228, 63192, 88156).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with HCV-related advanced chronic liver disease shows that taking a specific milk thistle combination product containing silybinphospholipid complex 303 mg, vitamin D 10 mcg, and vitamin E 15 mg (Realsil 100 D, Ibi Lorenzini), twice daily for 12 months, improves liver stiffness scores, but not liver fibrosis scores, when compared with control (108659). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHyperlipoproteinemia. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia secondary to liver disease.\nOne very small crossover study shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for 7 months does not significantly improve cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia secondary to liver disease when compared with placebo (63255).\nless\nHypoxic liver injury. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for reducing liver injury in patients with hypoxia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients presenting to the emergency department with hypoxia shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 280 mg every 8 hours for 3 days reduces markers of liver injury, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), when compared with placebo (103871).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for patients undergoing in vitro fertilization.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 70 mg orally three times daily in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) lowers the proportion of early and total apoptosis of follicle cells during in vitro fertilization due to male infertility. However, it does not have an effect on the number of oocytes retrieved or the thickness of the endometrium when compared with HCG plus placebo (63227).\nless\nLactation. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for increasing milk production.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to 60% silymarin (BIO-C, Milte Italia S.r.l.) 240 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not increase milk production when compared with placebo in mothers of preterm newborns (95027).\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with melasma.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with melasma shows that applying silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily for 3 months moderately improves melasma appearance scores when compared to baseline. These improvements were similar to hydroquinone cream 2% (110489). One small clinical trial in females with melasma shows that application of silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily to the affected area for 3 months is as effective for improving melasma area and severity as a specific type of laser therapy (low fluence Q switched ND:YAG 1064 nm) (105791).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral milk thistle reduces menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.\nOne small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking milk thistle fruit extract 200 mg, containing 80% silymarin, twice daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce the number and severity of daily hot flashes and overall climacteric symptoms when compared with taking placebo (105053). This finding is limited by incomplete reporting and potentially inadequate blinding. Other preliminary clinical research has evaluated milk thistle in combination with black cohosh, dong quai, red clover, American ginseng, and chasteberry (Phyto-Female, SupHerb), with some evidence of benefit for reducing hot flashes and night sweats. (19552).\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for MASLD.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle monotherapy may decrease the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) when compared with no intervention or placebo. (117139). The validity of these findings are limited by insufficient power, risk of bias, and heterogeneity across studies.\n\nFurthermore, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle extract equivalent to 51.6 mg of silybin twice daily for 6 months reduces liver stiffness, but not levels of ALT, AST, or bilirubin when compared with placebo (114918). A moderate-sized, open-label, non-controlled study in patients with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle standardized to silymarin 150 mg twice daily for 6 months does not improve liver stiffness or liver enzymes when compared with essential phospholipids. It is unclear if any changes in these outcomes are statistically significant when compared to baseline (114462). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\n\nHowever, a clinical study in Romania in adults with MASLD shows that taking a specific combination product, Esentin Trio, containing milk thistle (standardized to silymarin 100 mg), vitamin E, and essential phospholipids twice daily for 6 months reduces liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase) and improves liver fibrosis and steatosis when compared with baseline. Additionally, the milk thistle combination improved blood glucose, body mass, and lipid profiles compared to baseline (117138). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, vitamin E, essential phospholipids, or the combination.\n\nAlso review milk thistle's effectiveness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a similar condition.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral silymarin, a constituent of milk thistle, seems to improve some of the laboratory abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of 11 low-quality clinical trials in adults with metabolic syndrome, conducted in Asia and Africa, shows that silymarin, 140-2100 mg daily for 45 days to 12 months, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo (107374).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with MS shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin twice daily for 3-24 months may stabilize clinical symptoms of MS when compared to baseline (63223). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin may slightly improve markers of liver function patients with NAFLD.\nFour meta-analyses of up to 23 mostly small clinical trials in patients with NAFLD show that taking milk thistle products containing a total of silymarin 140-2100 mg daily, either alone or in combination with other ingredients, for 8-48 weeks reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 7-13 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 9-17 IU/L when compared with control (97622, 105051, 113976, 113982). However, these changes in liver enzymes may not be clinically impactful and some experts note that serum AST levels do not reliably reflect the spectrum of liver histology in patients with NAFLD (98130).\n\nMetabolic indices have also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of up to 20 mostly small clinical studies in patients with NAFLD shows that taking milk thistle for up to 48 weeks slightly improves serum lipids when compared with control (113976). A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD and a body-mass index (BMI) of at least 35 kg/m2 shows that taking milk thistle extract 140 mg 4 times daily for 8 weeks, in addition to lifestyle modifications, reduces BMI by approximately 1 kg/m2 when compared with placebo with lifestyle modifications (108657). However, another small clinical trial in adults with NAFLD and a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2 shows that taking a specific silymarin product (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceuticals) 140 mg three times daily for 4 weeks did not reduce BMI or improve liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, when compared with placebo (110484). A meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials also shows there is little to no change in BMI associated with silymarin use in these patients (113976).\n\nOne small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a specific combination product (Eurosil 85, MEDAS SL) containing milk thistle extract standardized to silymarin 540 mg and vitamin E 36 mg daily for 3 months, in addition to following a low-calorie diet, does not appear to improve NAFLD-Fibrosis score or fatty liver index (FLI) when compared with following a low-calorie diet alone (96261), though a meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in patients with NAFLD shows that taking milk thistle for 12-24 weeks does reduce FLI when compared with control (113976).\n\nAlso review milk thistle's effectiveness in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a similar condition.\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with NASH.\nClinical research in patients with NASH shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 700 mg three times daily for 48 weeks improves fibrosis in more patients when compared with placebo (96107). However, there is no significant between-group difference in global histological improvement with this product (96107) or with a specific silymarin product (Legalon, Rottapharm Madaus, Mylan) 420 or 700 mg three times daily for 48-50 weeks (101150). Pooling 1 of these clinical studies (96107) into a meta-analysis with another clinical trial that evaluated milk thistle in combination with phosphatidylcholine and vitamin E suggests an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage when compared with placebo (113984). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nMetabolic indices have also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with NASH or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that taking milk thistle reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by about 13 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by about 17 IU/L, serum triglycerides by about 23 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by about 2 mg/dL, but does not alter gamma-glutamyl transferase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, or insulin resistance when compared with control (113982). However, trials on NAFLD and NASH were not analyzed separately which limits the generalizability of these findings to patients with NASH specifically. The dose and duration of milk thistle treatment was also not described.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nA meta-analysis of 11 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle does not reduce body weight or body mass index when compared with placebo or control (113987). A very small open-label study in adult females with obesity suggests that taking a specific milk thistle extract product (Neocholal-S, Italmex) 151.5 mg, containing silybin 45 mg, twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight but may reduce fasting blood glucose levels and insulin resistance when compared to baseline (113980). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group and very small sample size.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with OCD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking milk thistle leaf extract 200 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks has a limited effect on OCD symptom scores when compared to baseline, but does not provide any benefit over fluoxetine 10 mg three times daily (63219).\nless\nParkinson disease. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin orally twice daily for 3 months to 24 months may stabilize clinical symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease when compared to baseline (63223). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPostpartum complications. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in postpartum patients with an episiotomy.\nPreliminary clinical research in postpartum patients shows that applying milk thistle 3% in Eucerin ointment twice daily to the suture site for 10 days reduces episiotomy pain and improves the healing rate when compared with placebo. The milk thistle product was prepared with an ethanolic extract of the seeds to provide 1.53% silybin (107373).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with a history of prostate cancer who have had radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy shows that taking a dietary supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 160 mg, soy isoflavones (Novasoy, ADM) 62.5 mg, lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Products Industries, Ltd.) 15 mg, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants orally daily for 10 weeks increases the time it takes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to double by 2.6-fold when compared with placebo (60361).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with dermatitis due to radiation.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy shows that applying a specific topical product containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin (Leviaderm, Madaus GmbH) significantly reduces the incidence of radiation dermatitis and prolongs the time to the onset of radiation dermatitis when compared with applying a panthenol-containing cream (63239). Additionally, meta-analysis pooling this study (63239) with one other small clinical study also shows that applying a cream or gel containing milk thistle extract reduces the incidence radiation dermatitis when compared with control (113674).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for rheumatoid arthritis.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on conventional RA medications shows that taking milk thistle (Silymarin Forte, Zenyth Pharmaceuticals SRL) 300 mg, in addition to standard RA medications, daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, the duration of morning stiffness, severity of disease activity, and fatigue, depression and anxiety scores when compared with standard RA medicationsl (114915). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and lack of a placebo control.\nless\nToxin-induced liver damage. Most small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts or constituents may reduce liver injury in people exposed to some, but not all, toxins and medications known to cause liver damage.\nTaking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for up to one month improves liver function tests (LFTs) in people with abnormal LFTs due to chronic occupational exposure to paints or organic solvents such as toluene or xylene (2614, 63280).\n\nMilk thistle extract has also shown some benefit for reducing drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In patients on isotretinoin therapy for acne, taking a specific milk thistle extract containing silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg daily for 30 days improves LFTs when compared with placebo (102852). A small clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who were initiating therapy with fingolimod shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) containing silymarin 140 mg daily for 6 months prevents fingolimod-induced LFT elevations when compared with placebo (105794). In patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin, taking the milk thistle constituent silibinin 70 mg orally three times daily for 6-12 months reduces the rate of liver toxicity to 14% compared with 53% in patients taking glucuronolactone 200 mg orally three times daily (63224). Additionally, in patients receiving standard treatment for tuberculosis with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 4 weeks decreases the risk of DILI by 28% when compared with placebo. About 1 in every 4 patients who take silymarin for 4 weeks would avoid DILI (95024). A small clinical study in Iran, also in adults receiving standard treatment for tuberculosis, shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks modestly improves LFTs when compared with control. None of the 16 patients in the silymarin group developed DILI compared with 2 of 21 patients in the control group; however, this finding was not statistically significant (112230). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the short study duration.\n\nHowever, taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 420 mg orally daily for 3 months does not seem to prevent liver toxicity associated with tacrine (Cognex) therapy in people with Alzheimer disease (63140). Other research in people with elevated LFTs due to long-term therapy with phenothiazine or butyrophenone antipsychotic medications shows that taking silymarin 800 mg orally daily for 3 months also does not improve LFTs when compared with placebo (63344).\n\nA retrospective study in patients with DILI of various offending agents has also found that taking a milk thistle extract, containing a median of 450 mg silybin daily for 24 days is associated with 1.7-2.8 times higher likelihood of LFT normalization when compared with control (110485).\nless\nTrichotillomania. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients 12-65 years of age shows that taking milk thistle 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and then 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, does not improve symptoms of trichotillomania when compared with placebo (99426).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients 16-75 years of age shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard medications, decreases disease activity and helps maintain remission when compared with placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis (95029).\nless\nVitiligo. It is unclear if oral milk thistle reduces the severity of this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with vitiligo shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract containing silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg twice daily along with phototherapy for 3 months does not improve the severity of vitiligo when compared with phototherapy plus placebo (102851). However, a small clinical study in patients with vitiligo undergoing hair follicle transplantation and phototherapy shows that taking this same milk thistle extract 70 mg twice daily for 3 months increases perifollicular re-pigmentation when compared with hair follicle transplantation plus phototherapy (114912). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo.\nless\nRadiation mucositis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for preventing or treating mucositis due to radiation.\nOne small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy for the first time shows that taking a specific product containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company), 140 mg three times daily starting from the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for 6 weeks thereafter, reduces the severity and prolongs the time to onset of radiation-induced mucositis when compared with placebo (95021).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate milk thistle for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nMilk thistle extracts have most often been used in doses of 140 mg three times daily for up to 4 years. Milk thistle extracts are typically standardized to silymarin content, with concentrations ranging from 70% to 80% (2613, 2614, 2618, 17228, 63210, 63260, 63263, 63278, 63280, 63299)(63317, 63339, 63340, 88154). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nMilk thistle has been used in various topical formulations, including gels and creams. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMilk thistle extract is often standardized to silymarin content. Silymarin is a complex mixture of flavonolignans, with the six present in the highest quantities being silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silidianin, and silychristin (63240, 63249, 88157, 95021, 95022). The precise percentage of silymarin measured in a milk thistle preparation depends on how many of these flavonolignans are identified by the method used (63240, 63249). Silymarin is not the same as silibinin. Silibinin is a semi purified extract that is roughly a 1:1 mixture of silybin A and silybin B (95026).\n\nOne specific milk thistle extract (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) is standardized to contain 70% to 80% silymarin (63212, 88157). Each capsule contains 175 mg of dried milk thistle seed extract, equivalent to 140 mg of silymarin (95026, 101150).\n\nAnother product containing milk thistle extract (BIO-C, Milte Italia S.r.l.) 420 mg is standardized to 60% silymarin. The silymarin in this product is micronized to improve oral bioavailability (95027).\n\nAnother product containing milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) is standardized to at least 80% silymarin and 30% silybins. Each tablet provides 140 mg silymarin (97626). One specific combination product containing tree turmeric and milk thistle extract (Berberol, PharmExtracta) is standardized to contain 60% to 80% silybin from milk thistle extract and 85% berberine from tree turmeric (95019, 96140, 96141, 96142, 97624, 101158). The same product with added monacolins (Berberol K, PharmExtracta) has also been used (97625).\n\nAn analysis of milk thistle preparations available in the US and Czech Republic shows that there is a large variability in the manufacturer-recommended dose. Also, there are issues with standardization of milk thistle products to silymarin. Analysis shows that the total concentration of silymarin in the products was 35% to 125% of declared silymarin content, possibly due to the lack of a strict definition for silymarin. Also, there was variability in the specific flavonoid and flavonolignan composition of individual products (101157). There was evidence of fungal mycotoxin contamination in 100% of the products tested, with most products having more than one mycotoxin. Some mycotoxins exceeded EU recommendations by 19 times the maximal limits in 92% of products. Furthermore, some products contained measurable levels of pesticides and evidence of bacterial contamination (101157).",

However, contradictory clinical research shows that milk thistle extract does not inhibit CYP2C9 or significantly affect levels of the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide (13712, 95026).

The silibinin component also inhibits BCRP, which transports statins from the liver into the bile for excretion.

However, results from the same pharmacokinetic study show that milk thistle does not affect the overall exposure to indinavir (8234). Furthermore, two other pharmacokinetic studies show that taking specific milk thistle extract (Legalon, Rottapharm Madaus; Thisilyn, Nature's Way) 160-450 mg every 8 hours in combination with multiple doses of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours does not reduce levels of indinavir (93578).\nless\nLEDIPASVIR\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, milk thistle might increase the levels and clinical effects of ledipasvir.\nAnimal research in rats shows that milk thistle increases the area under the curve (AUC) for ledipasvir and slows its elimination (109505).\nless\nMORPHINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of milk thistle with morphine might affect serum levels of morphine and either increase or decrease its effects.\nAnimal research shows that milk thistle reduces serum levels of morphine by up to 66% (101161). In contrast, laboratory research shows that milk thistle constituents inhibit uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT), the major phase 2 enzyme that is responsible for glucuronidation (7318, 17973).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with milk thistle.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBioavailability data for milk thistle in humans are controversial because of the complexity of the composition and the diversity of the constituents (63201).\n\nAfter oral administration of a specific silymarin product (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) in doses of 140-560 mg, silybin A accounted for 84% of measurable flavonolignans in plasma. At a higher dose of 700 mg, silybin A accounted for 54% of measurable flavonolignans, silybin B for 21%, and isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silychristin and silydianin for 4%, 8%, 11%, and 2% respectively (63217). In another study, the bioavailability of orally administered silybin was 23% to 47% and appeared to be higher when administered in a softgel capsule (63311). A silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) has been developed to increase bioavailability by up to 10-fold (63228, 95026). Following oral administration of this product, peak plasma levels of free silybin occurred at 2.4 hours, and conjugated silybin at 3.8 hours (63285). Following oral administration of silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH), peak plasma levels of all constituent flavonolignans were achieved by 2 hours (63217). Additionally, a nanocrystal formulation of milk thistle (HydroMilkthistle, Bio-Synectics, Inc) increases oral bioavailability by about 1.5-fold when compared with milk thistle raw material in humans. Plasma silybin levels from the nano-crystal formulation and raw material each reached peak plasma levels at 1 hour after ingestion. However, peak plasma concentration was 2-fold higher and area under the curve 1.5-fold higher with the nano-crystal formulation than the raw material (114917).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of silymarin are altered in patients with liver disease. The area under the curve for total silymarin flavonolignans was approximately two- to five-fold higher for patients with liver disease compared with healthy volunteers (63203, 63240).\nMetabolism\nSilymarin flavonolignans undergo rapid first-pass conjugation (63217, 63251). Clinical pharmacokinetic research also shows that the main phenolic compounds in milk thistle extract undergo phase II metabolic reactions, including glucuronidation, sulfation, and methylation (114908).\nExcretion\nSilymarin flavonolignans undergo biliary excretion (63217, 63251). After oral intake, less than 10% of silymarin is excreted in the urine, and 20% to 40% is recovered in the bile as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (63281). In another study, approximately 5% of a single dose of silymarin was excreted in the urine as silibinin (63184). The elimination half-lives for milk thistle constituents are generally less than 4 hours, with most ranging between 0.8-2.4 hours (63217, 63228, 63285).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of milk thistle are the seed and above ground parts. The seed is most commonly used medicinally. A standard milk thistle seed extract contains 70% to 80% silymarin, which is a mixture of flavonolignans including silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silydianin, silychristin A and B, and silibinin (63240, 63249, 95024, 95025, 101157, 114908). Silybin or silibinin is thought to be the most active component of silymarin (95021, 95022, 95025). Other constituents, including dehydrosilybin, desoxy-silydianin, silybinomer, and taxifolin, have also been isolated (63249, 114908).\nAnti-addictive effects\nIn vitro, milk thistle extract was able to bind to the mu-opioid receptor, the receptor involved in most of the effects of morphine (101161).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSilibinin decreases the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via down-modulation of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) (63252). Silymarin also regulates inflammatory mediators, downregulates the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotrienes as well as inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) II (95028). In laboratory research, a similar inhibition of NF-kappa B and IFN-B-dependent transcription has been seen in Huh7 cells in the presence of silibinin (63233). Silymarin is an inhibitor of inflammation mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), possibly by an effect on intracellular signaling (7859). A meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces interleukin 6 (IL-6) when compared with placebo or control (113981). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with stable rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months does not lower proinflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, when compared to baseline (110487). Similarly, clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking milk thistle extract 300 mg daily for 8 weeks does not lower C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (114915). Meta-analyses evaluating the impact of milk thistle on CRP levels in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions show mixed results (113981, 113987).\nAnticancer effects\nIn human leukocytes, silymarin protects against DNA damage caused by hydrogen peroxide, and in a mouse skin model it reduces UVB and chemically induced carcinogenesis. These effects may be attributable to the antioxidant properties of silymarin (63204, 63298, 63312). Chemically induced tumor promotion in rats can be prevented by silymarin, possibly via inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (63300). Silymarin inhibits mitogenic signaling pathways involved in proliferation of androgen-independent and androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (7319, 63148).\n\nSilybin A and silybin B, constituents of milk thistle, inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells (63243), MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and T47D human breast carcinoma cells, via a purported mitochondrial and caspase-8 mediated pathway (63232).\n\nIn vitro, silibinin has shown an affinity for binding to p-glycoprotein, a transporter thought to be involved in the drug resistance of cancer cells (11481).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSilymarin seems to decrease insulin resistance and have a protective effect on the pancreas in rats with experimentally induced diabetes mellitus (63309). This is thought to be due to silymarin's antioxidant effects. Some research suggests that oxidative stress can contribute to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, reduced insulin secretion, and insulin resistance (15102). Laboratory research suggests that silibinin reduces glycolysis from carbohydrates in a dose-dependent manner, via inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity, affecting oxidative phosphorylation, and reducing formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation (63197).\n\nAdditionally, there is interest in using silymarin for complications of diabetes, such as diabetic nephropathy, which is thought to be caused by oxidative stress and inflammation (95028). Silymarin also possesses anti-fibrotic properties via downregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta plays a role in diabetic nephropathy as it causes hardening of the glomerulus in the kidney as well as interstitial fibrosis.\nAntilipemic effects\nEarly animal experimentation with silybin demonstrated decreased cholesterol synthesis (63270) and reduced biliary excretion of cholesterol salts by 60% to 70%, while leaving biliary flow rates unchanged (63211). In perfused livers from rats fed a high-cholesterol diet, silymarin normalized the clearance of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), providing significant protection against dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia (63310). In laboratory research, silymarin and silibinin inhibited the generation of oxidized LDL, likely through antioxidant and free radical scavenging mechanisms of action (63200). Milk thistle may inhibit cholesterol acyltransferase, which leads to a reduction of cholesterol absorption and lipoprotein biosynthesis. Milk thistle has also been shown to decrease myeloperoxidase (MPO) in patients with hyperlipidemia; MPO is a marker of cardiovascular risk (95019). Milk thistle, or silymarin, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase (95028). It also decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and the amount of free VLDL that can be secreted into the intestine. By downregulating certain factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), it decreases lipid accumulation. In human research, silymarin has been shown to lower levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol (15102, 49769, 51423, 63229, 113987), although some conflicting research exists (105792).\nAntioxidant effects\nSilybin reduces lipid peroxidation in various types of cell cultures and in a rat model (63150, 63185, 63294, 63296, 63305, 63308). It also prevents the depletion of glutathione and protects DNA from degradation (95028).\n\nClinical research on the potential anti-oxidant effects of milk thistle is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle increases serum glutathione (GSH) levels (113977), while another meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows no increase in GSH (113981). A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials and an additional small clinical study do not indicate that taking milk thistle reduces malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, though 2 other meta-analyses of up to 9 clinical trials show that taking milk thistle does reduce MDA levels. Additionally, meta-analyses of up to 5 clinical trials show no effect of milk thistle on serum total antioxidant capacity (113977, 113981, 114913). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated.\nAntiviral effects\nIn cellular and human research, silibinin has been shown to reduce levels of hepatitis C viral (HCV)-RNA, inhibit the production of progeny HCV particles, and dose-dependently inhibit the fusion of HCV pseudoparticles and fluorescent liposomes (63225, 63233, 63236).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin for radiation induced mucositis. Mucositis is caused secondary to DNA damage from production of free radicals. This increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to tissue damage. Bacterial colonization then occurs, which leads to further damage and production of more inflammatory cytokines. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory via inhibition of leukotrienes and prostaglandin formation, and immunomodulatory via increases in lymphocytes and suppression of T-cell activation (95021).\n\nThere is interest in using milk thistle for chemotherapy-induced acral erythema (also known as hand-foot syndrome). This condition may be caused by a direct toxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents. It is possible that toxic metabolites of chemotherapeutic agents build up in the stratum corneum of the palms and soles. With increased pressure and temperature in these areas, inflammation occurs leading to oxidative damage and production of free radicals. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulator via suppression of T-cell activation and increasing lymphocyte proliferation. When applied topically, silymarin is thought to protect the cell membrane from damage and block the uptake of toxins (95022).\nDrug metabolizing enzyme effects\nIn laboratory and animal research, silymarin and its flavonolignan, silibinin, inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the major phase 1 hepatic enzymes (17101). However, milk thistle or silymarin does not seem to affect the metabolism of indinavir (Crixivan) or midazolam, CYP3A4 substrates, in healthy volunteers (10427, 14420, 95026). Milk thistle also does not seem to affect the metabolism of tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, in healthy volunteers (95026). This suggests that milk thistle is not a significant inhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Other research in healthy volunteers also suggests that milk thistle does not affect CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5 (13712, 95026).\n\nLaboratory research suggests that silymarin and silibinin also inhibit uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT), the major phase 2 enzyme that is responsible for glucuronidation (6450, 7089, 7318). They also inhibit the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), which transports drugs such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") into the liver (16408). Silibinin and silymarin also inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which transports statins from the liver into the bile (16408). In laboratory and animal research, silibinin also inhibits P-glycoprotein which promotes efflux of drugs into the intestine for excretion (17101, 95019).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin for ulcerative colitis (UC). UC involves an inflammatory process that is provoked by certain immune elements, microbes, and oxidative stress (95029). Silymarin possesses antioxidant properties and reduces inflammatory cytokines. Animal research suggests that treatment with silibinin, the major component of silymarin, and ursodeoxycholic acid inhibits nuclear factor (NF) kappa beta and is associated with a reduction in colitis.\nHepatoprotective effects\nAntioxidant and free radical-scavenging actions of milk thistle constituents such as silymarin and silybin are thought to be important mechanisms for their hepatoprotective effects (63153, 63204, 63264, 63272, 63282, 63289, 63331, 95024). Silymarin prevents hepatotoxicity of microcystin-LR (a toxin from the alga Microcystis aeruginosa) in rats and mice, possibly by preventing oxidation of protein-thiol groups (63207). In humans, superoxide dismutase levels in erythrocytes and lymphocytes are raised in the presence of silymarin (63262). Silymarin seems to alter outer hepatocyte cell membranes, stabilizing them and inhibiting binding and penetration of toxins such as alpha-amanitin from Amanita mushrooms (6879, 63303). It is this stabilization that may also lead to a reduction of gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (96261). Silibinin can ameliorate alpha-amanitin-induced increases in lipid peroxidation (63222). In rats, silymarin protects the liver from D-galactosamine-induced toxicity by activating enzymes in the UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis pathways, which detoxify phenols and other substances (63279). Silymarin, silibinin and silybin stimulate DNA polymerase in hepatocytes, increasing ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis, which can stimulate liver cell regeneration (6879, 63253, 63258, 63336). Silymarin and silibinin inhibit beta-glucuronidase, which is thought to reduce the hydrolysis of glucuronides into toxic metabolites in the liver and intestine (7354).\n\nA meta-analysis of 34 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle reduces aspartate aminotransferase levels by 6.5 IU/L, alanine transaminase by 9.7 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase by 15.4 IU/L when compared with control. However, there was no effect overall on gamma-glutamyl transferase or total bilirubin (113977). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated.\nNeuronal/CNS effects\nMilk thistle enhances nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC-12 neural cells and prolongs their survival in culture (63159). There is also evidence that milk thistle extract protects cultured rat hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress-induced cell death (63223).\nPsychiatric effects\nThere is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The purported mechanisms behind its efficacy are three-fold. First, oxidative stress implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including OCD, is thought to be ameliorated by silymarin, which possesses antioxidant effects and inhibits the formation of free radicals. Second, the disturbance of dopamine transmission associated with OCD may be prevented by silymarin, which appears to attenuate the loss of dopamine in the brain and improves deficits associated with dopaminergic hypofunction. Manipulation of dopamine may help to control behavior seen in OCD. Last, silymarin may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity which leads to increased levels of dopamine in the brain, and improve executive function (95023). In clinical research, supplementation with milk thistle 150 mg to 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks up to 4 months has led to symptomatic improvements in patients with trichotillomania (recurrent hair pulling), OCD related to contamination and washing obsessions, and nail biting (95023).\nRenal protective effects\nSeveral animal studies suggest that silymarin, silibinin, and silychristin can protect kidney cells from nephrotoxic drugs such as cyclosporine, cisplatin and ifosfamide (7320, 63290, 63295, 63308, 114919). Mechanisms may include prevention of lipid peroxidation (63308) and a regenerative effect on kidney cells, which is similar to the effects on hepatic cells (7320).\n\nAlternatively, laboratory and animal research suggests that silymarin has the potential to increase the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via inhibition of multi-drug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) which may decrease the renal excretion of cisplatin and increase its accumulation in the kidney (114919).\n\nIn clinical research, silymarin has not been more effective than placebo in preventing acute kidney injury secondary to cisplatin (95025). However, in other clinical research in patients taking vancomycin, silymarin reduced the risk of acute kidney injury (114909).\n\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle reduces serum creatinine levels by 0.04 mg/dL but does not affect blood urea nitrogen levels when compared with placebo or control (113977). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of miracle fruit are the berry, seed oil, and leaf (98005, 102330). The lipid fraction of the seed oil contains polyphenols, triterpenes, phytosterols, and linoleic acid (98005). The leaf is rich in flavonoids (102330). An ethanolic extract of miracle fruit contains greater flavonoid and tannin content, but similar phenolic content, when compared with an aqueous extract (106573).\nAntidiabetes effects\nThe leaves of the miracle fruit plant are traditionally used for diabetes. In one animal diabetic model, an extract of the miracle fruit leaves reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (102330). However, in a mouse model of diabetes, high doses of an ethanolic extract of miracle fruit produced only modest reductions in blood glucose (106573). Potential mechanisms of action include an increase in insulin synthesis, a reduction of inflammatory cytokines as shown in the animal model, and/or the inhibition of the carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes alpha-amylase or alpha-glucosidase as shown in vitro (102330).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, an ethanolic extract of miracle fruit has greater antioxidant activity when compared with an aqueous extract, with quercetin being the most abundant antioxidant (106573).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn a mouse model of diabetes, high doses of an ethanolic extract of miracle fruit reduce total cholesterol levels when compared with control (106573). In hamsters receiving a high cholesterol diet, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of miracle fruit leaf and seed, but not pulp, reduce levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol. An ethanolic extract of miracle fruit seed had the most potent effect, which may be related in part to two major triterpenoids, lupeol acetate and beta-amyrin acetate (106572).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using miracle fruit to improve motor function. One small clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that applying a wrist band containing miracle fruit seed oil for 3-8 hours per day for 4-6 weeks improves hand motor skills more than a placebo wrist band (98005). The mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nTaste effects\nMiracle fruit appears to act directly on the tongue to block sour taste receptor sites and convert sour tastes into sweet (15651, 15653). Miracle fruit contains a glycoprotein called miraculin that is responsible for its ability to alter taste perception (15652). Miraculin itself has no taste; it produces a sweet taste only when in contact with an acidic solution. The effect of miraculin on taste buds subsides after about 30 minutes (15652).\nWeight loss effects\nIn a mouse model of diabetes, high doses of an ethanolic extract of miracle fruit attenuate diabetes-induced increases in weight (106573)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMolybdenum is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract by a passive process (7135, 16488). Between 28% and 93% of molybdenum present in food is absorbed (16487, 16489). Peak plasma levels occur about an hour after meals (7135, 16487). Blood levels of molybdenum reflect dietary intake (16483). For people in the United States, blood levels are typically in the range of 0.3 ng/mL to 5 ng/mL, but in some areas of the world with high soil and plant food levels of molybdenum, blood levels of 170 ng/mL have been reported (16478, 16483).\nDistribution\nMolybdenum is stored in several organs, particularly the liver, kidneys, adrenal glands and bones. It is also found in the lungs, spleen, skin, and muscles (2663, 16478, 16487). The amount stored increases with dietary intake, although overall retention of dietary molybdenum is low (16478). Turnover from tissues such as the kidneys and spleen is rapid, with an estimated residence time of 3 days or less. Turnover is slower in the liver, bones, and adrenal glands, with a residence time of 63-237 days (16488). Molybdenum is also present in breast milk in variable amounts. In one study, levels ranged from undetectable to 8.4 mcg/L, while in another they decreased with time post-partum: 15 mcg/L on the first post-partum day, 4.8 mcg/L at days 7-10, 2.6 mcg/L by 1 month, and 1.4 mcg/L by 2 months. These levels are lower than those found in infant formula and cow's milk (7135, 16481, 16486).\nMetabolism\nMolybdenum forms compounds with copper in the gut, including copper molybdate and copper thiomolybdate, using sulfides generated from sulfates by bacteria in the gut (16486, 16487).\nExcretion\nHomeostatic regulation of molybdenum levels is primarily under renal control, with about 90% of ingested molybdenum being excreted in the urine within a few hours (2663, 7135, 16478). Urinary levels increase with increased dietary intake (63567).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMolybdenum is an essential trace mineral. Dietary sources include milk, cheese, cereal grains, legumes, nuts, leafy vegetables, and organ meats (2663, 16478, 16484). In plants, molybdenum is important in the process of fixing atmospheric nitrogen at the start of protein synthesis (16487). The molybdenum content of plant-derived foods varies considerably depending on the soil content in the growing area (7135). There is also considerable variation in the molybdenum content of water. One study of mineral waters reported a range of 0.22 mcg/L to 21.95 mcg/L (16486). For people in the United States, blood levels are typically in the range of 0.3 ng/mL to 5 ng/mL, but in some areas of the world with high soil and plant food levels of molybdenum, blood levels of 170 ng/mL have been reported (16478, 16483).\n\nMolybdenum can exist in several oxidation states, but is most stable in its hexavalent form (2663, 16478). A complex of molybdenum and an organic moiety called molybdopterin forms a cofactor for the enzymes sulfite oxidase, which converts sulfites to sulfates; xanthine oxidase, which converts purines to uric acid; and aldehyde oxidase, which oxidizes pyrimidines, purines, and pteridines (2663, 7135, 16478, 16480). In these oxidation reactions, molybdenum is converted between oxidation states, facilitating electron transfers (2663, 16478).\nAntitumor effects\nMolybdenum is thought to be useful for cancer prevention. In animal research, molybdenum supplementation reduced the incidence of chemically-induced mammary, esophageal, and forestomach tumors (63533, 63563).\nCopper antagonism effects\nMolybdenum can form poorly absorbed compounds with copper in the gut, inhibiting absorption of both minerals. The compounds formed include copper molybdate and copper thiomolybdate, using sulfides generated from sulfates by bacteria in the gut (16486, 16487). A molybdenum compound, tetrathiomolybdate, has been used for complexing excess copper in the treatment of Wilson disease (16492, 63365, 63579). Molybdenum may also inhibit absorption of iron, possibly by competition for intestinal brush-border receptors (16487).\nMolybdenum homeostasis\nMolybdenum deficiency is very rare, but has occurred in a patient maintained on long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without molybdenum. He presented with amino acid intolerance, and high sulfite and low sulfate levels in the urine, indicating diminished sulfite oxidase activity; and high xanthine and low uric acid levels in the urine, indicating diminished xanthine oxidase activity. Symptoms included headache, tachycardia, and mental disturbances. The level of abnormal metabolites in the urine was significantly reduced by addition of molybdenum 300 mcg/day to the TPN (7135, 16478). Preliminary data from animals, and observations in human populations with a low molybdenum intake, suggest a link between molybdenum deficiency and esophageal cancer. Further data is needed, but a suggested mechanism is intracellular accumulation of mutagenic sulfites (16478). A rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting in deficiency of the molybdenum cofactor has been described, which results in severe neuronal damage, progressive cerebral degeneration, and seizures, and is usually fatal in infancy (7135, 16478, 16479). Lack of sulfite oxidase appears to be the primary defect, causing accumulation of toxic sulfites and possibly a lack of sulfates for cells in the central nervous system to form sulfolipids and sulfoproteins (7135, 16478).\n\nElevated umbilical cord levels of molybdenum have been observed in mothers with gestational diabetes, but the significance of this is unknown (16482). People on long-term dialysis have elevated serum molybdenum levels. Free molybdenum in the plasma is removed by hemodialysis, but molybdenum bound to proteins is not, leading to accumulation (16490, 16491). The clinical significance of this is unclear."

Monolaurin strongly inhibits the production of gram-positive exotoxins at concentrations lower than those required to inhibit bacterial growth. Specifically, it inhibits toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcus enterotoxins by blocking bacterial membrane-associated signal transduction (14112, 14113). Other preliminary research shows that monolaurin inhibits induction of vancomycin resistance by the same mechanism (14111).

Constituents of Monterey pine bark include monomeric and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, flavonols, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, flavanones, taxifolin, quercetin, myricetin, dihydroquercetin, astringenen, trans-caffeic acid, trans-ferulic acid, trans-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, ferulic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, glucopyranosiduronic acid, glucopyranoside, esters, and natural organic acids (63622, 63619, 105778).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using Monterey pine extract to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). A high dietary intake of flavonoids (such as those found in Monterey pine) has been shown to exhibit a protective effect against CVD in humans (7716, 42212). In human research, Monterey pine bark extract and vitamin C resulted in a reduction in plasma levels of the inflammatory marker fibrinogen in heavy smokers when compared with vitamin C alone. However, no change was observed in light smokers (63618). In addition, antioxidant effects of Monterey pine bark extract have been shown in human studies and in vitro (63618, 63621, 63622, 63623). However, in human research, any benefit of Monterey pine bark extract on CVD risk factors is unclear (63614, 63618, 63620).\nCognitive effects\nIn human research, Monterey pine bark extract and vitamin C possibly improve cognitive function (63620). The mechanism of action is unclear.

The leaves retain a high vitamin and mineral content when dried, so moringa is sometimes cooked and used to combat malnutrition. Edible parts of moringa include the mature seeds, immature seed pods, seed oil, and leaves. Moringa seed oil is also used in cosmetics. The seed cake after oil extraction is used to fertilize soil, purify well water, and desalinate sea water (16341). Moringa has traditionally been used as an antiseptic and astringent and has been applied to the skin for various skin conditions.",

Tablets and capsules containing up to 30 grams of moringa leaf powder have been used daily with apparent safety in clinical studies lasting up to 6 months (20578, 90572, 90572, 97209, 97210). A dried moringa seed kernel powder has also been used with apparent safety in doses of 3 grams twice daily for 3 weeks (19278). ...when moringa leaf extract is used topically and appropriately. Moringa leaf extract 2% has been used 3 times daily with apparent safety in a clinical trial lasting 3 months (112640).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when moringa root or root bark are used orally. Moringa root contains spirochin, a potentially toxic alkaloid, while moringa root bark contains stimulant alkaloids similar to ephedrine. Although spirochin has not been studied in humans, animal data shows that it can cause nerve paralysis (63764).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when moringa leaf is used orally and appropriately, short-term. Powdered dried moringa leaf has been used with apparent safety in doses of 15 grams twice daily for up to 2 months (90576).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when the leaf is used orally during the second or third trimesters, short-term. Moringa leaf powder or extract 500 mg daily for up to 4 months has been used with apparent safety during the second and third trimesters (105469, 105471, 105472, 110645). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using moringa leaf by mouth during the first trimester.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when the root, bark, or flower are used orally. Traditionally, moringa root bark and gum from moringa trunk bark have been used to induce abortion. When taken orally along with black peppercorns to induce abortion, moringa root bark may cause fatality (63764).

However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Transient diarrhea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, a case of bilateral pulmonary embolism after a 5-month history of taking moringa leaf extract is reported in a 63-year-old female without other risks for venous thromboembolism. The patient recovered with standard anticoagulant treatment. Researchers speculate that possible procoagulant effects of moringa may have played a role in this event (110644).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been linked to the consumption of moringa leaves. A 53-year-old male presented with fever and generalized maculopapular rash 14 hours after eating food containing moringa leaves. Painful oral ulcers developed by the next day. The patient also reported a similar episode of oral ulcers after eating food containing moringa leaves three months earlier. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and omeprazole and recovered within two weeks. Researchers speculate that the immunomodulatory effects of moringa may have played a role in this reaction (99876). There are also cases of fixed food eruption to moringa. In one case, suspected fixed food eruption occurred on the trunk and face of a 60-year-old female, reoccurring 8 hours after self reintroduction (112641).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, moringa leaf powder can cause diarrhea.

It is unclear if oral moringa seed is beneficial in patients with asthma.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate asthma shows that taking powdered dried moringa seed kernels 3 grams twice daily for 3 weeks reduces the severity of asthma symptoms, including dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, and cough, and improves lung function when compared to baseline (19278). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf extract is beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in young, generally healthy adults shows that taking moringa leaf extract 1044 mg daily for 30 days increases the number of push-ups, but does not improve other measures of physical performance such as the number of pull-ups, hand grip strength, or sprint time, when compared with placebo (115743). This study was small and likely underpowered to detect statistically significant differences.\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral moringa, taken during the second or third trimester or while breastfeeding, can improve infant growth.\nAn observational follow-up of a large randomized clinical trial conducted in Indonesia during the second trimester or 1 month after giving birth shows that taking 500 mg moringa leaf powder or extract daily for 4 months does not reduce stunting in infants followed for up to 11 months when compared with an unspecified dose of iron and folate (105471, 105472). Other observational data, also from a large randomized clinical trial conducted in Indonesia, suggests the rate of stunted growth in children aged 36 to 42 months is 25% after taking 500 mg moringa leaf extract daily for 3 months during the third trimester, compared to 42% with 500 mg moringa leaf flour, or 33% with iron 60 mg and 0.2 mcg folic acid (110645). Researchers propose that differences in the nutritional content between moringa leaf extract and flour may account for the variation in results among forms.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf is beneficial in patients with diabetes; research is conflicting.\nA small clinical study in therapy-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking 4 grams of moringa leaf powder twice daily for 4 weeks does not affect fasting blood glucose (FBG) or postprandial glucose (PPG) when compared with placebo (105470). These findings are limited by the small size and short duration of the study. A non-randomized clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking a sulfonylurea shows that taking 2 tablets containing an unspecified amount of powdered moringa leaf in addition to following a calorie-restricted diet for 90 days does not reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with standard treatment, although it modestly reduces PPG when compared with baseline (90572). Another small non-randomized clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking hypoglycemic agents shows that taking powdered moringa leaf 8 grams daily for 40 days in addition to following a calorie-restricted diet reduces FBG, PPG, and lipid levels when compared with baseline (97208). It is unclear if any benefit identified in these studies is due to moringa or calorie restriction. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the control group.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf is beneficial in patients with HIV; research is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research in normal weight Congolese patients with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy shows that taking dried moringa leaf powder 10 grams three times daily with meals for 6 months increases body mass index (BMI) by 2 kg/m2 when compared with a nutritional counseling only group. However, there was no difference in immune function as measured by CD4 counts (97210). Results of other research are in conflict. A large clinical study in Nigerian adults treated with standard antivirals for HIV shows that taking moringa leaf powder 5 grams three times daily with meals for 6 months modestly increases CD4 counts but does not impact viral load or anthropometric parameters (i.e., weight, BMI) when compared with placebo. However, most patients were normal or overweight, and over half had an undetectable viral load at baseline (110648). Secondary analysis of this data suggests taking moringa may also improve quality of life (110649). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the inability to mask the taste of moringa leaf powder; patients may have been biased by knowing their study group assignment. Similarly, a small open label clinical study also in Nigerian adults treated with antiviral therapy for HIV shows that taking a moringa 200 mg capsule daily (Formula 10 Herbal Products, Nigeria) for 3 months modestly increases CD4 counts, lymphocyte and platelet counts, and hemoglobin when compared with antiviral therapy alone (110650).\n\nMoringa leaf has also been evaluated in combination therapy. A single-center clinical study in Uganda in adults with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy shows that taking moringa leaf power 10 grams in combination with Sweet Annie daily for 12 months modestly improves CD4 counts andviral load suppression when compared with placebo (116056). It is unclear if these benefits are due to moringa leaf, Sweet Annie, or the combination.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nOne small clinical study in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking atorvastatin 10 mg daily with powder of an unspecified part of the moringa plant 1 gram twice daily for 45 days modestly reduces levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides when compared with taking atorvastatin alone (112639). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking powdered moringa leaf 8 grams daily in addition to following a calorie restricted diet for 40 days modestly reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline (97208). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the control group, as well as small study size and short duration. In contrast, one small clinical study in patients of Indian descent with hyperlipidemia shows that taking 8 tablets of standardized dehydrated moringa drumstick leaf (DDL) 4.6 grams daily for 50 days has no effect on lipid levels when compared with baseline (97212).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral moringa leaf powder is beneficial for patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in treatment-naïve adults with prediabetes shows that taking moringa leaf powder 2400 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) but does not improve markers of insulin resistance or anthropometric measures (i.e. weight, BMI, waist circumference) when compared with placebo (110646).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf flour is beneficial for anemia during pregnancy.\nA small clinical study in pregnant patients with anemia in Indonesia shows that consuming biscuits enriched with 5.6 grams of moringa leaf flour, in addition to iron 500 mg, daily for 60 days increases hemoglobin by 1 g/dL, compared to 0.66 mg/dL with iron 500 mg daily alone. (110647). The validity of this study is limited by poor methodology, including lack of randomization and blinding.\nless\nLactation. Small clinical studies suggest that oral moringa leaf may modestly increase breastmilk volume during the first week of lactation.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials in breastfeeding patients shows that when started on postpartum day 3, moringa leaf increases breastmilk volume by about 120 mL per expression by day 7 when compared to control (90573). Studies included in the analysis used specific capsules containing moringa leaf (Natalac, Gruppo Medica Inc.) 250 mg twice daily on postpartum days 3-5 (20578), and specific capsules containing moringa leaf (Pro-Lacta, Pascual Laboratories, Inc.) 350 mg twice daily starting on postpartum day 3 and continuing for one week (90571). However, due to methodological limitations and the short duration of the included trials, the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.\nless\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf is beneficial for children with malnutrition.\nOne small clinical study in children with mild-to-moderate malnutrition shows that supplementing food with powdered dried moringa leaf 15 grams twice daily for 2 months results in 23 of 30 children having a 20% or greater improvement in weight, compared with only 2 of 30 children receiving no additional intervention (90576). It is unclear if maternal consumption of moringa leaves prevents malnutrition in infants. An observational follow-up of a large randomized clinical trial in Indonesian patients in their second trimester or one month postpartum shows that consuming four capsules, each containing 500 mg moringa leaf powder or extract, daily for 4 months might protect the infant against being underweight, but does not reduce stunting in infants followed for up to 11 months, when compared with an unspecified dose of iron and folate (105471, 105472).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf improves menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal patients shows that taking powdered moringa leaves 7 grams with food daily for 3 months modestly improves menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and sleeping problems when compared with no dietary additives (90575).\nless\nObesity. Oral moringa leaf has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a combination product containing moringa leaf extract 200 mg, green coffee bean extract 300 mg, banaba leaf extract 100 mg, and vitamin D3 500 IU (CraveCheck, Advocare International) daily for 2 months does not reduce body weight when compared with placebo. In fact, patients in the placebo group showed slightly greater weight loss than patients in the treatment group. However, taking the combination product appears to reduce fat mass and increase fat-free or lean mass as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, suggesting that the combination product might improve body composition (97211). It is not clear if this effect is due to moringa, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if topical moringa leaf improves oral leukoplakia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that topical application 3 times daily for 3 months with a gel providing moringa leaf extract 2% reduces lesion size by about 77% compared to baseline. Moringa gel is modestly more effective for reducing lesion size than a specific cream (Retino-A) (112640). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nVitamin A deficiency. It is unclear if oral moringa leaf is beneficial in infants deficient in vitamin A.\nPreliminary clinical research conducted in rural Ghana shows that vitamin A-deficient infants aged 8-12 months who receive cereal supplemented with moringa leaf powder for 6 weeks do not have a significant improvement in vitamin A status when compared with those given cereal without moringa (98455).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate moringa for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of moringa.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of moringa are the leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, and roots. Moringa leaves are a rich source of vitamins A and C, beta-carotene, calcium, iron, potassium, protein, and essential amino acids such as methionine, cystine, tryptophan, and lysine (16343, 16344). The fresh leaves have a total carotene content of 40 mg/100 grams, and retain 50% of this content when dried and stored for three months (16341). The ascorbic acid content of dried leaves is between 700-1400 mg per 100 grams (16343). The leaves also contain niazirin and niazirinin which are nitrile glycosides, beta-sitosterol and its glucopyranoside derivatives, glycerol-1-(9-octadecanoate), and mustard oil glycosides including 4-[(4'-0-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl] isothiocyanate, niaziminin A, and niaziminin B (16338, 16339, 16347). Other isothiocyanates and the related compound, niazimicin are also present (16338).\n\nThe essential oil contains zeatin, quercetin, beta-sitosterol, caffeoylquinic acid, pterygospermin, and kaempferol (16338). The leaves are also rich in antioxidant phenolic compounds such as quercetin and kaempferol.\n\nMoringa seeds contain 38% to 42% oil. The oil contains tocopherols, sterols, and fatty acids. The main sterols present are campesterol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, delta-5-avenasterol, and clerosterol. About 76% of the total fatty acid content is the mono-unsaturated oleic acid, with linoleic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic and behenic acids also present (16340). The residue of the seeds remaining after oil extraction has a protein content of 26% to 32% (16340). This residue and the seed kernels are able to remove contaminants, including lead, iron and cadmium, from drinking water (16340, 16349).\n\nMoringa root contains the alkaloids moringine, which is identical to benzylamine, and moringinine (16338, 16339). The fruit, also called the pod or drumstick, contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, fiber, vitamin A, carotene, nicotinic acid, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, estrogenic substances and beta-sitosterol (16342, 16345).\n\nMoringa flowers contain flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, rhamnetin, isoquercitrin, and kaempferitrin (16343).\nAnalgesic effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that moringa root and leaf extract have antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects (63679, 63775, 63776). This may explain why moringa has been used traditionally for chronic pain conditions, such as arthritis.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nMoringa has been used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous animal studies show that moringa reduces inflammation and edema (63652, 63658, 63774, 63775, 63776, 63781, 63783, 63785, 63792).\nAntiarsenic effects\nEvidence from in vitro and animal research shows that the seeds of moringa can prevent and reverse the effects of arsenic exposure (16349, 63683, 63719, 63731). It is thought that arsenic may be removed by binding to sulfhydryl-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine present in the protein-rich seeds. Also, antioxidants such as vitamins A, C and E, beta-carotene, beta-sitosterol, quercetin and kaempferol present in the seeds may protect against oxidative damage (16349).\nAntiasthmatic effects\nMoringa has been studied for use in asthma. In animal asthma models, moringa seed extract may decrease airway inflammation, acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction, and immune-mediated inflammatory response (63684, 63686, 63705, 63727, 63793).\nAntibacterial effects\nMoringa has antibacterial effects and has been used to treat bacteria in the water in efforts to make it potable. A substance called pterygospermin isolated from the root is reported to have antibacterial properties (16339, 16344, 63643, 63710). However, not all research is positive. While moringa seed has been shown to have short-term antibacterial activity against heterotrophic bacteria and fecal coliforms in water (63660, 63707, 63737), regrowth of some bacteria strains appears to occur in the supernant water within 24 hours of treatment (63737). Also, adding one crushed moringa seed per 5 liters of water does not reduce bacteria counts to make the water drinkable, especially when compared to chlorine (63714).\n\nIn vitro, moringa extracts inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, coliform bacteria, and other strains (63637, 63690, 63716, 63721, 63726, 63740, 63778, 63779).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSeveral animal studies suggest that moringa leaf can reduce blood glucose, although research in humans is conflicting (12249, 20571, 20573, 20574). This potential effect has been attributed to reduced intestinal glucose uptake and slower gastric emptying time due to moringa leaf fiber content (105470). One very small study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that eating a meal containing moringa leaves 50 grams modestly reduces postprandial glucose levels and reduces glycemic response by about 20% when compared with a standard meal without moringa (97207).\nAntifertility effects\nMoringa is reported to have estrogenic, antiestrogenic, progestational, anti-progestational, and contraceptive activities (16338, 63736, 63766). Studies in animals indicate that root extracts initially increase estrogenic effects and then inhibit them, possibly by binding to receptors and then blocking them (16338). Extracts of both the root and bark can cause intense uterine contractions and have been used as abortifacients (16338). Preliminary animal research shows that moringa root and bark can prevent implantation (63735, 63765), while leaf extract can result in abortion (63661).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that essential oil from moringa leaf and ethanol extract of moringa seed have antifungal activity against Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis (16350).\nAntineoplastic effects\nPreliminary research indicates that several of the leaf and seed constituents, such as niazimicin, have anticancer properties (16338, 16344, 16345, 33322, 63624, 63745). Applied topically, a fruit extract reduces the incidence and tumor burden of skin papillomas induced in animals (16345).\nAntioxidant effects\nMoringa contains anti-oxidant constituents such as quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, quercetin glucoside, kaempferol rhamnoglucoside, procyanidin, and vanillin (16343, 63693, 63697, 63698, 63715). In clinical research, moringa leaf extract reduced malonaldehyde and increased glutathione peroxidase (115743). In vitro studies indicate that leaf extracts can scavenge superoxide radicals, prevent peroxidation of lipid membranes, inhibit oxidation of rat hepatic microsomes, and inhibit peroxidation of linoleic acid and lipids (16343, 63633, 63680, 63704, 63787, 63794).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro moringa leaf extract significantly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and epinephrine (63763).\nAntispasmodic effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that moringa seeds inhibits chemically induced spasms of the duodenum by up to 67% (63652). This may explain the use of moringa as an antispasmodic agent.\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research in animals shows that moringa extract delays the development of skin lesions, prolongs mean survival times, and reduces mortality after infection with herpes simplex-1 virus (HSV-1) (63653).\nCardiovascular effects\nMoringa root contains the alkaloids moringine, which is identical to benzylamine, and moringinine (16338, 16339). Moringinine has cardiac stimulant, hypertensive, and other sympathomimetic effects (16338, 63752). The root can also cause hypotension, bradycardia, and both positive and negative inotropic effects in animals, while high doses can cause kidney and liver dysfunction (16338).\n\nCertain constituents of moringa leaf have shown hypotensive effects such as beta-sitosterol, nitrile glycosides, and mustard oil glycosides (16347, 20575, 63742). However, research in humans has not demonstrated significant hypotensive effects after consumption of moringa leaf 120 grams as a single dose or 8 grams daily for 4 weeks (103222, 105470).\nChelating effects\nMoringa has been used to clean water. Moringa seeds, husks, and pods have been shown to adsorb chromium, cadmium, and nickel (63667). Moringa seeds have been used as a biosorbent for removal of arsenic, cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, cobalt, chromium, and silver ions from aqueous solutions, including polluted water (63659, 63664, 63669, 63688, 63702, 63723, 63730, 63762).\nGalactagogue effects\nMoringa leaf has been used traditionally as a galactagogue (63756, 63757). Moringa leaf can increase maternal serum prolactin levels, which can increases milk production (63769, 63770).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal ulcer models such as aspirin-induced gastric ulcers and acetic acid-induced chronic gastric ulcers, moringa flower bud and leaf extracts decrease the ulcer index and increased healing (63678, 63741, 63784, 63785). The mechanism may involve modulation of 5-HT3 receptors on gastric tissue (63718).\nGenitourinary effects\nPreliminary data suggests an extract of moringa root has diuretic activity, and may help dissolve and prevent formation of kidney stones composed of oxalate, calcium, and phosphate (16339, 63652, 63786).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary animal data suggests that extracts of the stem bark leaf, and/or seed of moringa protect against carbon tetrachloride, rifampin, and acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity (63703, 63774, 63682).\nImmune effects\nAnimal models show that moringa seed extract reduces delayed hypersensitivity reactions, immediate hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylactic shock), and humoral antibody response (63687, 63713).\n\nIn an animal model of immunosuppression, moringa extract given alone or conjugated with chitosan nanoparticles enhances immune response as shown by increased total leukocyte count, increased complement C3 and C4 levels, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels compared with controls. The immune-enhancing effects were greater when moringa was conjugated with chitosan nanoparticles (116043).\nInsecticidal effects\nMoringa seed extract delays development and induces mortality of larva of yellow fever mosquito (63696, 63700).\nLipid effects\nPreliminary animal research suggests that a cooked and dried extract of moringa fruit can lower serum lipids by a similar amount to lovastatin, possibly due to its beta-sitosterol content (16342). Other animal research shows that moringa leaf extract can lower cholesterol levels and atherosclerotic plaque formation comparably to simvastatin or pravastatin (63680, 63717). Additional preliminary research shows that moringa leaf extract can lower serum cholesterol levels in animal models fed a high-fat diet (16346, 63629).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nMoringa may have neuroprotective effects. Preliminary animal research suggests that moringa root extract inhibits penicillin-induced seizure by altering levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in different regions of the brain (63656).\nOcular effects\nPreliminary data from animals suggest that moringa leaf extract prevents experimentally induced cataracts. This effect is attributed to the antioxidant activity of moringa (63725).\nSunscreen effects\nPreliminary data from an in vitro study suggest that extracts of moringa leaves can absorb ultraviolet light. Aqueous, methanolic, and alcoholic extracts in concentrations of 2% to 4% had a sun protection factor (SPF) around 2 (98454).\nThyroid effects\nMoringa leaf extract may have anti-thyroid effects. A study in animal models reported reduced serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels and increased thyroxine (T4) levels, suggesting reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (16348).\nWound healing effects\nPreliminary data from animal research suggest that extracts from moringa leaf, pulp, and seed increase the rate of wound healing, increase strength of new skin, and decrease scar area. While the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it is thought that moringa may improve wound healing due to its antibacterial activity or its zinc content (63671)."

It is native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Korea, India, Thailand, and Malaysia (94207).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBleeding. Intramuscular motherwort injections, alone or in combination with standard treatment such as oxytocin, might reduce volume of blood loss and duration of bleeding after vaginal delivery, caesarian section, or induced abortion.\nIn females with postpartum bleeding after vaginal birth, most research shows that adding motherwort injection to oxytocin or carboprost treatment is more effective than those treatments alone. A meta-analysis of 29 low quality trials shows that injection with motherwort 40-140 mg, in addition to varying doses of oxytocin, is more effective than oxytocin alone for reducing blood loss after vaginal delivery (101890). This combination reduces the mean blood loss within 2 and 24 hours of delivery by 55 mL and 85 mL, respectively. Also, the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, defined as an estimated blood loss of at least 400 mL within 2 hours or at least 500 mL within 24 hours, is reduced by 71%, based on meta-analysis of 18 trials. Meta-analysis of 8 trials also shows motherwort alone to be more effective than oxytocin for reducing blood loss within 24 hours of delivery, but not within 2 hours of delivery. Meta-analysis of 4 trials shows that motherwort 40-200 mg is as effective as oxytocin for reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (101890). Studies were all very low to low quality, with moderate to high risk of bias, and conducted in China, the latter of which limits generalizability to other geographic regions.\n\nIn females with post-caesarian bleeding, adding motherwort injection to oxytocin reduces blood loss and the rate of post-partum hemorrhage when compared with using oxytocin alone. In a large clinical trial, motherwort 40 mg was injected into the uterus during the caesarian section, followed by 20 mg intramuscular injections every 12 hours over the next 36 hours. However, motherwort injection into the uterus does not seem to be more effective than oxytocin for reducing bleeding during the caesarian section (94203). However, a meta-analysis of 8 trials shows that prophylactic injection with motherwort 60-200 mg, in addition to carboprost 250 mcg, reduces the mean blood loss within 2 and 24 hours of delivery by 127 mL and 147 mL, respectively, with a 72% decrease in the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage over carboprost alone (101891). In 7 of the 8 trials the mode of delivery was caesarian section and 1 was a vaginal delivery.\n\nA large observational study suggests that intramuscular injection of motherwort into the uterus combined with intravenous oxytocin is associated with a lower risk of post-partum hemorrhage after caesarian section when compared with intravenous oxytocin plus intramuscular injection of oxytocin into the uterus (112291).\n\nA meta-analysis of 9 clinical trials among patients undergoing induced abortion shows that motherwort injection combined with oxytocin lowers the volume of blood loss both 2 hours and 24 hours after the procedure when compared with oxytocin alone (112292). However, motherwort alone is not more effective than oxytocin for blood loss post-abortion. Meta-analysis indicates that motherwort injected alone or with oxytocin reduces the duration of blood loss compared with oxytocin or no treatment.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of motherwort are the above ground parts. Motherwort contains alkaloids (principally leonurine and stachydrine, with smaller amounts of leonurinine and leonuridine), flavonoids (hyperoside, quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, epicatechin), sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, phenylpropanoid glycosides, beta-caryophylline, polysaccharides, and essential oils (94205, 94206, 94207, 94208).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells, which are an in vitro model of inflammation, the essential oil from motherwort roots decreased levels of the inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma (94204). Additionally, in human research, motherwort extract in combination with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum decreased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (115049).\nAnticancer effects\nExtracts of the above-ground parts of motherwort are reported to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines in vitro (63800). An ethanol extract of the above-ground parts of motherwort causes non-apoptotic death of both estrogen receptor positive and negative human breast cancer cells in vitro (63813). The essential oil from motherwort roots has activity in vitro against grade IV glioma cells (94204).\nAntimicrobial effects\nExtracts from both the aerial parts and roots of motherwort have shown in vitro activity against bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi), protozoa (Plasmodium falciparum), fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and yeasts (Debaryomyces hansenii) (94204, 94205, 94206).\nAntioxidant effects\nExtracts of motherwort above-ground parts are reported to have antioxidant activity in vitro (63816). The extracts also have protective effects in animal models of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and renal ischemic injury (94207, 94208). The mechanism of these effects is thought to involve scavenging of oxygen free radicals, reduced lipid peroxidation, increased activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and reduced intracellular content of nitric oxide (94207, 94208). Furthermore, human research suggests that an extract from motherwort, in combination with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, increases total antioxidant status (115049).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn humans, giving an intravenous infusion of motherwort daily for 15 days decreases blood viscosity, fibrinogen volume, and platelet aggregation (1533). It is not known if these effects occur when motherwort is taken orally.\nAntiviral effects\nA motherwort extract inactivates tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in cell cultures, and increases survival rate and longevity in mice infected with TBE virus (63810).\nDiuretic effects\nMotherwort is reported to have potassium-sparing diuretic activity, possibly mediated by the alkaloid stachydrine (63829, 94207).\nUterine effects\nIn animal studies, the alkaloid leonurine isolated from motherwort has uterotonic effects, increasing the frequency and intensity of uterine muscle contractions (94205, 94207, 94208). This may lead to induction of labor and reduction in post-partum hemorrhage. In other animal studies, an extract of motherwort reduced uterine spasms induced by prostaglandins, giving it a possible role in the treatment of dysmenorrhea (94207)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of mountain ash are the berries, leaves, and flowers. The berries can be used fresh, dried, or cooked and then dried. Mountain ash berry contains parasorbic acid, cyanogenic glycosides, fruit acids (malic acid, tartaric acid), tannins, and vitamin C (18). Parasorbic acid can cause local irritation, but it is partially degraded by drying and completely destroyed by cooking (2). The berries also contain many phenolic compounds including caffeic and ferulic acid pseudodepsides (predominantly isomers of chlorogenic acid and cynarin), flavonols (mostly quercetin glycosides), flavan-3-ol derivatives, including proanthocyanidin oligomers and polymers, caffeoylquinic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and simple phenolic acids (110423, 110424).\n\nThe flowers of mountain ash contain numerous constituents, including flavonoids such as quercetin and kaempferol and flavanols such as catechins and proanthocyanidins (99894).\nAnti-gout effects\nWhile mountain ash has been traditionally used for gout, some in vitro research shows that mountain ash flower extracts don't seem to inhibit xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme in the conversion of xanthine to uric acid (99894). It is unknown whether mountain ash exerts anti-gout effects through other mechanisms.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that mountain ash flower extracts have anti-inflammatory properties, possibly through inhibition of lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase (99894).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that mountain ash flower extracts have antioxidant effects (99894). In vitro research shows that berry extracts neutralize multiple oxidants generated in vivo, increase the non-enzyme antioxidant capacity of human plasma, and protect plasma proteins and lipids from oxidative or nitrative damage (110424). These extracts also protect human fibrinogen from structural damage caused by reactive oxygen species (110423).\nDietary effects\nIn vitro research shows that berry extracts inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase enzymes, involved in digestion of complex carbohydrates (110424).\nHematologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that extracts of mountain ash berries, and polyphenols isolated from them, reduce structural changes to fibrinogen, and reduce formation of high molecular weight fibrinogen protein aggregates which have prothrombotic activity. This is the result of reduced nitration of tyrosine residues in fibrinogen, reducing polymerization rates. The enzymatic activity of thrombin is decreased by mountain ash berry extracts, leading to reduced conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which could help prevent thromboembolic complications (110423).\n\nBerry extracts also inhibit hyaluronidase activity, reducing disruption of blood vessel endothelium, and reducing activation of platelets and the plasma coagulation proteins that lead to fibrin clot formation. The extracts do not affect activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or prothrombin time (PT) (110423)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of mullein are the flower, leaf, and root (92841).\n\nThe flowers of mullein contain iridoid glycosides such as aucubin, harpagide, and harpagoside, flavonoids including kaempferol, hesperidin, verbascoside, apigenin, quercetin and rutin, phenylethanoid glycosides such as verbascoside, triterpene saponins including thapsuines, polysaccharides, phenolic acids, phytosterol glycosides and digiprolactone. Polyphenolcarboxylic acids, with large concentrations of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and rosmarinic acid are also present (12703, 59405, 63943, 63944, 63945, 92840, 92841, 107875). Mullein also contains tannins, alkaloids, steroids, volatile oils, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (92841, 107873, 107875).\nAnthelmintic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that an aqueous methanolic extract of the aerial parts of mullein can induce paralysis in adult roundworms (Ascaridia galli) and tapeworms (Raillietina spiralis), comparable to albendazole. Paralysis occurred faster with higher concentrations of the extract (92841).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory research suggests that a mullein flower extract exhibits dose-dependent free radical scavenging activity, likely related to the polyphenol content, and also related to the caffeic, ferulic, and rosmarinic acids, and quercetin and apigenin. It also inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced intracellular adhesion molecule 1 at higher concentrations. However, in animals with acute inflammation of the paw induced by egg-white, giving the flower extract orally is ineffective. It is suggested that extracts need to contain higher concentrations of verbascoside, aucubin, and phenylethanoids to show anti-inflammatory effects (92840).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that various mullein species exhibit activity against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli (12703, 63942).\nAntioxidant effects\nConstituents of mullein, including verbascoside, quercetin, apigenin, and caffeic, ferulic, and rosmarinic acids, are thought to have antioxidant activity (63941, 92841).\nAntispasmodic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that an aqueous methanolic extract of the aerial parts of mullein produces a concentration dependent relaxation of spontaneous contractions in dissected jejunum. This is possibly mediated through actions on voltage sensitive L-type calcium channels (92841).\nAntitumor effects\nLaboratory research suggests that a saponin glycoside isolated from mullein flowers directly inactivates ribosomes, which may be beneficial in inhibiting protein synthesis in tumor cells (59405).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that mullein exhibits activity against Herpes simplex type 1 virus (1534, 12702, 63934, 63943).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nMusk used for medicine is the dried form of a secretion obtained from male musk deer (95932). The primary constituent thought to be responsible for the odor of musk is muscone (6). Musk also contains cholesterol, peptides, lipids, estrogens, progesterone, and significant quantities of testosterone and other anabolic-androgenic steroids. These include androsterone, etiocholanolone, several androstanediols and androstanediones, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), epiandrosterone, and epitestosterone (95932, 95933). Quantities of steroids present depend on the musk source and the animals diet. Dried musk is reported to contain between 1 mg and 8 mg of total androgens per gram (95933).\nAnabolic-androgenic effects\nThe quantities of androgens present in musk are likely sufficient to produce anabolic and androgenic effects in humans. There are anecdotal reports of increased exercise tolerance after taking musk 100-200 mg once daily for 3 days (95933). After using a traditional Chinese medicine product containing musk, athletes have tested positive for banned exogenous steroids under international anti-doping rules (95932)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of myrrh.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of myrrh is the resin that exudes from cuts in the bark. Myrrh consists of around 30% to 61% gum, 23% to 40% alcohol-soluble resin, 2% to 17% volatile essential oils, and 10% to 25% bitter principles (93646, 93651, 93654). The volatile oil contains steroids, sterols, and terpenes. Furanodiene sesquiterpenes are responsible for the characteristic aroma of myrrh and include curzerine, furanoeudesma-1,3-diene, and lindestrine (93654, 98224).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal and preliminary human research suggests that myrrh has analgesic effects (93657, 93659, 98224). This activity is attributed to the furanodiene sesquiterpenes constituents, including curzerine, furanoeudesma-1,3-diene, and lindestrine (98224). Myrrh also seems to have some local anesthetic properties (93658).\nAnthelmintic effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that myrrh has anthelmintic effects against Eimeria stiedae, Fasciola gigantica, Giardia lamblia, and Schistosoma mansoni. Myrrh volatile oil appears to have more anthelmintic activity than a specific oleoresin extract of myrrh (Mirazid, Pharco Pharmaceuticals) (93654, 93655).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome animal and in vitro research suggests that myrrh has anti-inflammatory effects (4, 8, 93657, 93659). These effects may be explained by inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis in activated neutrophils (93653).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that myrrh might have anticancer effects (1536). Compared to frankincense, essential oil from myrrh showed higher anticancer activity in vitro. Breast cancer (MCF-7) and skin cancer (HS-1) cell lines were the most sensitive to myrrh essential oil, with concentration-dependent apoptosis observed in MCF-7 cells (93651).\nAntidiabetic effects\nMyrrh might have hypoglycemic effects (4). Ex vivo research in mouse and human islet cells shows that myrrh resin increases basal insulin secretion and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (104841).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that myrrh has antibacterial and antifungal activity (4, 6, 93658). Sesquiterpenes from myrrh have been shown to have activity against Escerichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans (93658).\nAstringent effects\nMyrrh might have astringent effects (4, 6).\nCognitive effects\nSome preliminary animal research suggests that myrrh might improve memory impairment. In mice with scopolamine-induced memory impairment, oral administration of myrrh resin extract for 7 days reversed the effects of scopolamine on certain memory-related tasks. Researchers suggest that the memory-enhancing effects of myrrh may be due to activation of Akt and ERK in the hippocampus (93646).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome animal research suggests that myrrh protects against the development of gastric ulcers (1535).\nLipid effects\nSome animal research suggests that myrrh might have anti-hyperlipidemic activity (93657).\nStimulant effects\nMyrrh can stimulate smooth muscle (6, 12) and possibly peristalsis (6). It stimulates uterine tone (6, 12) and promotes uterine blood flow (12, 19)."

It is unclear if topical myrtle is beneficial in patients with acne.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults and adolescents with mild to moderate acne shows that applying myrtle leaf extract topically to the face twice daily for 16 weeks reduces facial lesion count and acne severity scores by 23% to 45% when compared to baseline. Improvements were similar to clindamycin 1% topical solution (106777). Also, a small, single-blind trial in females whose mild-to-moderate acne resolved after receiving conventional acne therapy shows that applying a lotion containing myrtle extract and azelaic acid twice daily for 16 weeks reduces the risk of acne relapse, decreases the number of acne lesions, and improves post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation when compared with a placebo cream (111733). It is unclear if these effects are to myrtle, azelaic acid, or the combination.\nless\nBacterial vaginosis.

It is unclear if topical myrtle is beneficial in patients with canker sores.\nA small clinical study in patients with recurring canker sores shows that applying a paste containing myrtle leaf extract 5% to canker sores four times daily for 6 days decreases ulcer size, pain, and redness when compared with placebo (98643).\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral myrtle for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of myrtle for this purpose.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral myrtle is beneficial in patients with GERD.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with GERD shows that taking myrtle berry or myrtle berry extract 1000 mg orally daily for 4 weeks improves GERD symptom scores and frequency when compared with baseline. The improvements were similar to taking omeprazole 20 mg daily. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (98641). Preliminary clinical research in children 1-7 years of age with GERD shows that taking myrtle berry extract syrup 0.21 mL/kg orally three times daily and with meals along with omeprazole 1 mg/kg daily orally for 8 weeks does not reduce GERD scores or symptoms, including vomiting and regurgitation, when compared with taking placebo along with omeprazole. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. (106781).\nless\nGingivitis.

Information on the specific plant parts used for each species was lacking. Further, it is unclear if these findings are due to myrtle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV).

The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (98642). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with menorrhagia shows that taking myrtle berry powder 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 days during menses for 2 cycles improves blood loss assessment scores by 58% and hemoglobin levels by 17% when compared to baseline. Improvements were similar to tranexamic acid 500 mg twice daily.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of myrtle are the fruit, leaf, and branch. Myrtle contains a volatile oil containing terpenes, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids, tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and acylphloroglucinols (18, 98641, 98644). The berries also contain phenols, such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, and flavonols (98642, 106780). The volatile oil contains between 15% to 45% of 1,8-cineole, a constituent responsible for toxicity when taken in high doses (18). Myrtle leaf essential oil primarily contains eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, myrtenyl acetate, and d-limonene (109013).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that taking myrtle berry extract 0.25-1 gram/kg orally daily for 14 days reduces body weight and fasting blood glucose levels when compared with control. Treatment with myrtle berry extract also improved liver function tests (109014).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTaking syrup made from myrtle berries might help to reduce bleeding in those with heavy menstrual bleeding. This might be due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the berry tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, including the inhibition of prostaglandin activity (98642).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe constituent myrtol might have fungicidal, disinfectant, and antibacterial properties (18).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that taking myrtle berry extract 0.25-1 gram/kg orally daily for 14 days improves levels of oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde, when compared with control (109014). Animal research in healthy rats also shows that consuming myrtle leaf essential oil 1 mcL/gram orally daily for 14 days improves organ and tissue levels of these same markers (109013).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using myrtle leaf extract for acne. Preliminary clinical research in adults and adolescents with mild to moderate acne shows that applying myrtle leaf extract topically to the face twice daily for 16 weeks reduces levels of sebum in the stratum corneum (106777). In vitro research also suggests that myrtle may improve acne due to its antimicrobial properties and potential to inhibit Cutibacterium acnes biofilm formation in pilosebaceous follicles. Such biofilm formation may increase the virulence of C. acnes and the risk of antibiotic resistance (111733).\nGastrointestinal effects\nMyrtol, a constituent of myrtle, is purported to stimulate mucous membranes of the stomach; however, this has not been validated in laboratory or clinical research (18). Animal research in healthy rats shows that consuming myrtle leaf essential oil 1 mcL/gram orally daily for 14 days reduces fecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium colonies and increases Enterobacteriaceae colonies when compared with control. Taking myrtle leaf essential oil also increased fecal levels of alpha-glucuronidase and beta-galactoside (109013).\nLipid-lowering effects\nAnimal research in healthy rats shows that consuming myrtle leaf essential oil 1 mcL/gram orally daily for 14 days reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with control (109013).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that topically applying a myrtle berry extract gel 6% once daily for 21 days improves wound healing rates when compared with control. In contrast, rats without chemically-induced diabetes did not demonstrate improved wound healing rates with myrtle berry extract gel (106780)."
