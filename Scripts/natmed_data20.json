            "Overview": "Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic species of yeast (92807, 92808). It is used in some food processes that require fermentation (92808). It is also commonly used in probiotic supplements (92807). Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefit (90605). Although S. boulardii was previously identified as a unique species of yeast, it is now classified as a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1227, 1251, 1282, 7353).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using Saccharomyces boulardii for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, Saccharomyces boulardii is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately for up to 15 months (155, 4347, 4350, 4351, 4352, 4353, 4354, 7140, 7646, 7652),(12763, 14334, 14379, 14380, 14381, 72194, 72198).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages (4347, 4356, 14334, 72145, 92806, 98734, 103451, 107603, 107605, 111102)(111103). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Saccharomyces boulardii in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Saccharomyces boulardii is generally well tolerated.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that Saccharomyces boulardii may cause fungemia in certain patients.\nGastrointestinal\nRarely, oral use of Saccharomyces boulardii has caused gastrointestinal complaints, such as abdominal cramps, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite (98731, 107608).\nless\nImmunologic\nRarely, oral use of Saccharomyces boulardii has been associated with fungemia in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients (1247, 4357, 4358, 4360, 7329, 14459, 72121, 72126, 72142, 92809, 95357, 95363)(96277, 105171, 107604, 107607). Numerous cases of Saccharomyces fungemia have been reported in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients, particularly those with indwelling or central venous catheters, those receiving enteral feeding, or those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Most infections occurred when packets of Saccharomyces were used or when Saccharomyces capsules were opened at the bedside (12776, 12777, 14459, 95358, 95360, 95362, 95363, 105171). Admission to the ICU and extended length of stay increase the risk of developing Saccharomyces fungemia (107604). In a hospitalized 1-year-old patient with severe malnutrition and multiple invasive devices, Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia developed 2 days after receiving a probiotic containing S. boulardii 200 mg twice daily for 4 days (96277). In addition, there are two case reports of S. cerevisiae fungemia in hospitalized and intubated older patients with COVID-19 who had been given S. boulardii for diarrhea (105171).\n\nThe true incidence of fungemia is difficult to determine with S. boulardii. Most clinical laboratories are unable to differentiate between S. boulardii and S. cerevisiae, which might come from other sources (7353). In two case reports of patients in the ICU, there was a 100% alignment of fungal ribosomal DNA ITS sequences between the strains found in the blood of the infected patients and the strains of S. boulardii that had been administered (105171). In a large analysis of hospitalized patients, the incidence rate of Saccharomyces fungemia was 0.11% of those given S. boulardii and did not occur in patients not given this probiotic. Packets or capsules opened at a distance from the patient in the hospital were included in this analysis (107604).\n\nPositive Saccharomyces cultures have also been obtained rarely from other sites, such as the abdominal region and the oral or respiratory tract (107607).\n\nAn elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate may occur when S. boulardii is used to treat Crohn disease (7646), but this effect may be a natural part of the disease process.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDiarrhea. In children, oral Saccharomyces boulardii reduces the duration of acute diarrhea and the duration of hospitalization for acute diarrhea when taken alone or in combination with zinc. It is unclear if it is beneficial for chronic diarrhea in children or for diarrhea in adults.\nMost clinical research shows that S. boulardii reduces the duration of acute diarrhea in children by about one day (92815, 102422, 103454, 107636, 111103). Diarrhea caused by rotaviruses or nonspecific causes was reduced by about 18 and 22 hours, respectively (92815). In regions where malnourishment or zinc deficiency is common, zinc is often given alongside oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as part of standard treatment. Individual clinical studies in infants and children with acute diarrhea show that giving S. boulardii (LesunBerry Sundyota Numandis) 150-250 mg once or twice daily, or 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, for 5 days reduces the duration of diarrhea and the time to first semi-solid stool by about 12-29.5 hours when compared with ORT and possibly zinc (72147, 95412, 98397, 98729, 103451). In one clinical trial, approximately 83% of children adding S. boulardii to standard treatment with ORT and zinc were considered as recovered after 3 days, compared with 16% of children taking placebo with standard treatment (103451). Also, a meta-analysis shows with high certainty that taking a combination of S. boulardii and zinc reduces the duration of diarrhea in children by about 39 hours. This is 21 to 23 hours faster than either product taken alone (103454). Other clinical research in infants and children aged 6-24 months with persistent diarrhea shows that giving S. boulardii 1750 billion to 175 trillion CFUs twice daily for 5 days reduces the number of stools and the duration of diarrhea (72132). Other clinical research in young children with acute diarrhea shows that taking S. boulardii CNCM-I 3799 5 billion CFUs in combination with Bacillus subtilis CU-1 1 billion CFUs (Swiss Garnier Biotech) daily for 5 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by about 5.3 hours when compared with placebo. When administration is started within 24 or 48 hours of diarrhea onset, the combination product reduced diarrhea duration by 25.2 hours and 13.8 hours, respectively (107605).\n\nS. boulardii might also be beneficial for chronic diarrhea of various etiologies. In children receiving routine treatment for diarrhea lasting for at least 2 weeks, preliminary clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii for 14 days was effective in 91% of children, compared with 68% of those given only routine treatment. Efficacy was defined as having 1-2 stools daily or normal stool characteristics. The time to recovery was also reduced by approximately 35 hours; however, this was about 11 hours longer than those given probiotics containing an unknown mixture of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and enterococcus. S. boulardii 0.25 grams daily was used in children under three years of age; older children took this dose twice daily (107603).\n\nIn hospitalized children with acute diarrhea, taking S. boulardii seems to reduce hospital length of stay by around 20-22 hours when compared with control (102422, 111103). Also, a small clinical study in critically ill adults shows that administering S. boulardii 500 mg four times daily in tube feedings for 21 days or until enteral feedings were stopped reduces the occurrence of diarrhea when compared with placebo (4349). However, one clinical study in otherwise healthy adults in Mexico and India, taking loperamide 2 mg with simethicone 125 mg up to 8 times over 2 days was more effective for reducing diarrhea than taking S. boulardii 250 mg twice daily for 5 days (98400).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Saccharomyces boulardii seems to be beneficial for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in most patients.\nMost clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii orally can help prevent AAD in adults and children (4350, 4353, 4355, 8511, 14334, 14381, 72198, 72138, 72145, 72190)(72198, 90263, 90299) and decrease the risk of AAD by 37% to 63% (14334, 14458, 90263, 90299, 92813, 94692, 95348, 107635). For every 9-13 patients treated, one fewer will develop AAD (14334, 14458, 92813, 94692, 95348). In children, S. boulardii 250 mg once or twice daily (equivalent to about 5-10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) during antibiotic treatment was used (72145, 92813, 94692). In adults, S. boulardii 250-500 mg taken 2-4 times a day, usually not to exceed 1000 mg daily, has been most commonly used during antibiotic treatment (4353, 4355, 14334, 14381, 90263, 92813, 95348).\n\nHowever, not all research agrees. A large clinical study in adults shows that taking a specific S. boulardii product (Perenterol forte) 250 mg twice daily, starting on the same day as initiation of systemic antibiotics and continuing for 7 days after stopping antibiotics, does not reduce the occurrence of AAD when compared with placebo (98730). Another clinical study in elderly patients shows that taking S. boulardii 5 billion CFUs twice daily, starting within 48 hours of antibiotic treatment and continuing for 7 days after stopping antibiotics, does not reduce the incidence of AAD when compared with placebo (95361). These negative findings might be related to the age and clinical status of the included patients.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Saccharomyces boulardii seems to be beneficial for reducing adverse effects associated with standard therapy for H. pylori eradication. It is unclear if it is beneficial for increasing eradication rates.\nMeta-analyses of up to 17 clinical studies in adults and children with H. pylori infection show that taking S. boulardii 100-1000 mg daily for 1-4 weeks along with standard H. pylori eradication therapy increases eradication rates by 9% to 11% when compared to standard treatment with placebo (92814, 102423). For every 12 patients treated with adjunct S. boulardii and standard treatment, one additional patient will have successful eradication when compared to using standard treatment alone (92814). However, most trials have been conducted in patients on standard triple therapy. Several more recent clinical trials show that taking S. boulardii 250-500 mg twice daily does not increase the eradication rate of 14-day quadruple therapy when compared with placebo (107606, 110570, 111101). Another recent clinical study shows that taking S. boulardii 30 million colony forming units (CFUs) 3 times daily for 4 weeks in combination with clarithromycin-based triple therapy does not increase H. pylori eradication rate when compared with triple therapy alone (108138).\n\nThe role of S. boulardii monotherapy in patients failing standard H. pylori eradication therapy has also been evaluated. A small clinical study in Chinese adults who required rescue therapy after failing to respond to standard therapy shows that taking S. boulardii 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks increases the rate of H. pylori eradication 14-fold when compared with no treatment. For every 4 patients treated, 1 more had eradication when compared with no treatment. However, in patients that did not respond to S. boulardii rescue therapy, adding S. boulardii to standard therapy did not further increase the rate of H. pylori eradication when compared with standard therapy alone (110569).\n\nClinical research also shows that S. boulardii may reduce the adverse effects of H. pylori eradication therapy (12763, 72161, 102421, 107606, 111101). Adding S. boulardii 100-1000 mg daily for 1-4 weeks to H. pylori eradication therapy reduces the risk of treatment-related diarrhea and nausea by up to 67% and 40%, respectively, when compared with placebo or no treatment (92814, 102423, 107606). The reduced adverse effects might have contributed to the 67% reduction in discontinuation of standard treatment in patients using adjunct S. boulardii in five of the clinical studies that measures this outcome (102423).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral Saccharomyces boulardii seems to reduce the risk of NEC in hospitalized preterm infants. However, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies.\nAlthough two older meta-analyses show that giving S. boulardii to preterm infants during the first week of life does not reduce the risk of NEC or all-cause mortality (95344, 95351), a more recent meta-analysis of 10 moderate-quality clinical trials shows benefit. S. boulardii, usually 100-200 mg/kg daily, starting within the first week after birth and continuing throughout hospitalization, reduced the risk of NEC by 44% when compared with placebo or no treatment. There were also reductions in feeding intolerance and the number of days in the hospital, but no effect on sepsis or mortality (103452). Despite these findings, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, Saccharomyces boulardii is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. In children, oral Saccharomyces boulardii seems to reduce the duration of rotaviral diarrhea.\nClinical studies in children ages 3 months to 5 years with acute rotaviral diarrhea show that giving S. boulardii 200-250 mg twice daily for 5 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by about 1 day and reduces the risk of still having diarrhea 3 days after beginning the intervention by about 55% (95335, 95391). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that giving S. boulardii to infants and children with acute rotaviral diarrhea reduces the duration of diarrhea by about 18 hours (92815). However, giving S. boulardii does not seem to reduce fever or vomiting, the need for parenteral rehydration, or the number of patients who experience diarrhea for more than 7 days (95335).\nless\nTravelers' diarrhea. Most research suggests that oral Saccharomyces boulardii can help to reduce the risk of traveler's diarrhea.\nA meta-analysis which included four large clinical studies evaluating the use of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 500-1000 mg daily for 1-3 weeks in adults traveling to different parts of the world found a 21% reduction in relative risk of travelers' diarrhea when compared with placebo (101445). Also, some early research shows that taking S. boulardii 250-1000 mg daily orally for 1 month seems to help prevent travelers' diarrhea (155, 72183).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Oral Saccharomyces boulardii seems to be beneficial for preventing C. difficile infection. In combination with vancomycin or metronidazole, oral S. boulardii seems to be beneficial for preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection.\nAmong patients treated for C. difficile infection, about 6% to 25% experience at least one recurrent episode (95390). Taking S. boulardii 500 mg twice daily (equivalent to 20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily) orally, in combination with vancomycin or metronidazole, reduces the risk of C. difficile diarrhea recurrence in adults with a history of recurrence (4352, 4354, 14334, 72194).\n\nS. boulardii has also been evaluated for preventing a first occurrence of C. difficile diarrhea due to antibiotic use. Most results shows that taking S. boulardii 10-30 billion CFUs daily orally, in conjunction with antibiotics, can reduce the risk of developing C. difficile diarrhea by 53% to 61% in adults and children (14334, 18088, 72145, 95364, 95370). However, a meta-analysis of available clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii reduces the risk of C. difficile diarrhea by 75% in children, but does not reduce this risk in adults (92813). Observational research in acutely hospitalized elderly patients found that taking S. boulardii during antibiotic treatment is associated with a 58% reduced rate of C. difficile infection (98398). In contrast, a retrospective observational study in hospitalized elderly patients found no difference in C. difficile infection rates between patients receiving S. boulardii 250 mg twice daily along with broad spectrum antibiotics and those receiving broad spectrum antibiotics alone (98731). Due to this conflicting evidence, the current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) do not make a recommendation for the use of probiotics, including S. boulardii, for the primary prevention of C. difficile infection (107538).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nSepsis. In preterm infants, oral Saccharomyces boulardii does not seem to be beneficial for sepsis prevention.\nA meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials shows that giving preterm infants S. boulardii, usually 100-200 mg/kg daily, does not reduce the risk of sepsis when compared with placebo or no treatment (103452).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for acne.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific strain of S. boulardii called CBS 5926 (Perenterol, Cell Tech Pharma) daily for 5 months results in a subjective improvement in 80% of patients, compared with only 26% of those in the placebo group (7140).\nless\nCholera. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for cholera.\nA small clinical study in patients with cholera shows that taking S. boulardii 250 mg, alone or in combination with bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg every 6 hours, does not reduce cholera symptoms when compared with bismuth subsalicylate alone or with placebo (98733). However, this study might not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for cognitive function.\nIn healthy medical students, taking S. boulardii CNCM I-1079 (LacidoEnter, Institut Rosell) 5 billion colon-forming units daily for 30 days does not improve exam performance or reduce stress related to the exam when compared with placebo (103450).\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial in children with constipation.\nA moderately sized open-label clinical study in children aged 6 months to 12 years with functional constipation shows that taking S. boulardii 500-750 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces the rate of treatment success, defined as 3 or more bowel movements per week without incontinence, by 69% and 81% when compared with lactulose alone or lactulose and S. boulardii combination therapy, respectively. While no differences in stool frequency, stool consistency, incontinence frequency, or painful defecations were reported, more children taking S. boulardii discontinued the study and/or required a change in treatment during the study period (111102).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for reducing complications in critically ill, hospitalized patients.\nA small clinical study in critically ill patients shows that administering S. boulardii 500 mg four times daily in tube feedings for 21 days or until enteral feedings were stopped reduces the occurrence of diarrhea when compared with placebo (4349). Also, clinical research in multi-trauma patients requiring ventilation shows that taking a combination probiotic containing S. boulardii for 15 days modestly reduces the risk of sepsis, as well as the length of stay in the ICU and hospital, when compared with placebo. The combination product was taken twice daily and contained S. boulardii 1.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion CFUs, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 500 million CFUs, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 1.75 billion CFUs. Half of the dose was given into the oropharynx and half via a nasogastric tube (107524).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii 250 mg three times daily for up to 9 weeks reduces the frequency of bowel movements in patients with Crohn disease (7646). One preliminary clinical study shows that patients with Crohn disease in remission who take S. boulardii 1 gram daily combined with mesalamine (5-aminosalycilic acid, 5-ASA) 1 gram twice daily have a lower rate of relapse when compared with patients who take only mesalamine 1 gram three times daily after 6 months of treatment (14379). However, other clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii 1 gram daily for 1 year after achieving remission with steroids or salicylates does not increase the time to relapse or decrease symptom severity in patients with non-severe Crohn disease (92807). Possible reasons for the discrepancies include concomitant use of salicylates, severity of Crohn disease, and duration of treatment.\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for cystic fibrosis.\nTaking a specific strain of S. boulardii (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen CBS 5926) 250 mg three times daily orally for 21 days does not seem to decrease Candida albicans gastrointestinal colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis (7652).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral Saccharomyces boulardii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn rugby players, preliminary clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii (SBFloractiv, Bioceuticals) 250 mg for 9 weeks of international competition reduces muscle soreness and leg heaviness by a small amount more than placebo (103453). This was part of a 17-week study involving a multi-ingredient probiotic product (Ultrabiotic 60, Bioceuticals) providing 60 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococci. When S. boulardii was added to this probiotic mixture, improvements were similar to those seen with the probiotic mixture alone.\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for heart failure.\nA small clinical study in patients with NYHA Class II or III heart failure shows that taking S. Boulardii 1000 mg daily for 3 months is associated with an improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and decreased left atrial diameter when compared with baseline (98399). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. However, a larger preliminary clinical trial in a similar population given standard care shows that taking the same dose of S. Boulardii CNCM I-745 does not improve LVEF or the distance walked in 6 minutes when compared with standard care alone (107608).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking S. Boulardii orally up to 3 grams daily seems to help reduce HIV-related diarrhea, although the details of this research are unclear (72168, 72195).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for hypercholesterolemia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking S. Boulardii 14 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect lipid parameters when compared to baseline in patients with hypercholesterolemia (98732). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIntestinal parasite infection. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for intestinal parasite infection.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with amebiasis or infection with Entamoeba histolytica shows that taking a specific S. Boulardii product (Ultra-levure, Biocodex) 250 mg three times daily orally in combination with a conventional antibiotic regimen (metronidazole and iodoquinol) for 4 weeks improves diarrhea duration and abdominal pain when compared with conventional antibiotic treatment alone (72131).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for IBS.\nOne clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) or mixed-type IBS shows that taking S. boulardii (Bioflor, Kuhnil) 200 billion colony-forming units daily for 4 weeks improves quality of life about 2.2-fold more than placebo. However, taking this product does not seem to improve abdominal pain and discomfort, stool consistency, urgency, bloating, or other symptoms of this condition (95359). Similarly, a meta-analysis of a small number of clinical studies shows that taking S. boulardii CNCM I-745 does not reduce the severity of abdominal pain when compared with placebo; however, it may increase the frequency of abdominal pain relief (107594). Another clinical study shows that taking S. boulardii 200 mg orally three times daily for 30 days along with mesalazine 800 mg three times daily does not improve symptoms of IBS-D better than mesalazine alone (92808). However, the results of this latter study are limited by the fact that a blinded placebo was not provided to the control group.\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for growth in low birth weight infants.\nPreliminary clinical research in preterm infants with low birth weight shows that giving a specific S. boulardii supplement (Bioflor, Biocodex) 50 mg/kg twice daily, in addition to infant formula for at least 7 days and up to 28 days after birth, increases weight gain and feeding tolerance when compared to consuming infant formula alone (98734).\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for neonatal jaundice prevention or treatment.\nOne clinical study shows that S. boulardii 250 mg dissolved in 10 mL of water and given orally once daily for 2 days reduces the percentage of term infants who develop jaundice by 4% and reduces the percentage of these infants who require phototherapy by 12% when compared with placebo (95413). It is not known if S. boulardii reduces the risk of neonatal jaundice in at-risk infants, such as preterm infants or those with fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility. Giving S. boulardii along with phototherapy does not improve bilirubin levels or decrease the duration of required phototherapy in preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinemia (92806).\nless\nObesity. Oral Saccharomyces boulardii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in obese patients shows that taking S. boulardii 5 billion colony-forming units with superoxide dismutase 400 IU twice daily for 60 days does not reduce body weight, body mass index, or measures of hunger and satiety when compared with placebo (106848).\nless\nPeriodontitis.

However, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences for this outcome.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii improves postoperative recovery.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing resection of the colon shows that taking S. boulardii 100 mg daily for at least 7 days before surgery, along with conventional prophylaxis with antibiotics, does not reduce length of hospital stay when compared with conventional treatment alone (111105). However, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences for this outcome.\nless\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for SIBO.\nA small clinical study in patients with SIBO and systemic sclerosis shows that adding S. boulardii 200 mg twice daily for 14 days to metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days eradicates SIBO to a greater degree than metronidazole alone (102420). However, another small clinical study in patients with SIBO and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome shows that taking S. boulardii 250 mg twice daily while receiving dietary advice for 15 days does not increase the rate of SIBO eradication when compared with dietary advice alone (111104). However, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences for this outcome.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral Saccharomyces boulardii is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii 250 mg three times daily can reduce symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis who experience a flare up despite maintenance treatment with mesalamine (5-aminosalycilic acid, 5-ASA) 1 gram three times daily (14380).

This risk seems to increase when powder packets are used or capsules are opened at the bedside (12776, 12777, 14459, 95358, 95360, 95362, 95363).\nless\nELDERLY\nTheoretically, elderly adults are thought to have an increased risk for fungemia with ingestion of Saccharomyces boulardii; use with caution. Aging is associated with dysbiosis, degeneration of the intestinal barrier, and dysfunction of the gut immune system, which might lead to an increased risk for fungemia (98728).\nless\nGASTROINTESTINAL TRACT DISEASE\nTheoretically, patients with a gastrointestinal tract disease might have an increased risk for fungemia with the use of Saccharomyces boulardii. A hospital study from Finland found that 59% of patients that developed Saccharomyces fungemia had a digestive tract disease (107607).\nless\nIMMUNODEFICIENCY\nImmunocompromised or critically ill patients taking Saccharomyces boulardii might have an increased risk for fungemia. Although Saccharomyces is generally a nonpathogenic organism, there have been numerous cases of fungemia following its use, primarily in immunocompromised or critically ill patients, especially those with indwelling or central venous catheters, those receiving enteral feeding, or those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (1247, 4357, 4358, 4360, 14459, 72121, 72126, 72142, 92809, 95357)(95358, 95360, 95362, 95363, 105171).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSaccharomyces boulardii is typically a non-pathogenic yeast (4363).\nAnti-amoebae activity\nIn vitro data suggests that Saccharomyces boulardii can reduce the number of red blood cells adhering to amoebae and decrease the number of amoebae bearing red blood cells (92815).\nAnti-stress effects\nClinical research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii decreases salivary serotonin levels under conditions of psychological stress. However, although salivary levels of serotonin were associated with pulse rate, there was no association with anxiety, depression, or other markers of stress. Therefore, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear (107609).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSaccharomyces boulardii is used as a probiotic agent to help colonize the gastrointestinal tract. It is used therapeutically in cases where disease is thought to occur due to depleted normal intestinal flora or colonization by pathogenic organisms (4363, 18088). Some in vitro evidence shows that S. boulardii competes for attachment sites and blocks adherence of Clostridioides difficile, which helps prevent infection (72120, 92813). S. boulardii is also thought to help for C. difficile infection by producing proteases that might decrease the toxicity of C. difficile toxins A and B (4348, 4361, 72187). Individuals who have low stool concentrations of S. boulardii after repeated use are most likely to have C. difficile recurrence (4360).\n\nIn addition to its effect on C. difficile, S. boulardii also shows evidence of interaction with cholera toxin (4363). In Crohn disease, S. boulardii increases secretory immune globulin A (IgA) in the intestine (7646). S. boulardii might cause an increase in the intestinal chloride resorption, which also may play a role in the treatment of Crohn disease (4362, 7646).\n\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking S. boulardii along with miglustat might reduce miglustat-associated gastrointestinal disturbances in some people. Gastrointestinal disturbances caused by miglustat are thought to result from the inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases, particularly sucrase isomaltase. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to maldigestion of sucrose. S. boulardii is thought to help prevent this adverse effect by secreting sucrase, which can aid in the digestion of sucrose (95414)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of safed musli is the root. The root provides 42% carbohydrates, 8% to 9% protein, 3% to 4% fiber and 2% to 17% saponins. The root contains several steroidal and triterpenoidal saponins, sapogenins, and fructans (18047). The saponins are known as borivilianosides (18050). Some products containing safed musli are standardized based on saponin content.\nAndrogenic effects\nSafed musli is used for bodybuilding and for improving sexual performance due to purported androgenic and anabolic effects. In animal models given aqueous extracts of safed musli, there was a significantly increased overall bodyweight and increased weight of reproductive organs. Additionally, animals receiving the extracts had increases in several measures of sexual activity. These effects suggest possible androgenic effects (18049).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSafed musli seems to have anti-inflammatory effects. In an animal model of arthritis, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of safed musli significantly reduced signs of inflammation when compared to controls (18049).\nImmunostimulant effects\nAnimal research suggests that safed musli has immunostimulant effects. In animals infected with Candida albicans, administration of an ethanol extract of safed musli significantly increased survival rates compared to controls. Safed musli extract also reduced the impact of drug-induced immunosuppression in animals by increasing hemoglobin, platelets, and red blood cell and white blood cell counts. The whole ethanol extract of safed musli appears to have greater immunostimulant activity than the isolated sapogenin fraction (18048)."

Several small studies suggest that oral safflower oil, as a substitute for coconut oil, butter, or other animal fats in the diet, may reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia.\nThree small clinical studies in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia show that substituting coconut oil, butter, or other animal fats in the diet with safflower oil (36% of total daily calories) for 4-6 weeks can lower levels of total and LDL cholesterol, but has no beneficial effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides (25391, 25393, 72310).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Safflower oil, which is high in oleic acid, may be beneficial for reducing the risk of CHD when used to replace other dietary oils.\nSome safflower oil products contain high quantities of oleic acid. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 tablespoons daily of oils containing at least 70% oleic acid may reduce the risk of CHD. In order to obtain any benefit, this oil must be used to replace fats and oils higher in saturated fat. However, the FDA has determined that this statement is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (98563).\nless\nCystic fibrosis.

Small clinical studies of oral safflower oil for improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes have yielded mixed results.\nOne very small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking safflower oil 10 grams daily for 3 weeks increases fasting blood glucose by 11% when compared to baseline. Insulin levels, insulin sensitivity, and lipid levels were not affected (13146). However, another small clinical study in obese, postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking safflower oil 2 grams four times daily for 16 weeks decreases HbA1c by 0.64% and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 5 mg/dL when compared with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) 2 grams four times daily. Insulin sensitivity and fasting blood glucose levels do not appear to be affected (94039). These differing outcomes may be due to the small study sizes and varied patient populations.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous safflower yellow, a component of safflower flower, might improve symptoms and markers of diabetic nephropathy.\nA meta-analysis of small low-quality clinical trials in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that intravenous administration of safflower yellow, specifically the hydroxyl safflower yellow A (HSYA) compound, with or without conventional treatment improves indices of renal function including reductions in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urinary albumin excretion rate and improves glycemic parameters when compared with conventional treatment (116248). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the short follow period (12 weeks or less) in the included studies.\nless\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Small clinical studies suggest that substituting safflower oil in place of butter in the diet may modestly reduce cholesterol levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.\nTwo very small clinical studies in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia show that substituting safflower oil in place of butter in the diet (contributing 36% of daily calories) for 3 weeks decreases total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with butter (72246, 72267).\nless\nHepatitis C.

The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nScarring. Topical safflower oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with non-hypertrophic scars and striae shows that applying an oil containing safflower oil 55.9%, olive oil 42%, grapefruit oil 2%, and tocopherol 0.1% (Kneipp Bio Skin Oil, Kneipp GmbH) to the scars and striae twice daily for 8 weeks improves scores on the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS) by 20%, compared to a 6% improvement in untreated areas (95938).\nless\nStroke. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous safflower yellow, a constituent of safflower flower, as an adjunct to conventional treatments, may improve neurological outcomes post-stroke.\nA meta-analysis of seven small, low-quality clinical studies in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke shows that intravenous administration of safflower yellow 100-150 mg as an adjunct to conventional treatments, starting within 72 hours of stroke onset and continuing once daily for 14 days thereafter, increases the odds of neurological improvement by about 3-fold when compared with conventional treatments alone (94038).\nless\nUnstable angina. Intravenous safflower yellow, a component of safflower flower, might improve outcomes when used as an adjunct to conventional therapy for the treatment of unstable angina.\nA meta-analysis of seven low-quality clinical studies in Chinese patients with unstable angina shows that intravenous safflower yellow 50-150 mg daily for 14-15 days in addition to conventional treatment modestly improves electrocardiogram (ECG) measures and symptoms of angina when compared with conventional treatment alone (94041). Another meta-analysis of 16 small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, shows that intravenous administration of safflower yellow 20-40 mL daily for 10-15 days as an adjunct to conventional therapy improves clinical outcomes, ECG measures, and left ventricular ejection fraction when compared with placebo (108891).\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE).

However, clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome with or without impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking safflower oil 8 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting glucose levels by around 8 mg/dL (108889). Some clinical research also shows that taking safflower oil 8 grams daily for 16 weeks does not affect fasting glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (94039).

It should be avoided in people with bleeding disorders. Small clinical studies show that taking safflower oil, approximately 55 grams daily for 2-3 weeks, decreases platelet aggregation (72241, 72303). However, taking lower doses of safflower oil, such as 5 grams daily for 4 weeks, does not seem to affect platelet function (66267).\nless\nCROSS-ALLERGENICITY\nSafflower can cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with safflower.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of safflower.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of safflower are the flower and seed oil. Safflower flower contains a complex mixture of red and yellow pigments (11, 18).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn patients with diabetic nephropathy, hydroxyl safflower yellow A, a constituent of safflower, reduces inflammatory markers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (116248).\nAnticoagulant effects\nThe constituent, safflower yellow, has anticoagulant activity (11). Animal studies suggest that safflower yellow and water-soluble safflower extracts increase prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values. When co-administered with warfarin, safflower preparations increase the plasma concentration, half-life, and area under the curve (AUC) of warfarin, while reducing its clearance. This suggests that constituents of safflower inhibit warfarin metabolism(95939, 116250).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn patients with diabetic nephropathy, hydroxyl safflower yellow A, a constituent of safflower, increases levels of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress (116248).\nAntiviral effects\nThere is interest in using safflower oil for human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced laryngeal papillomatosis. Patients with recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis show over-expression of PPAR delta/beta, and an imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cells. In vitro data suggests that conjugated linoleic acid may induce apoptosis via restoration of PPAR balance, modify both innate and adaptive immunity, and improve cellular and humoral response to viral infections (94042).\nCardiovascular effects\nSafflower extracts exhibit cardiac stimulant, vasodilating, hypolipemic, hypotensive, and vasoprotective properties (11, 94043). Other evidence suggests that diets high in unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce atherosclerosis and the risk of heart disease (6). A diet rich in safflower oil can increase platelet linoleic acid levels, reduce serum cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels without affecting serum triglyceride, high-density (HDL) lipoprotein cholesterol, or apolipoprotein A-1 levels (6, 94040). Clinical research suggests that safflower yellow, a constituent of safflower, might inhibit nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 to decrease inflammation in patients with cardiac disease (94041). Also, animal research suggests that safflower yellow might have beneficial effects after cardiovascular events. Safflower yellow extract improves cardiac function, reduces cardiomyocyte death, increases antioxidant enzymes, and decreases the activity of lactase dehydrogenase, a marker associated with cardiac tissue injury, in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (111415).\nGenitourinary effects\nSafflower extracts exhibit uterine stimulant properties (11, 8142).\nImmunologic effects\nThe constituent, safflower yellow, has immunosuppressive activity (11, 72242). Safflower polysaccharide has immunopotentiating effects (11).\nNeurologic effects\nSafflower seed oil is a rich source of the essential unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (6). It also contains linolenic acid (18). Some evidence suggests essential fatty acids are necessary to maintain the integrity of the central nervous system (6).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research in rats fed a high-fat diet shows that safflower oil can reduce abdominal fat but does not seem to improve body weight (108890)."

    "Saffron": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Saffron is a spice, coloring agent, and medicinal product derived from the dried pistil of the perennial plant, Crocus sativus. The pistil includes the top stigma as well as a long style that contains the ovary of the plant (100130, 100137, 100139). Saffron has been used as a traditional spice, coloring agent, and medicinal agent for at least 3000 years. It is common in countries such as India, Greece, France, Spain, Italy, and also Iran, where most of the world's saffron is cultivated (93399, 93409, 93410, 100130, 100138).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Saffron has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US for use as a spice or food coloring agent (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in larger amounts, short-term. Saffron extracts have been used with apparent safety in clinical trials at doses of up to 100 mg daily for up to 26 weeks (11024, 13103, 16555, 17214, 17401, 18102, 93395, 93397, 93400, 93403)(93407, 97359, 99436, 100135, 100138, 100140, 100658, 100659, 113715, 113727). The saffron constituent crocin has been used with apparent safety at a dose of up to 30 mg daily for up to 3 months (93410, 100139, 105616, 113720).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses or for longer than 26 weeks. Taking 5 grams or more of saffron can cause severe side effects. Doses of 12-20 grams can be lethal (12, 18).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of saffron when used topically.\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts exceeding those commonly found in foods. Larger amounts of saffron have uterine stimulant and abortifacient effects (18); avoid using.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, saffron extract seems to be generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Gastrointestinal complaints, nausea, sedation, vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Anaphylaxis.\nDermatologic\nOrally, sweating and flushing have been reported in clinical research for patients taking saffron 30-60 mg daily (93402, 93409). Saffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more and symptoms include yellow appearance of the skin (2, 11).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, saffron has been associated with changes in appetite, nausea, and vomiting when given at doses of 30 mg twice daily for 26 weeks, or when the saffron constituent crocin was given as 15 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (18102, 105616). At lower doses of 30 mg daily, the occurrence rate of these and other adverse events such as dry mouth, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and constipation was rare or similar to placebo (13103, 93395, 93402, 93409). Saffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more and symptoms include yellow appearance of the mucous membranes (mimicking icterus), vomiting, and bloody diarrhea (2, 11).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOne report of excessive uterine bleeding occurred in a clinical trial. The patient was taking the saffron constituent crocin 15 mg twice daily. It is unclear whether this event was related to treatment with the saffron constituent (93410).\n\nSaffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more; symptoms include bleeding from the uterus (2, 11).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, saffron extract has been reported to cause decreases in platelet, white blood cell, and red blood cell counts after 7 days to 12 weeks of use with doses of 60-200 mg daily. Many of these decreases were only significant when compared to baseline but did not maintain significance when compared to placebo. These reductions were not considered clinically significant (18102, 72473, 93403, 93409).\n\nSaffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more; symptoms include bloody diarrhea, hematuria, bleeding from the nose, lips, eyelids or uterus, and thrombocytopenic purpura (2, 11).\nless\nImmunologic\nAllergy to oral saffron has been reported in clinical trials (93404). Anaphylactic reactions can occur within minutes of eating food prepared with saffron (4107, 72555). Occupational exposure to saffron has been associated with the development of rhinoconjunctivitis and allergy-induced asthma (4106).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, saffron has been reported to cause drowsiness, headache, agitation, and sedation when given at doses of 30 mg twice daily for up to 26 weeks or when crocin is given as 15 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (18102, 105616). At doses of 30 mg daily for 6 weeks, the side effect occurrence rate was similar to placebo (13103). Saffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more; symptoms include vertigo and numbness (2, 11).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, saffron poisoning with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more can cause ocular symptoms such as yellow appearance of the sclera (2, 11).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, saffron has been reported to cause anxiety and hypomania when given at doses of 30 mg twice daily for 26 weeks (18102). At doses of 30 mg daily for 6 weeks, the occurrence rate was similar to placebo (13103, 93395). One report of agitation occurred in a clinical trial. The patient was taking the saffron constituent crocin 15 mg twice daily. It is unclear whether this event was related to treatment with the saffron constituent (93410).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, the saffron constituent crocin given as 15 mg twice daily for 12 week was associated with one case of urinary incontinence (105616). Saffron poisoning can occur with oral intake of doses of 5 grams or more; symptoms include hematuria and uremic collapse (2, 11).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Oral saffron might modestly improve cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nTwo small clinical trials in patients with probable Alzheimer disease living in Iran shows that taking saffron extract (Green Plants of Life, Co., previously Impiran) 15 mg orally twice daily for 16-22 weeks improves cognitive ability and disease progression when compared with placebo, and is no different for improving cognition when compared with taking donepezil (Aricept) 10 mg daily (17401, 93395). Another small clinical study in adults also living in Iran with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily for 48 weeks seems to be no different for improving cognition when compared with taking memantine (Namenda) 20 mg (105617). It is unclear if these findings are generalizable to patients in other geographic locations.\nless\nDepression. Oral saffron extract seems to improve symptoms of depression when used alone or as an adjunct to conventional antidepressants.\nMeta-analyses and clinical trials in adults with mild to moderate major depressive disorder show that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily or dried saffron stigma 100 mg daily for 6-12 weeks improves symptoms of depression when compared with control (11024, 13103, 72434, 93399, 93404, 100140, 103928, 103931, 113727). Saffron extract also seems to be comparable to imipramine 100 mg daily, fluoxetine 10 mg twice daily, citalopram 40 mg daily, or sertraline 100 mg daily when used for 6-12 weeks; however, many prescription antidepressants take at least 8-12 weeks to produce benefit (11024, 17222, 19032, 93399, 100140, 100658, 103927, 113727, 116078). Furthermore, some clinical research shows that taking a specific saffron extract (affron, Pharmactive Biotech Products) 14 mg twice daily for 8 weeks or the saffron constituent, crocin, 15 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, as an adjunct to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) modestly reduces depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (93410, 103934). However, other research has produced mixed or negative results (116697), which may be due to the use of different depression scales. An umbrella meta-analysis consisting of 7 separate meta-analyses shows that taking saffron, either alone or with other treatments, improves symptoms of depression when compared with control in studies using the Beck depression inventory criteria, but not in those using the Hamilton depression rating scale, the depression anxiety stress scale, or mixed scales (108911). In general, the validity of the available research is limited by the variety of saffron doses and treatment durations, as well as the fact that most research has been conducted in Iran which may limit generalizability to other geographic regions and populations.\n\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that saffron at doses of approximately 30 mg of the stigma, or standardized to safranal or crocin isomers, 1-3 times daily, depending on the extract, is provisionally recommended for either monotherapy or adjunctive use for mild to moderate depression (110318).\n\nIt is unclear if saffron is beneficial for comorbid depression and anxiety. A small clinical trial in adults with this condition shows that taking saffron extract 15 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve symptoms of depression, but does improve symptoms of anxiety, when compared with placebo (100137). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect smaller differences between groups.\n\nSaffron has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial in adults with major depressive disorder shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily in combination with curcumin 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (97359). The validity of this finding may be limited by the large placebo response.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for AMD.\nTwo clinical studies in adults 50 years and older with mild to moderate AMD shows that taking saffron extract 20 mg daily for 3 months modestly improves visual acuity and retinal flicker sensitivity when compared with placebo (93398, 100135). In one study, most patients had already been taking Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS) supplements or equivalent at baseline; they were permitted to continue throughout the study (100135). An open-label extension of this study shows that taking saffron 20 mg daily for 12 months improves multifocal electroretinogram response density, but not visual acuity, when compared to baseline (113729). The validity of this extension study is limited by the lack of a control group. The small improvements seen in these studies were considered to be of unclear clinical significance (93398, 100135, 113729).\nless\nAntidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Small studies suggest that oral saffron may reduce some symptoms of fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction.\nOne small clinical study in females with major depression stabilized on fluoxetine 40 mg daily shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily for 4 weeks improves arousal, lubrication, and pain during sexual intercourse when compared with placebo (93401). A small clinical study in males with major depression stabilized on fluoxetine 40 mg daily shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily improves erectile dysfunction and intercourse satisfaction when compared with placebo (93407). However, taking saffron does not appear to significantly improve desire, overall satisfaction, or orgasm in patients taking fluoxetine (93401, 93407).\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces metabolic side effects from antipsychotic treatment.\nA small clinical study in adults with schizophrenia who are taking olanzapine shows that taking saffron aqueous extract 30 mg daily for 12 weeks, or crocin, a constituent of saffron, 30 mg daily for 6 weeks, reduces fasting blood glucose and the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. At 6 weeks, metabolic syndrome occurred in 0% of patients taking saffron, about 9% of patients taking crocin, and about 27% of patients taking placebo. Levels of cholesterol, HBA1c, and insulin were unchanged (93397).\nless\nAnxiety. Small clinical studies suggest that oral saffron might reduce symptoms of anxiety in adults with various medical diagnoses.\nSmall clinical studies in adults who are either healthy or have a wide range of medical diagnoses, including cardiovascular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and more, suggest that taking saffron extract 30-60 mg daily for 4-22 weeks may modestly reduce symptoms of anxiety when compared with placebo (93404, 100137, 113727, 116078).\nless\nAsthma. There is limited evidence on the oral use of saffron in patients with allergic asthma.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate allergic asthma shows that taking saffron extract 100 mg daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms of asthma, but not asthma severity, when compared with placebo. The use of salbutamol was reduced by approximately 50% in patients taking saffron. Saffron also produced modest improvements in waking during the night due to asthma symptoms, shortness of breath during the night, and activity limitation (100141). However, due to the low rate of symptoms at baseline, it is difficult to determine if these improvements are clinically significant.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral saffron, or its constituent crocetin, is beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in healthy, untrained, young adult males shows that taking dried saffron stigma powder 300 mg every evening for 10 days improves muscular force by up to 10% and might improve reaction time when compared with placebo (93406). A very small clinical study in healthy adults suggests that taking crocetin, a constituent of saffron, 15 mg daily for 8 days might improve performance on a 3.5-hour physically exhausting task in males, but not in females, when compared with placebo (19058).\n\nOther research has evaluated the acute effects of a single dose of saffron. A crossover study in young, healthy, physically active male adults shows that taking a single dose of saffron 300 mg 2 hours before repeated shuttle sprints does not improve performance or reduce ratings of perceived exertion when compared with placebo (116079).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial in adults or children with ADHD; clinical research has yielded conflicting findings.\nSaffron has been evaluated in conjunction with prescription stimulants in both children and adults with ADHD. Two small clinical studies in children 6-17 years old with ADHD in Iran have produced conflicting findings. Although both studies utilized the same treatment regimen of saffron 20-30 mg daily with methylphenidate 20-30 mg daily (dose determined by weight above or below 30 kg) for 8 weeks, one study identified improvements in parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms when compared with methylphenidate alone (116884), while the other study found no improvements in these measures when compared with methylphenidate alone (116886). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with ADHD in Iran shows that adding saffron stigma 30 mg daily to treatment with methylphenidate 30 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve ADHD scores when compared with methylphenidate alone (116885). These studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nSaffron has also been evaluated as monotherapy in children. A small, open-label clinical study in treatment-naïve children with ADHD in Spain shows that taking a specific saffron product (Saffr'activ, Masso) 30 mg daily for 3 months improves inattention and some aspects of executive functioning, but not hyperactivity, to a similar extent as methylphenidate 1 mg/kg daily (113713). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of blinding and randomization.\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces burning mouth syndrome.\nA very small clinical study in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking the saffron constituent crocin 15 mg daily for 11 weeks seems to reduce pain to a similar degree as citalopram 20 mg daily (103937).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\nA clinical crossover study in adults with mild to severe chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy shows that taking the saffron constituent crocin 15 mg twice daily for 8 weeks progressively improves pain scores when compared with placebo, with significant improvements appearing after 5 weeks of treatment. This study included patients who were actively receiving chemotherapy and those who had completed or discontinued treatment; however, a separate analysis for each subgroup was not conducted (108904).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. Oral saffron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with breast cancer and chemotherapy-related fatigue shows that drinking a traditional beverage (Jollab) containing saffron 8 mg, rose water, and honey three times daily for 4 weeks reduces scores on one, but not all, cancer fatigue scales when compared with placebo (110001). It is unclear if these effects are due to saffron, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, it is unclear if adequate blinding was achieved due to the natural flavor of the saffron-based beverage.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for COPD.\nA small clinical study in males with COPD shows that taking crocin, one of the primary constituents in saffron, 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve pulmonary function or 6-minute walking distance when compared with placebo (113720).\nless\nCough. Although there is interest in using oral saffron for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saffron for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral saffron or its constituent, crocin, are beneficial for glycemic control in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Clinical research is conflicting.\nSome clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking saffron extract 15-30 mg daily, saffron powder 100 mg daily, or drinking black tea stewed with saffron powder 1 gram three times daily for 2-3 months does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), but might modestly reduce fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo (99436, 100138, 103936, 108905, 113719, 116698). The validity of these findings is limited due to differences in glycemic control at baseline and saffron treatment regimens. One meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking saffron, saffron extract, or the constituent crocin for up to 3 months does not improve levels of fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, or HbA1c when compared with placebo or control. However, this analysis pooled data from healthy individuals, as well as patients with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease (CAD), schizophrenia, or depression, with no separate analyses conducted in those with type 2 diabetes (100139). A similar meta-analysis that also pooled data from these varied patient populations found no improvement in fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, or insulin resistance when studies of adults with type 2 diabetes were analyzed separately (113716). However, other recent meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking saffron or crocin for 8-12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and HbA1c (113499, 113723, 113731, 116077). The reason for the discrepant findings from these meta-analyses may be related to the high heterogeneity identified between studies, much of which is related to differences in statistical methods and the use of highly varied treatment regimens and durations. Additionally, many studies were determined to be of very low- to low-quality. The large majority were conducted in Iran which may limit generalizability to other geographic regions and populations.\n\nSaffron has also been evaluated in type 1 diabetes. A small clinical study in adults with type 1 diabetes shows that taking saffron extract 28 mg three times daily for 6 months does not improve glycemic control when compared with placebo. People in both study groups also took a combination of prebiotics, probiotics, and magnesium (116076).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for dyslipidemia; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analyses of clinical studies shows that taking saffron, saffron extract, or the constituent crocin for up to 3 months does not reduce levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides, or increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo or control. However, study participants included those with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease (CAD), schizophrenia, and depression, as well as healthy or mildly overweight individuals (100139, 113716). Conversely, one small clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with dyslipidemia shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, but does not alter HDL cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo (113712). However, there was a lack of parity in baseline lipid levels between study groups.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral saffron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in students with dysmenorrhea shows that taking a specific combination product containing saffron, celery seed, and anise extracts (SCA, Gol Daro Herbal Medicine Laboratory) 500 mg three times daily for 3 days reduces the severity and duration of menstrual pain when compared with placebo (17214).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral or topical saffron improves ED; the available research is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diabetes and ED shows that applying a gel containing saffron 1% to the penis 30 minutes prior to intercourse for one month improves general symptoms when compared with placebo. ED, sexual desire, and orgasmic function improved by 37%, 14%, and 21%, respectively, for those using saffron gel compared to 2%, 2%, and 0%, respectively, for those in the placebo group (93408). A small, open-label study has also shown benefit with dried oral saffron 200 mg daily for 10 days (19057). However, in adults with ED who are naïve to treatment, one small clinical study shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg twice daily by mouth for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms when compared to baseline (93409). These conflicting results may be related to the cause of ED, as well as the route, dose, and form of saffron used.\nless\nErythema. Oral saffron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adult females with self-perceived skin sensitivity shows that taking a specific oral combination product (InnerCalm, Arbonne) containing saffron, L-theanine, and ashwagandha daily for 8 weeks does not reduce facial redness when compared to baseline (111399). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for adults undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.\nA small clinical study in adults in Iran newly diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma shows that taking crocin, a primary constituent of saffron, 15 mg twice daily for 5 weeks during chemoradiation therapy modestly reduces depression scores at 5 weeks, but does not alter the rate of chemoradiation-related adverse effects or survival or recurrence rates at 1 year, when compared with placebo (113733).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces muscle soreness from exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy but exercise-naïve young adult males shows that taking dried saffron powder 300 mg every evening for 10 days, starting one week before a leg press exercise, reduces delayed muscle soreness about 11-fold when compared with placebo. Saffron appears to be more effective than indomethacin for reducing pain and maintaining muscle force during the 72-hour period post-exercise (93405).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma.\nA small clinical study in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma shows that taking saffron extract 30 mg daily for 4 weeks, in conjunction with timolol and dorzolamide, reduces intraocular pressure by an additional 16.5% when compared with placebo. After a 4-week washout, intraocular pressure returned to baseline in the saffron group (93400).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces blood pressure in adults with hypertension.\nA small clinical study in adults with diabetes and elevated systolic blood pressure shows that drinking black tea containing saffron 1 gram three times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure when compared with baseline (96669). A small clinical study in males with hypertension shows that taking saffron stigma 200 mg daily for 12 weeks seems to reduce blood pressure when compared with no intervention (105618).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral saffron improves glycemic control in adults or adolescents with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with prediabetes and obesity shows that taking saffron extract 15 mg daily for 2 months modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo (103933). It is unclear if this small improvement in glycemic control is maintained after 2 months. Conversely, a small clinical study in adolescents with prediabetes and obesity shows that taking saffron 30 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose or insulin levels, HbA1c, or insulin resistance when compared with placebo (113728).\nless\nInsomnia. Some clinical research suggests that oral or intranasal saffron may modestly improve sleep quality or duration in some healthy adults or those with underlying medical conditions.\nThree meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with insomnia, with or without other medical conditions including type 2 diabetes or opioid dependence, shows that taking saffron 0.6-100 mg orally daily for 1-8 weeks or 8 mg intranasally daily for 8 weeks, improves sleep quality and duration when compared with placebo (108912, 113714, 113727). However, improvements in sleep latency, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and use of sleep aids are not observed (113714). The majority of the included studies were funded by the supplement manufacturer, which may limit the validity of these findings. Additionally, the majority of the outcomes were patient-reported, with no studies reporting the use of polysomnography (113714).\nless\nLabor pain. Although there is interest in using oral saffron to reduce labor pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saffron for this purpose.\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for improving sperm parameters in males with infertility.\nClinical research in males under 45 years of age with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia shows that taking a saffron extract 30 mg orally twice daily for 26 weeks does not increase sperm motility, density, or morphology when compared with placebo (18102). Other preliminary clinical research in males with idiopathic infertility shows that taking saffron 50 mg three times each week for 3 months improves sperm motility and morphology, but not sperm count, when compared to baseline (19033). These conflicting outcomes may be related to the cause of infertility, as well as the dose and form of saffron used.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking a specific saffron stigma extract (affron, Pharmactive Biotech Products) 14 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves symptoms of depression and anxiety, but not vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, when compared with placebo (105622).\n\nSaffron has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking a combination of saffron 60 mg, fennel 120 mg, and chamomile 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces physical, psychological, and urogenital symptom scores on the Menopause Rating Scale when compared with either placebo or lower doses of this combination (103628). The validity of this study is limited by unclear reporting of results. Also, it is unclear if reported benefits are due to saffron, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for improving mental health in adults with MS.\nA small clinical study in adults in Iran with MS shows that taking crocin, a primary constituent of saffron, 15 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve symptoms of anxiety or depression when compared with placebo (113732). Another small clinical study in Iranian females with mild to moderate MS shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, with or without an exercise program, improves symptoms of depression and quality of life when compared with a control group. However, these changes were similar to those seen in people who only participated in the exercise program (113709).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces symptoms of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with MS shows that taking one tablespoon of simple syrup containing saffron extract 0.5% every 8 hours for two months reduces fatigue when compared with baseline (103930). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nNicotine dependence. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for treating nicotine dependence.\nA small clinical study in adults and late adolescents who smoke cigarettes shows that taking crocin, a primary constituent of saffron, 15 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce nicotine dependence scores or symptoms of anxiety when compared with baseline or placebo (113735).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for weight management in obesity. Clinical research is conflicting and effect sizes are small and of unclear clinical significance.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking saffron 15-200 mg daily for 4-12 weeks, or its constituent crocin 30-100 mg daily for 6-8 weeks, does not reduce body weight, waist circumference, or body mass index (BMI) when compared with control (113716). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low quality of evidence and the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment regimens. Additionally, most studies were conducted in Iran which may limit generalizability to other geographic regions and populations.\n\nSaffron has also been evaluated in adolescents. A small clinical study in adolescents with obesity and prediabetes shows that taking saffron 30 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight, BMI, and waist circumference when compared with placebo, but not when compared with metformin 1000 mg daily. People taking metformin experienced a numerically greater improvement in all anthropometric indices when compared with saffron (113728). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of direct comparison between the saffron and metformin treatment groups.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral saffron reduces symptoms of OCD.\nA small clinical study in adults in Iran with mild to moderate OCD shows that taking crocin, a constituent of saffron, 15 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) to a similar extent as fluoxetine 20 mg daily (105620). Another small clinical study in a similar population shows that taking a specific saffron extract (SaffroMood, Green Plants of Life) 15 mg twice daily for 10 weeks reduces Y-BOCS scores similarly to fluvoxamine 100 mg daily (116887). The validity of these studies is limited by the small sample sizes. Additionally, the short durations may have been inadequate to identify an effect with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can take 8-12 weeks to demonstrate benefit.\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for opioid withdrawal; the available research is conflicting.\nA small clinical study in adults receiving treatment with methadone for opioid abuse shows that taking crocin, a constituent of saffron, 30 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms when compared with placebo (105616). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients with opioid dependence shows that taking a specific product (Krocina) containing crocin, a constituent of saffron, 15 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to motivational counseling does not improve withdrawal symptoms, cravings, depression, anxiety, or stress during the detoxification or abstinence phase (108913). The reason for these conflicting findings is unclear but may be related to the differences in adjunctive treatments between studies.\nless\nParturition. Oral saffron has only been evaluated in combination with honey; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in nulliparous adults shows that consuming a saffron and honey drink, starting at the 4 cm dilation stage of labor and continuing every 30-60 minutes until the end of the active phase of the first stage of labor, reduces the duration of the active phase of all stages of labor when compared with placebo syrup, but not when compared with date syrup. Each participant consumed no more than 150 mL of the drink, which contained a total of saffron 250 mg and honey 12.5 mL (113722). It is unclear if this effect is due to saffron, honey, or the combination.\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for improving happiness in the postmenopausal period.\nA clinical study conducted in Iran in postmenopausal adults shows that steeping 30 mg of dried saffron in a cup of tea daily for 6 weeks improves scores on the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire when compared with placebo (113710). The validity of this study is limited by inadequate blinding due to the use of a plain hot water placebo not matched for color or taste.\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for speeding recovery from postpartum depression.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients experiencing symptoms of depression less than 12 weeks after giving birth shows that taking saffron 30 mg daily for 6 weeks (SaffroMood, Green Plants of Life Co. Ltd) is as effective as fluoxetine for treating depression. Both treatment groups experienced similar remission and partial response rates (93402). Another preliminary study in breastfeeding Iranian patients with mild to moderate depression shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves depressive symptoms by about 50% when compared to baseline (97361). However, it is not clear if the improvement in these studies was related to saffron or the natural resolution of postpartum depression.\nless\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It is unclear if oral saffron improves PMDD symptoms.\nA clinical study in patients with PMDD shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily for 14 days prior to menstruation improves patient-rated PMDD symptom severity when compared with placebo, but not when compared with taking fluoxetine 20 mg twice daily (105625).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral saffron improves PMS symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients aged 20-45 years with PMS shows that taking a specific saffron extract 15 mg twice daily throughout two menstrual cycles improves symptom severity when compared with placebo (16555).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using oral saffron for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saffron for this condition.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral saffron reduces symptoms of RA when added to standard treatments; research findings are conflicting.\nA small clinical study in females with active RA that had been diagnosed at least 2 years prior shows that adding oral saffron 100 mg daily for 3 months to treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) modestly reduces pain and the number of tender and swollen joints when compared with placebo. However, the patients in these groups had differing levels of pain and swelling at baseline (103932). The validity of this study is limited by the fact that all clinical parameters were secondary, exploratory outcomes. In contrast, a small clinical study in adults with newly diagnosed active RA shows that adding saffron 100 mg daily for 3 months to standard treatment with prednisolone 5 mg daily and methotrexate 7.5 mg once weekly does not improve disease activity or quality of life when compared with placebo and standard treatment (108907). The validity of this finding is limited by the high dropout rate in both groups.\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral saffron is beneficial for female sexual dysfunction.\nA clinical study in adult females in Iran with severe sexual dysfunction shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily for 6 weeks modestly improves female sexual function index scores, with the greatest improvements seen in the subdomain of satisfaction, when compared with placebo (113715). A small clinical study in adult females with sexual dysfunction shows that taking saffron 15 mg twice daily with vitamin E 50 mg once daily improves overall sexual function index scores and the subdomains of libido, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction, but not pain or anxiety, when compared with vitamin E alone (113730).\nless\nStress. It is unclear if sublingual saffron attenuates the psychological stress response in healthy adults.\nA small crossover trial in healthy male adults in France shows that taking either a specific saffron extract (Safr'Inside, Activ'Inside) 30 mg or synthetic safranal 0.06 mg as a single sublingual dose 15 minutes before undergoing the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) reduces self-reported stress and anxiety when compared with placebo (113711).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral saffron reduces ulcerative colitis symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults in Iran with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis who were taking a 5-aminosalicylic drug, with or without azathioprine, shows that adding saffron extract 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces disease activity when compared with placebo (105626).\nless\nVascular dementia. Oral saffron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in older adults with vascular dementia shows that taking 60 mg of a combination product containing saffron, ginkgo, and Panax ginseng three times daily for 16 weeks modestly improves scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and patient-reported quality of life when compared with placebo. However, ADAS-Cog scores were lower, on average, at baseline in the placebo group than in the treatment group, limiting the interpretation of these findings (111336). It is unclear if these effects are due to saffron, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate saffron for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSaffron extract is typically used in doses of 20-100 mg daily for up to 3 months. Larger doses of saffron powder 200-300 mg daily have been used for up to 10 days. The saffron constituent crocin is typically used in doses of 15-30 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost research has used saffron extracts (11024, 13103, 16555, 17401, 19032, 93395, 93397, 93400, 93401, 93407)(100135, 100137, 100138, 100141, 100658, 100659), although dried saffron has occasionally been used (19033, 19057, 93404, 93405, 93406, 99436). In clinical trials, saffron stigma has been donated by or purchased from specific companies in Iran, including Novin Saffron Co. (11024, 13103, 18102, 19032, 19057, 93404, 93409, 93410), Green Plants of Life Co. (16555, 17401, 93395, 93401, 93407, 100137, 100138, 100658), and East Sorkhfam Saffron Co. (93400). Pharmactive Biotech Products SL Company in Spain has also donated saffron stigma for clinical trials (97359, 100659, 103934, 103935).\n\nIn clinical trials, 80% ethanolic extracts have been shown to contain 0.13-0.15 mg safranal and/or 1.65-1.75 mg crocin per 15 mg extract (17401, 93395, 93401, 93407). Other ethanolic extracts have been shown to contain 0.3-0.35 mg safranal per 15 mg extract (17222, 19032). Aqueous extracts have also been used (93397, 93400). A saffron extract standardized to contain more than 3.5% Lepticrosalides, a trademarked combination of safranal and crocin isomers, has been used (97359, 100659, 103934, 103935). A specific saffron extract product (Safr'Inside, Activ'Inside) is standardized to contain >3% crocins, >1% picro-crocin derivatives, and >0.2% safranal (113711).\n\nThe highest quality saffron is made from the stigma of the plant. Premium grade saffron, containing only the red stigma tips, is known as \"sargol\" (93400, 93407, 100130, 100138). Lower grade saffron may contain more of the style. One pound of saffron requires approximately 225,000 hand-picked stigmas or 75,000 blossoms, making saffron extremely expensive compared to other spices (72385, 72389, 72467, 72513, 93400, 93407, 93408).",

Some of the patients in these studies were also taking antidiabetes drugs; however, it is unclear whether saffron further reduces fasting blood glucose levels in those already taking antidiabetes drugs (100138, 113499, 113723, 113731, 116077).\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of saffron with antihypertensive drugs might have additive effects.\nAnimal and human research suggests that saffron extract can decrease blood pressure (72518, 72365, 72473, 93409).\nless\nCAFFEINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, saffron might inhibit the metabolism of caffeine.\nA small clinical study suggests that taking saffron powder 300 mg in 150 mL water daily for 5 days and then taking caffeine 200 mg seems to reduce caffeine metabolite levels in the saliva and urine in males, but not females. Theoretically, this may be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 by saffron (100130).\nless\nCNS DEPRESSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of saffron and CNS depressants might have additive sedative effects.\nClinical research shows that taking saffron extract 60 mg orally daily for 26 weeks can cause drowsiness and sedation (18102).

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, saffron poisoning can occur with high doses of 5 grams or more (11). Symptoms of saffron poisoning include vertigo, numbness, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, hematuria, uremic collapse, bleeding, and thrombocytopenic purpura (2, 11). Saffron can be lethal when taken in doses of 12-20 grams (12, 18).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with saffron.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral intake of saffron in humans, levels of the constituent crocetin increase rapidly in the blood (100136). In animal research, the constituent crocetin was absorbed quickly following intragastric administration. Maximal blood levels occurred after 65 minutes (72363). The constituent crocin is metabolized to crocetin prior to gastrointestinal absorption (100136).\nDistribution\nCrocetin, a constituent of saffron, seems to be rapidly distributed to tissues in the body (100136).\nMetabolism\nCrocetin, a constituent of saffron, is metabolized in the liver to glucuronide conjugates (100136).\nExcretion\nCrocetin, a constituent of saffron, is excreted in urine. Crocin, a constituent of saffron, is excreted unmetabolized in feces (100136).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of saffron are the stigma and flower petals. The stigma is used much more extensively than the flower petals. Saffron spice comes from the flower stigma.\n\nThe primary constituents of saffron stigma include crocins, picrocrocin, and safranal (15193, 72441, 72567, 100136, 100141). The crocins are carotenoids, which give saffron its characteristic yellow-red color (15193, 15194). Alpha-crocin is the most abundant constituent; however, crocetin, the aglycone of crocin, appears to be most responsible for the pharmacological activities of saffron (72343). The stigma contains about 4% picrocrocin, which is responsible for the bitter taste of saffron (72343). Safranal makes up about 70% of the volatile oil and gives saffron its aroma (15193, 15194, 72441).\n\nOther constituents of saffron include the phenolic acids, such as tannic, gallic, caffeic, cinnamic, chlorogenic, ferulic, and vanillic acids (32482). The constituents of the saffron stigma undergo quantitative changes during development (72500). Storage and drying temperatures appear to modify levels of some saffron constituents; however, freeze-drying does not appear to negatively impact safranal levels (72383, 72395, 72399).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nIn human research, saffron seems to modestly improve asthma symptoms related to allergic asthma. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, possible activity includes antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and muscle relaxant effects, as shown mainly in animal models (100141).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research suggests that saffron, and its primary constituent crocin, reduce some markers of inflammation, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (111358, 113721, 113732, 113735, 116080). However, some clinical studies have found no change in hsCRP (113716). In males with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), crocin seems to reduce serum levels of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (113720).\nAnti-seizure effects\nSaffron is traditionally used for seizures. In an animal model, the constituent safranal reduced seizures. It is theorized that the mechanism for this activity is modification of the benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABA-A receptor complex (72407, 72421, 72478).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using saffron as an anticancer agent. Saffron extracts limit the in vitro growth of tumor colony cells by inhibiting cellular nucleic acid synthesis (4104, 4105). Laboratory research shows that saffron extract and constituents such as crocin have cytotoxic effects against various tumor cells (72341, 72445, 72454, 72477, 72540) and can inhibit tumor growth (15193). In animal models, saffron extract applied topically or taken orally appears to inhibit experimentally induced skin cancer (15193). The anti-cancer effects of saffron are likely related to its constituent carotenoids. In animal research, crocetin inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth (72491), possibly through an antioxidant mechanism (72420). Saffron extracts appear to protect against DNA damage (72377, 72386, 72476), possibly by modulating phase II detoxifying enzymes like glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (72380). Saffron extracts also induce apoptosis via the Bax-regulated pathway (72485, 72499).\nAnticoagulant effects\nLaboratory research has identified saffron constituents that can influence bleeding time and platelet aggregation. However, in clinical research, taking saffron 200 mg or 400 mg daily for 7 days does not alter bleeding time or affect levels of fibrinogen, proteins C and S, or factor VII compared to placebo (72525, 72566, 93396). The lack of effect may be related to the presence of constituents in saffron that both induce and inhibit platelet aggregation (72525).\nAntidepressant effects\nSaffron has been traditionally used in the treatment of depression and has shown benefit in clinical research (11024, 13103, 19032, 72434, 93399, 93402, 93404, 93410, 113709, 113727). Saffron extract has also been shown to improve negative mood, anxiety, and stress when compared with placebo (100659, 113727). In animal research, the antidepressant effects of saffron were thought to be due to crocin (72514); however, other constituents cannot be ruled out (93399). It has been suggested that saffron might modulate levels of brain serotonin, possibly by inhibiting serotonin reuptake (93399, 93404, 105621). It has also been suggested that crocin in saffron reduces depression by inhibiting uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (93404, 93410, 113727). However, evidence supporting this mechanism is lacking.\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using oral saffron to improve glycemic control. However, clinical research findings are conflicting as to whether saffron or crocin, a primary constituent of saffron, improves glycemic control in adults with diabetes or prediabetes (99436, 100138, 100139, 103936, 108905, 113499, 113716, 113719, 113723, 113731, 116077). Research in animal models suggests that any hypoglycemic effects of saffron and crocin are due to improvements in insulin secretion, reductions in insulin resistance, reduced oxidation of pancreatic beta-cells, and improvements in structure and function of pancreatic tissue (72422, 72465, 113734). Clinical research suggests that taking saffron extract reduces the increase in fasting blood sugar commonly seen with antipsychotic agents (93397).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere has been interest in using saffron supplementation to mitigate oxidative stress. Clinical research in adults with a wide range of chronic health issues shows that taking saffron decreases malondialdehyde levels and increases total antioxidant capacity when compared with placebo or no supplementation (108906, 113719, 113720). However, other clinical studies have found no change in markers of oxidative stress with the use of saffron (113716, 113735).\nAnxiolytic effects\nSaffron has been traditionally used in the treatment of anxiety. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking saffron improves symptoms in patients with mild to moderate anxiety (93404, 113727). In animal research, anxiolytic effects of saffron were possibly associated with the constituents safranal and crocin (72472, 72489). It has been suggested that crocin is involved in reducing neuronal excitability and modulating the activity of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (113727). A small crossover study in healthy males shows that a single dose of sublingual saffron may delay the response to acute experimental stress, extending the time to peak salivary cortisol and cortisone but without a reduction in maximum levels (113711).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that crocetin, the aglycone of crocin, might have cardiovascular activity. In addition, crocetin binds to albumin, potentially increasing oxygen diffusion and improving atherosclerosis (4109). Antioxidant effects of crocetin may also play a role in reducing oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (72412, 72561). Some clinical research shows that saffron or its constituent, crocin, decreases levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (113721); however, other clinical research has not identified these effects (100139, 113716). The antioxidant effects of crocetin might also protect the vascular smooth muscle cells from proliferation (72455). Finally, there is some speculation that saffron extract may inhibit calcium channels, as suggested by negative inotropic and chronotropic activity in an isolated guinea-pig heart in one study (72456).\nChemoprotective effects\nSaffron might protect against toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. In animal research, saffron extract, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, prolonged lifespan and prevented cisplatin-induced liver and kidney toxicity, as well as decreases in body weight, hemoglobin levels, and leukocyte counts (36299, 72466, 72523). Crocetin, a saffron constituent, has been shown to protect against bladder toxicity induced by cyclophosphamide in mice (72539).\nErectile dysfunction protective effects\nThere is conflicting evidence in humans regarding the use of saffron or its constituents for erectile dysfunction (19057, 93408, 93409). In animal research, the constituent crocin increases mounting and erection frequency and reduces the time to ejaculation, whereas safranal does not show these effects (72453). The constituent crocetin is thought to enhance the production of vascular nitric oxide, a key factor during erection (93408).\nErgogenic effects\nSaffron is thought to increase the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise, resulting in increased time to exhaustion. It is postulated that this is related to increased muscle metabolism and/or neuronal function (93406). In human research, saffron extract appears to protect against muscle damage, reducing levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (93405).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSmall amounts of saffron have been shown to stimulate gastric secretions (18).\nHepatic effects\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in patients with diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and other conditions shows that taking saffron 30-100 mg daily or crocin 5-20 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not affect liver transaminase levels when compared with control (105619, 113716).The analyses are limited by imprecise and inconsistent point estimates, as well as the poor quality of the included studies. However, other clinical research, including that in patients with diabetes, suggests saffron and crocin may slightly reduce levels of alanine transaminase and/or aspartate aminotransferase (113723, 116698).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIt is unclear if saffron has hypolipidemic effects. Some clinical research shows that saffron or its constituent, crocin, decreases levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (113721); however, other clinical research has not identified these effects (100139, 113716). Both saffron and its constituent crocin have demonstrated hypolipidemic effects in animal models (72394, 72508).\nHypotensive effects\nAnimal and some human research suggests that saffron can decrease blood pressure (72518, 72365, 72473, 93409). Crocin and safranal may be at least partially responsible for this effect (72518).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSaffron is thought to have immunomodulating effects. In laboratory research, saffron stimulates the proliferation of T cells (93403). However, other laboratory research shows that the constituent crocin inhibits the activation of T cells (72384). In an animal model, saffron prevented an autoimmune response. It has been suggested that the carotenoid constituents of saffron might protect immune cells from oxidative damage. In human research, saffron extract increased levels of IgG and decreased levels of IgM (93403). This suggests that saffron constituents might have immunomodulatory effects.\nMemory-enhancing effects\nSaffron is traditionally used to improve memory. Animal research suggests that saffron extract might improve memory retrieval (72429, 72448, 72544).\nNeuroprotective effects\nSaffron is used traditionally to improve memory and has been investigated to reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (93395). In animal research, crocin improves learning and memory after ethanol consumption and protects N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor responses by a mechanism likely involving antioxidant effects (72397, 72428, 72439, 72505, 72556, 93395). Constituents of saffron have been shown to have protective antioxidant effects in animal models, possibly involving inhibition of a G protein-coupled receptor (72411, 72444). Some clinical research shows that saffron extract improves symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (17401, 93395). In laboratory research, the constituents trans-crocin-4 and dimethylcrocetin have been shown to inhibit Amyloid beta-protein fibrillogenesis, a key pathological factor in Alzheimer's disease (72436).\nOcular protective effects\nSaffron extract is of interest for the protection of ocular photoreceptors from degeneration. In animal research, the constituents crocin and crocetin have been shown to protect photoreceptor morphology and function and protect against apoptosis (72425, 72459, 93398).\nSmooth muscle effects\nLarge amounts of saffron appear to stimulate uterine smooth muscle, contributing to abortifacient affects (18).\nTyrosinase inhibitory effects\nTyrosinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of pigments from tyrosine. Some saffron constituents have demonstrated tyrosinase inhibitory effects in laboratory research. These include kaempferol, isolated from saffron flower petals (15192), as well as crocins and crousatins (72359)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Sage refers to several plants from the genus Salvia, which comprises about 900 different species (91968, 91969). Two species commonly used as traditional remedies are common sage (Salvia officinalis) and Spanish sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia), which are perennial shrubs native to the Mediterranean region and Middle East (91968, 91969, 108962). Traditionally, sage has been used for digestive problems, respiratory conditions, skin conditions, galactorrhea, hyperhidrosis, and depression.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Sage is approved for use as a food in the United States (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in medicinal doses, short-term. Common sage (Salvia officinalis) and Spanish sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia) have been used with apparent safety when taken orally in doses of 280 mg daily for up to 8 weeks (10334, 10810, 17177, 105338). ...when used topically. Common sage (Salvia officinalis) has been used with apparent safety as a single agent or in combination products for up to one week (10437, 72619, 107023). ...when the essential oil is inhaled as aromatherapy, short-term (72658).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses or long-term (12, 1304). Some species of sage, including common sage (Salvia officinalis), contain a thujone constituent that can be toxic if consumed in large enough quantities (12, 1304).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. The constituent thujone can have menstrual stimulant and abortifacient effects (19).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally; sage is thought to reduce the supply of mother's milk (19).",

Sage extract can cause burning and pain (10437).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, sage can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (10810, 17177).\n\nTopically, sage extract sprayed into the mouth and throat can cause dryness or mild burning of the throat (72619).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, sage can cause dizziness or agitation (10810, 17177). Thujone, a constituent of common sage (Salvia officinalis), is a neurotoxin and can cause seizures (10812, 12868). Camphor and cineol, constituents of common sage and Spanish sage, can also cause neurotoxicity and seizures in high doses (10334, 12868). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures have been reported in adults, children, and infants after ingestion of sage oil (12868, 72666).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, sage can cause wheezing (10810, 17177).\n\nOccupational exposure to sage dust can cause reduction in ventilatory capacity and chronic respiratory impairment (72672, 72682, 72686).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral sage seems to be beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy adults. The benefits of sage aromatherapy are unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific product providing common sage polyphenols and Spanish sage terpenoids (Cognivia), either as a single dose or daily for 29 days, modestly improves working memory and accuracy when compared with placebo. A single dose of this product contains common sage leaf extract 400 mg and Spanish sage essential oil 200 mg (105337). In addition, preliminary clinical research shows that Spanish sage essential oil 25-50 mcL orally as a single dose seems to dose-dependently enhance some measures of cognitive performance in young adults by a small amount (10811, 72609, 72616, 72660).\n\nWhen used as aromatherapy, essential oils of common sage, but not Spanish sage, seem to improve quality of memory and secondary memory. Neither species improves speed of memory or working memory when used as aromatherapy. In this study, five drops of common sage essential oil and 5 mL water were placed on a warmed stone and allowed to diffuse for 5 minutes prior to exposure (72658).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral sage seems to be beneficial for reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\nClinical research in adults with mixed hyperlipidemia types shows that taking common sage leaf extract 500 mg, standardized to quercetin 2.16%, three times daily for 2 months reduces LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels by about 20% and 23%, respectively, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 20%, when compared with placebo (72662). Also, preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia shows that taking common sage leaf extract 500 mg three times daily for 3 months lowers total cholesterol by 17%, LDL cholesterol by 36%, and triglycerides by 56%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 28%, when compared with placebo (91971).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral sage seems to be beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking a thujone-free common sage extract (Menosan, A.Vogel AG) 280 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces overall symptoms of menopause by 39% when compared with placebo. About 41% of patients taking common sage had at least a 50% reduction in symptoms, compared with 8% of those taking placebo. Hot flushes, sleep problems, joint and muscle discomfort, irritability, and physical and mental exhaustion were improved, whereas urogenital symptoms such as sexual desire and vaginal dryness were not (105338). Other clinical research shows that taking common sage extract 300 mg daily for 3 months moderately reduces overall symptoms of menopause after about 10 weeks when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on vaginal dryness, physical and mental exhaustion, or urinary incontinence (103379). Another small clinical study shows that taking a specific thujone-free common sage extract (Sage Menopause, Bioforce AG) 280 mg daily for 56 days reduces daily hot flash frequency by 40% and reduces hot flash intensity when compared with baseline (17177). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nPostoperative pain. Using an oral rinse containing common sage does not seem to be beneficial for reducing postoperative pain.\nA large open-label clinical trial in children and adults shows that using a common sage oral rinse 6 times daily in combination with ibuprofen or diclofenac is less effective than benzydamine hydrochloride, a local anesthetic, for reducing pain following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Furthermore, treatment with common sage oral rinse is associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection in adults when compared with benzydamine hydrochloride (72700).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if a single oral dose of common sage is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nClinical research in healthy, older adults shows that taking a single dose of common sage extract 333 mg improves accuracy of attention and some measures of memory when compared with placebo. However, not all doses were effective and some measures of cognitive function were not affected (72642).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for Alzheimer disease.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking extracts of common sage and Spanish sage orally seems to improve cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease when used for up to 4 months (10334, 10810). In one study, a fixed dose of common sage hydroalcoholic extract, equivalent to 1 gram of sage per day, was used for 4 months (10810). In the other, an extract of Spanish sage titrated up to 2.5 mg three times daily for 6 weeks was used (10334). These studies are limited by their short duration and small numbers of participants.\nless\nAndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT)-associated hot flashes. It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for ADT-associated hot flashes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT shows that taking common sage extract 150 mg three times daily with meals for 4 weeks reduces hot flash severity by 48% and hot flash frequency by 42% when compared with baseline. These improvements were maintained with an additional 8 weeks of treatment (91970). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nIn young, healthy, physically active adults, taking a specific supplement (Cognivia, Nexira) containing 400 mg common sage leaf extract and 200 mg Spanish sage oil, orally 2 hours prior to a 40-minute stationary cycling session at 80% of maximum aerobic power, lowers perceived exertion scores and improves working memory and reaction times when compared with placebo (108961).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if topical sage is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of CINV.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing chemotherapy shows that using common sage oil 2 mL topically during 15-minute sessions of Swedish abdominal massage twice daily for 3 days modestly reduces nausea severity scores, but does not affect vomiting frequency, when compared with massage alone (107023).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sage is beneficial for reducing plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that rinsing the mouth with 10-15 mL of a solution containing common sage, twice for 30 seconds four times daily for 4 days, in addition to standard oral care with brushing and use of an oral gel (Biotene), is as effective as normal saline for reducing dental plaque. However, there was no effect on tongue plaque. The rinse was made by steeping 2.5 grams of dried sage leaf in 100 mL boiled water for two minutes (105339).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for diabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking common sage leaf extract 500 mg three times daily for 3 months lowers fasting blood glucose by 32% and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 23% when compared with placebo (91971). However, another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking common sage extract 150 mg three times daily for 3 months does not lower fasting blood glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo, although there is a modest reduction in 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels (105340). A meta-analysis of 3 small studies, including the 2 described above, shows that taking common sage, 150-500 mg three times daily for 2-3 months, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels, as well as HbA1c, when compared with placebo (108962). These studies were all conducted in Iran; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with common sage is beneficial for dry mouth.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients receiving palliative cancer care shows that rinsing the mouth with 10-15 mL of a solution containing common sage, twice for 30 seconds four times daily for 4 days, in conjunction with standard care involving brushing and an oral gel (Biotene), is as effective as normal saline for improving overall oral health and modestly more effective than normal saline for improving dry mouth. The rinse was made by steeping 2.5 grams dried sage leaf in 100 mL boiled water for two minutes (105339).\nless\nGingivitis. Sage has only been evaluated as a mouthwash in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in elderly individuals shows that rinsing the mouth with a mouthwash containing sage, marshmallow, calendula, tormentil, horse chestnut, neem, and myrrh, once daily for 30 seconds for 6 weeks, is no more effective than placebo for improving plaque and gingival bleeding (105341).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). It is unclear if topical sage is beneficial for herpes labialis.\nClinical research shows that topical application of a cream containing either sage alone or sage with rhubarb, starting within 1 day of the first symptoms and continuing for 10-14 days, heals herpes labialis legions in 7.6 days or 6.7 days, respectively, compared to a healing time of 6.3 days with acyclovir cream. The combination of sage and rhubarb also improves the time to healing and reduces pain when compared with sage alone. The cream provided 23 mg sage extract, with or without 23 mg rhubarb extract, per gram and was applied every 2-4 hours while awake (10437).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if dietary sage is beneficial for lung cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that regularly consuming sage is associated with a 54% lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with those who do not use sage as a spice (72593).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sage is beneficial for oral mucositis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients receiving palliative cancer care shows that rinsing the mouth with 10-15 mL of a rinse containing common sage, twice for 30 seconds four times daily for 4 days, in addition to standard oral care with brushing and use of an oral gel (Biotene), does not improve oral mucositis when compared with baseline or normal saline rinse. The rinse was made by steeping 2.5 grams of dried sage leaf in 100 mL boiled water for two minutes (105339).\nless\nPharyngitis. It is unclear if inhaling a spray containing sage, with or without other ingredients, is beneficial for pharyngitis.\nClinical research in patients with acute viral pharyngitis shows that inhaling three puffs (140 mcL) of a specific spray (Valverde Salvia Rachenspray) containing common sage extract 15%, six to nine times daily for 3 days, reduces throat pain intensity over 2 hours when compared with placebo. However, sprays containing common sage extract 5% or 30% do not seem to be more effective than placebo for reducing throat pain (72619). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with sore throat due to acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis shows that applying a combination spray product containing common sage leaf tincture 430 mg/mL, Echinacea flowering aerial parts tincture 863.3 mg/mL, and Echinacea root tincture 45.5 mg/mL, every 2 hours up to 10 times daily for up to 5 consecutive days improves symptoms as effectively as a chlorhexidine-lidocaine spray (20077).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for PCOS.\nClinical research shows that taking common sage extract 330 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, and modestly improves measures of insulin resistance, when compared with placebo in individuals with PCOS. However, there was no effect on waist to hip ratio or systolic blood pressure (103380).\nless\nSunburn. It is unclear if topical sage is beneficial for sunburn prevention.\nClinical research shows that a single application of a hydrophilic ointment containing common sage extract 2% to the skin immediately after exposure to ultraviolet light reduces the development of skin redness when compared with placebo (72638).\nless\nSwallowing dysfunction. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sage is beneficial for swallowing dysfunction.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients receiving palliative cancer care shows that rinsing the mouth with 10-15 mL of a solution containing common sage, twice for 30 seconds four times daily for 4 days, in addition to standard oral care with brushing and use of an oral gel (Biotene), does not improve swallowing when compared with baseline or normal saline rinse. The rinse was made by steeping 2.5 grams of dried sage leaf in 100 mL boiled water for two minutes (105339).\nless\nTonsillitis. Sage has only been evaluated in a spray in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with sore throat due to acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis shows that applying a combination spray product containing common sage leaf tincture 430 mg/mL, Echinacea flowering aerial parts tincture 863.3 mg/mL, and Echinacea root tincture 45.5 mg/mL, every 2 hours up to 10 times daily for up to 5 consecutive days improves symptoms as effectively as a chlorhexidine-lidocaine spray (20077).\nless\nTonsillopharyngitis. It is unclear if oral sage is beneficial for treating tonsillopharyngitis.\nA moderate-sized observational study in patients aged 12-75 years old with acute tonsillopharyngitis suggests that taking lozenges containing sage extract 378.5 mg and echinacea extract 5 times daily for 4 days reduces throat pain and tonsillopharyngitis symptoms when compared to baseline, both acutely within 90 minutes and after 4 days of treatment (111530). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to sage, echinacea, the combination, or natural resolution of the condition.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate sage for these uses.",

Tell patients to discontinue using high doses of common sage at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures. Common sage (Salvia officinalis) might affect blood glucose levels (10813, 25526, 67226, 71783, 72614, 72626, 91971, 103380).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nCommon sage (Salvia officinalis) contains thujone, which can be toxic if consumed in large quantities (12, 1304). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hepatotoxicity have been associated with the thujone, camphor, and/or cineol constituents of sage (10334, 10812, 12868, 72666).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with sage.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research suggests that rosmarinic acid, a constituent of sage, is poorly absorbed across the intestines (72612). Several sage monoterpenoids, including limonene and alpha-pinene, might penetrate the skin after topical application (72773).\nMetabolism\nAlpha- and beta-thujone, constituents of sage, are metabolized in the liver to 7-hydroxy-alpha-thujone, 4-hydroxy-alpha-thujone, 4-hydroxy-beta-thujone, and 7,8-dehydro-alpha-thujone (72708). The hydroxylated metabolites are susceptible to glucuronidation.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of sage is the leaf and volatile oil. Sage contains 1-2.8% of volatile oil. The volatile oil contains several pharmacologically active constituents, including camphor, 1,8-cineole, alpha- and beta-pinene, bornyl acetate, geraniol, limonene, camphene, linalool, alpha-terpineol, gamma-terpinene, alpha-humulene, beta-caryophyllene, rosmarinic acid, carvacrol, luteolin, and cirsiliol (10334, 39566, 72582, 72719, 105337). Sage leaf contains rosmarinic acid, apigenin glucosides, and luteolin glucosides (105337). Sage is also a rich source of beta-carotene (19).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that ursolic acid from sage has anti-inflammatory effects when applied topically (72580). Intraperitoneally, sage tincture appears to reduce inflammation by inhibiting nitric oxide synthesis (72637). Various in vitro studies have also reported anti-inflammatory effects of sage constituents. Alpha-pinene and gerniol appear to inhibit eicosanoid in fat leukocytes (39572). Carnosic acid and carnosol appear to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and suppress pro-inflammatory responses of stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (71832). Carnosic acid also appears to prevent the migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 production and activity (71824). Borneol appears to decrease interleukin (IL)-1beta and (IL)-6 expression (36187).\nAntibacterial effects\nSage extracts and the sage constituent salvin have shown antibacterial activity against various species of Staphylococcus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei (71810, 72636, 72669, 72670, 72674). Carnosol from sage has been shown to potentiate the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (72631). Sage has also been shown to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni in vitro (36131, 49487).\n\nThere is mixed evidence regarding the antibacterial effects of sage on oral bacteria. Some in vitro research shows that sage extracts have modest antimicrobial effects against strains of bacteria in saliva samples from healthy volunteers or patients with chronic periodontitis (43424, 48587). These strains of bacteria include Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Candida albicans (48587). Other in vitro research shows that sage inhibits collagenolytic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis against human gingival fibroblasts; however, cytotoxic effects against this species were lacking (72624). Sage tea or sage extract did not affect colony-forming microbes in the mouth (72572, 72611, 72693).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that sage extract and the sage constituent rosmarinic acid can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in colorectal and renal cell adenocarcinoma cell lines (33837, 72654).\n\nEvidence from animal research suggests that beta-ursolic acid, a constituent of sage, can inhibit melanoma cells from metastasizing to and colonizing the lungs of mice. This effect was attributed to the ability of beta-ursolic acid to inhibit protease activity (72632).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the antimutagenic effects of sage. Some animal research suggests that terpenoid fractions of sage can decrease the frequency of aberrant cells induced by mitomycin C (72608). However, antimutagenic effects were not noted in other research (72766).\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that sage extract, but not sage essential oil, can reduce serum glucose in diabetic rats (72614). Various mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the antidiabetic effects of sage. Some in vitro evidence suggests that sage tea can inhibit gluconeogenesis and increase insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes from healthy rats. However, it does not appear to have these effects in hepatocytes from diabetic rats (72626). Other evidence from in vitro research suggests that sage can stimulate insulin-dependent utilization of glucose (10813). Other in vitro research suggests that sage extracts containing phenolic diterpene constituents can activate peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR)-gamma (71783). Evidence from other in vitro research shows that sage extracts containing rosmarinic acid can inhibit alpha-glucosidase activity (67226).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research suggests that sage extract has modest antifungal activity against Candida albicans (72644).\nAntilipemic effects\nIn human research, sage tea lowered plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol and elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels after 2 weeks of treatment (72655, 72662); however, the mechanism of action is not well understood.\nAntioxidant activity\nEvidence from animal research suggests that sage tea consumption protects against lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) depletion (72610) and enhances glutathione-S-transferase activity (72627). In vitro research shows that sage extract increases GSH content (67252), while sage essential oil as well as sage extract reduces lipid peroxidation (71810, 72649). Rosmarinic acid, carvacrol, and luteolin have antioxidant properties (10334, 68661). Carnosic acid, alpha- and beta-pinene, and 1,8-cineol have also shown antioxidant effects in vitro (39572, 71692, 71704, 72591). However, sage also contains camphor, which has pro-oxidant effects and is associated with hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity at high doses (10334).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro, the sage constituents caffeic acid and salvianolic acids have shown antileishmanial activity against intracellular amastigote stages of Leishmania parasites within macrophage-like cells (72592). The antiparasitic effects may have been due to the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 from the cultured cells. Increased interferon-like activity was also suggested.\nAntiviral activity\nIn vitro research shows that sage extracts can reduce the absorption of herpes simplex virus (68447, 72640). However, sage extract does not appear to reduce intracellular replication of herpes simplex virus (68447). In vitro, sage aqueous extracts have been found to reduce the infection of HIV-1 and enhance the density of the virus needed for surface engagement (68471). An observational study suggests that sage reduces viral shedding when combined with echinacea extract (111530).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn animal research, rosmarinic acid, a constituent of sage, produced anxiolytic-like effects in lower doses (72613).\nBone effects\nIn animal research, sage, sage essential oils, and monoterpene essential oil components, including thujone, eucalyptol, camphor, borneol, thymol, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, bornyl acetate, and menthol, were found to inhibit bone resorption when added to the food of rats (71716).\nCardiovascular effects\nIntravenous and duodenal administration of an aqueous-alcohol extract of sage appears to lower blood pressure in cats (4152).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn an animal ulcer model, a hydroalcoholic extract of sage has been shown to reduce ethanol-induced ulcers, possibly by reducing the acidity of gastric secretions or by inhibiting H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity (72651).\nHepatoprotective effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that drinking sage tea can increase liver glutathione-S-transferase activity and protect against lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion (72610). Other animal research shows that sage extract can protect the liver from azathioprine-induced acute damage (71760). In vitro research shows that sage extract can protect liver cells from damage due to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (72633).\nHormonal effects\nEvidence from preliminary research shows that sage extract increases prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in menopausal women. However, it does not appear to affect levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone (72695). The constituent geraniol exerts estrogenic activity (10334, 39572).\nInsecticidal effects\nThe methanol extract of sage exhibited larval toxicity to the third instar larvae of Egyptian cottonworm (Spodoptera littoralis) (72607).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nCirsiliol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Linalool and alpha-terpineol have CNS depressant activity (10334).\n\nIn addition to CNS depressant effects, linalool and alpha-terpineol have anticholinesterase activity (10334). Other constituents with anticholinesterase activity are 1,8-cineole, alpha-pinene, and caryophyllene epoxide (10334, 39566, 72771). Animal studies of sage have also shown anticholinesterase activity (10334, 72770). The potential for sage to improve memory and cognitive performance has been attributed to its anticholinesterase activity (10811, 31438, 39566, 59324, 59354, 72603, 72616, 72618, 72642). Furthermore, in vitro research shows that essential oil of sage can inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (72603, 72616). The ability of sage and sage essential oil constituents to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase suggest it has potential for treating Alzheimer disease. Furthermore, in vitro research suggests that rosmarinic acid from sage can protect pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from amyloid-beta peptide-induced neurotoxicity (72617). This indicates another mechanism by which sage may protect against Alzheimer disease.\n\nThujone, a constituent of some sage species, exhibits convulsant activity. Common sage (Salvia officinalis) contains significant amounts of thujone. The thujone concentration of the volatile oil varies from 17% to 58%, depending on growing conditions, season of harvest, and other variables (10812). Spanish sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia) contains only trace amounts of thujone (10334)."

However, Saigon cinnamon contains coumarin, which has been linked with adverse effects. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) level for coumarin in foods of 0.1 mg/kg, which is about 7 mg of coumarin daily for a person weighing 70 kg (154 lbs). Saigon cinnamon contains coumarin at a concentration of about 7 mg/gram (92558). Therefore, a person weighing approximately 70 kg should avoid using Saigon cinnamon in foods in amounts greater than 1 gram daily (about 0.25 tsp).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in higher doses, long-term. Saigon cinnamon contains higher levels of coumarin than other cinnamon species (92558). Coumarin has been shown to cause hepatotoxicity in animal models (15299, 21920). In humans, very high doses of coumarin from 50-7000 mg/day can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin use is discontinued (15302). In most cases, ingestion of Saigon cinnamon will not provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity. A person weighing 70 kg would need to take approximately 7 grams of Saigon cinnamon daily to obtain doses of coumarin of 50 mg daily. However, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease, prolonged ingestion of large amounts of Saigon cinnamon might exacerbate the condition.\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Saigon cinnamon when used orally in smaller medicinal amounts.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of salacia are the root and stem. The water-soluble portion of a methanol extract of salacia contains salacinol, mangiferin, and kotalanol, along with other flavonoids and tannins (13034, 13512, 13515, 15572, 72853).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSalacia is traditionally used for inflammatory illnesses such as joint inflammation. Salacia root bark powder seems to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (13035).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSalacia is traditionally used for diabetes. In animal and human research, salacia has been shown to reduce blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (13508, 72775, 72863, 72868, 72878, 72879, 72881, 112340). Salacia and some of its constituents have been shown to have antidiabetic effects in laboratory research. The constituents salacinol and kotalanol seem to inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the intestinal brush border, as well as intestinal aldose reductase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase (13034, 13510, 15572). Salacinol and kotalanol are more potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors than acarbose (Precose) (13510). Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase decreases the breakdown of carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides and therefore decreases postprandial blood glucose levels, as shown in both animals and humans (13032, 13033, 13507, 15572). In animals, the constituent mangiferin regulated gluconeogenesis in the liver (72835) and increased uptake of glucose into the muscle (72844).\n\nSalacia extract might also reduce complications related to diabetes. In animal models of diabetes, salacia extract seems to decrease cardiac and renal fibrosis (13033, 72846). Mangiferin and other salacia constituents also appear to inhibit aldose reductase, which might prevent some neurological and ophthalmological complications of diabetes (13514, 13515).\nHepatic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that salacia might improve hepatic steatosis. The salacia constituent, mangiferin, seems to enhance expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, a nuclear receptor that helps regulate lipid utilization and storage, lipoprotein metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, and insulin activity (13509, 72797). Other preliminary research suggests salacia root and stem extracts might have hepatoprotective antioxidant activity (13513).\nLipid effects\nLaboratory research suggests that salacia might improve postprandial hyperlipidemia. The salacia constituent, mangiferin, seems to enhance expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, a nuclear receptor that helps regulate lipid utilization and storage, lipoprotein metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation (13509, 72797).\nWeight loss effects\nSalacia is marketed as a \"starch blocker.\" Research using animal models suggests that salacia might help reduce body weight (13119, 13512, 72845, 72852, 112340, 112341) The constituent mangiferin might enhance lipolysis. Other salacia constituents such as catechins and tannins might also have anti-obesity effects by reducing weight gain (13119, 13512, 72845, 72852)."

This has led some researchers to question the reportedly reduced caloric value of salatrim. Some evidence suggests that short-chain fatty acids in salatrim increase stearoyl density, which reduces the digestibility of stearic acid and limits its available fat content (91003). However, other evidence shows that, in humans, the apparent absorption of stearic acid from salatrim is similar to the absorption of stearic acid from natural fats (91002).\nExcretion\nIn humans, some stearic acid from salatrim is excreted in the feces due to its limited digestibility (91002, 91003).",

            "Overview": "Salvia divinorum is an hallucinogenic plant native to central Mexico. It is traditionally used by the Mazatec people (72920, 100002). However, it has become popular amongst adolescents as a hallucinogen (100001, 100002). Although it is grown legally in some parts of the United States, Salvia divinorum is a \"drug of concern\" according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) (100001). The growth and use of Salvia divinorum is prohibited in various countries (15820, 15821, 72901, 100001).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally or by inhalation. Salvia divinorum contains a potent hallucinogen and has been shown to cause serious adverse effects including slurred speech, confusion, paranoia, depersonalization, blunted affect, hallucinations, and psychosis (7350, 7351, 15820, 15821, 72901, 100001, 100002).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally or by inhalation, Salvia divinorum can cause hallucinogenic effects. These include restlessness, hyperactivity, disorientation, loss of coordination, dizziness, slurred speech, altered perceptions, changes in perception of body temperature, personal detachment or distorted body ownership, fatigue, severe mood changes, and psychosis. Most of these effects resolve within 20 minutes; however, some effects might last longer (7350, 7351, 15820, 72901, 100001, 100002).\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, Salvia divinorum can cause nausea (7350).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nNeurologic changes caused by Salvia divinorum are rapid, intense, and short-lived. Most evidence suggests a peak effect within 2 minutes following consumption by smoking, with a slower peak when consumed orally. Most symptoms cease within 20 minutes; however, the 'high' can last as long as 2 hours. Symptoms include headache, restlessness, hyperactivity, disorientation, loss of coordination, dizziness, slurred speech, altered perceptions, including auditory, visual, tactile, and kinesthetic hallucinations, a feeling of being pinned to the floor, changes in perception of body temperature, personal detachment or distorted body ownership, and fatigue. These effects are not sustained and follow-up assessments weeks later usually show no lasting negative effects (7350, 7351, 15820, 100001, 100002).\nless\nPsychiatric\nPsychiatric changes caused by Salvia divinorum are rapid, intense, and short-lived. Most evidence suggests a peak effect within 2 minutes following consumption by smoking, with a slower peak when consumed orally. Most symptoms cease within 20 minutes; however, the 'high' can last as long as 2 hours. Symptoms include disturbed reality and mood changes including both euphoria or extreme happiness and severe anxiety, fear, or panic (72901, 100001, 100002). Rarely, the use of Salvia divinorum has been associated with both acute and chronic psychotic episodes. Whether Salvia divinorum use was directly responsible for these episodes is not yet clear. Some individuals were using cannabis or other recreational drugs concurrently and/or were possibly at increased risk of schizophrenia. However, these risk factors were not consistent, and the episodes occurred following the use of Salvia divinorum in all cases (100002). Salvia divinorum appears to have a low potential for abuse (100001).\nless",

When swallowed, salvinorin A is inactivated by the gastrointestinal system. When the heated vapors are inhaled, salvinorin A is rapidly absorbed (7352). The onset of hallucinogenic activity occurs within 5 to 10 minutes when chewed and within 30 seconds when inhaled (7352). Peak hallucinogenic activity is reported within 1-2 minutes after inhalation (106679).\nExcretion\nSalvinorin A, the psychoactive constituent of Salvia divinorum, is excreted in the urine (72904, 100002).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of salvia divinorum is the leaf. The leaves are chewed and swallowed, made into an infusion (tea), or smoked for hallucinogenic effects. The active constituent is the diterpene salvinorin A, which is also called divinorin A. Unlike other hallucinogens, salvinorin A is not an alkaloid, but a neoclerodane diterpene (7350, 7351, 7352, 100002).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nIn an animal intestinal model, the activation of kappa-opioid receptors by salvinorin A is likely responsible for the reduced cholinergic transmission associated with Salvia divinorum (72914).\nNeurological effects\nSalvinorin A, a constituent in Salvia divinorum, is the most potent known hallucinogen. It causes hallucinations in doses of 200 mcg to 500 mcg when vaporized and inhaled (7351). Salvinorin A is thought to cause hallucinations through kappa-opioid receptor agonist activity (15819, 72894). Most research indicates that it does not appear to affect receptor sites such as mu- and delta-opioid receptors, or serotonin, dopamine, or monoamine oxidase that are often affected by other hallucinogens (7352, 15819, 15820, 72890, 100002). However, some research in animals suggests that dopamine or kappa-opioid receptors might be involved (100002, 106678).\n\nThe onset of hallucinogenic activity occurs within 5-10 minutes when chewed and within 30 seconds when inhaled. The effects last about an hour when chewed and 20-45 minutes via inhalation (7352, 106679). However, the duration of effect appears to be dose-dependent (7351). In humans, the hallucinogenic effects of Salvia divinorum are sometimes accompanied by increases in cortisol (100002).\n\nThere is also interest in using salvia divinorum for the treatment of depression and addiction. Preliminary research in adults with a history of hallucinogen use shows that inhalation of salvinorin A 15 mcg/kg affects the brain default mode network to increase functional entropy. This activity is thought to be beneficial in treating depression and addiction (106679). However, in rats undergoing alcohol withdrawal, intraperitoneal injection of salvia divinorum leaf extract 1 mL/kg or salvinorin A 1 mg/kg daily for 7 days increases alcohol consumption, decreases food consumption, and increases anxiety/fear responses when compared with control (106678)."

    "SAMe": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "SAMe is formed naturally in the body from homocysteine and 5-methylene tetrahydrofolate (17490). It functions as a primary methyl group donor, and contributes to the synthesis, activation, and metabolism of hormones, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and some drugs (5231, 5232, 9110, 95076). It was discovered in 1952 by Cantoni in Italy, and is used as a prescription drug in Italy, Spain, and Germany (9100, 73055, 95075, 95076).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly and appropriately. Serious adverse effects have not been reported in multiple clinical studies involving more than 22,000 patients and lasting from a few days to 2 years (5189, 5201, 5202, 5219, 5231, 5232, 12231, 17490, 95075, 95076)(115768).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used intravenously short-term during the third trimester of pregnancy. In two small-scale trials, SAMe 800 mg daily was used intravenously for 14-20 days during the third trimester of pregnancy for cholestasis. No adverse effects were observed (5219, 5231, 5240). However, use of SAMe in pregnancy should only be considered when benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. There is insufficient reliable information available about the use of SAMe at higher doses, for extended periods of time, or during the earlier trimesters of pregnancy.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, SAMe is generally well tolerated when used in typical doses. Side effects are more common with higher doses.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, flatulence, headache, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, sweating, vomiting.\nCardiovascular\nThere has been some concern that SAMe might increase homocysteine levels. SAMe is metabolized to s-adenosylhomocysteine, which can be metabolized to homocysteine (5232). Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to cardiovascular and kidney disease (1698). However, in a study lasting 4 weeks, administration of SAMe orally in doses titrated up to 1600 mg daily was not associated with a significant increase in homocysteine levels (12231). In another study, there also was no difference in cardiovascular mortality in people with cirrhosis taking SAMe 1200 mg daily for 2 years (1712).\n\nIntravenously, SAMe infusions may cause phlebitis (20204). Also, a case of tachycardia has been reported in a patient treated with intravenous SAMe (72988).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, SAMe may cause rash and itching, transient hair loss, sweating, and night sweats (5196, 5199, 5203, 20202, 20230, 73035).\n\nIntravenously, SAMe may cause rash and sweating (20204, 72996, 73038).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nWhen taken orally or given intravenously, SAMe may cause increased salivation, bloating, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache, heartburn, constipation, hunger, thirst, anorexia, blood in the stool, and dry mouth (1712, 5188, 5196, 5200, 5203, 5208, 5221, 5241, 9113, 9981, 12054, 20202, 20218, 73035, 95075, 95076).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, rare adverse effects associated with SAMe include increased urinary frequency (5196).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, SAMe may cause vertigo, headache, insomnia, fatigue, tremors, agitation, dizziness, vivid dreams, and anxiety (5188, 5195, 5196, 5203, 5241, 9981, 12054, 17123, 20203, 20218, 20225, 20230, 20468, 20471, 72942, 73001, 95076).\n\nIntramuscularly, SAMe may cause insomnia , anxiety, hostility, dizziness and drowsiness, and headache, although these events are rare (5188, 20218, 73002).\n\nIntravenously, side effects rarely associated with SAMe include insomnia, anxiety, and psychomotor agitation (20204, 72978, 72988, 73038).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, rare side effects associated with SAMe include blurred vision, and a hot sensation and itchiness of the ear (5195, 5196, 9981, 20225).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, anxiety and tiredness have been reported in patients with depression (5231, 14841). Rare adverse effects associated with SAMe include hypermania (5196). Hypomania has occurred with a combination of intramuscular and oral SAMe (20218). Cases of mania with suicidal ideation have also been reported in otherwise healthy patients (5195, 12231). A crawling sensation on the skin has been reported in a clinical trial (5195). In a case report, a patient with depression self-medicated with oral SAMe and attempted suicide four days later (72965).\n\nWhen used as an injection, rarely SAMe has caused both hypermania and hypomania in people with bipolar disorder or depression (5216, 5231, 17122, 72978). Two suicide attempts occurred in a clinical trial of intramuscular SAMe in patients with major depression (20222).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, congestion has occurred rarely in clinical trials of SAMe (5196, 20225, 72981).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Multiple studies show that oral SAMe can decrease symptoms and improve function in patients with osteoarthritis similarly to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although with a slower onset of action.\nMultiple clinical trials show that taking SAMe orally, 400-1200 mg daily in up to 3 divided doses for up to 84 days, is superior to placebo and comparable to NSAIDs, including the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex), for decreasing symptoms associated with osteoarthritis. SAMe is associated with fewer adverse effects than NSAIDs and is comparable in reducing pain and functional limitation (5188, 5203, 5204, 5205, 5206, 5207, 5208, 5215, 9111, 12054, 20202). Significant symptom relief with SAMe may require up to 30 days of treatment compared to only 15 days with NSAIDs. Some evidence suggests that intravenous loading doses of SAMe 400 mg daily for five days, followed by oral treatment, can speed symptom relief to 14 days (5188).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCholestasis. Clinical research suggests that oral or intravenous SAMe is similarly effective to ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) for treatment of cholestasis.\nTaking SAMe orally, 500 mg twice daily or 1600 mg daily for 2-8 weeks, or intravenously, 800 mg daily or 500 mg twice daily for 14-20 days, seems to be helpful for treating cholestasis associated with acute or chronic liver disease. Several clinical trials have shown that short-term SAMe therapy is superior to placebo in decreasing pruritus, fatigue, alkaline phosphatase levels, and total and conjugated bilirubin in patients with cholestasis (5219, 5239, 5240, 20204, 20229). However, SAMe does not appear to be significantly better than ursodeoxycholic acid (20207, 20208, 20210, 20211).\nless\nDepression. Most short-term clinical studies suggest that SAMe modestly improves symptoms in adults with depression. However, it does not seem to improve the effects of antidepressants when used as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, the benefits of SAMe when used for more than 3 months remain unclear.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research, both conducted in 2024, have yielded conflicting findings regarding the efficacy of SAMe in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). These meta-analyses included studies of oral, intramuscular, and intravenous SAMe given in doses ranging from 45-3200 mg daily for 2-12 weeks. One meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials found that SAMe is no more beneficial than placebo (115768), whereas a separate meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials found, with moderate certainty, that SAMe reduces depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (115769). Both meta-analyses show that SAMe offers no additional benefit when added to the prescription antidepressants imipramine or escitalopram, and that it is similarly beneficial when directly compared to the use of these prescription antidepressants. However, the short duration of the included studies limits the validity of this finding, as prescription antidepressants require 8-12 weeks to demonstrate clinical benefit (115768, 115769). A separate meta-analysis conducted in 2016, which occurred prior to the completion of 5 small clinical trials included in the other meta-analyses, found that SAMe is similarly effective to placebo, imipramine, or escitalopram, but does not add benefit when used as an adjunctive treatment (95075). Overall, the validity of these analyses is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of varying age and disease severity and utilized various routes of administration, doses, formulations, and treatment durations.\n\nA 2022 clinical practice guideline from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends against the use of SAMe for monotherapy while weakly recommending SAMe 1600-3200 mg daily for adjunctive use in MDD, based on mixed evidence (110318).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging. Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this purpose.\nAlcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral or intravenous SAMe is beneficial in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.\nSome preliminary clinical research in patients with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis shows that administering SAMe orally, 400 mg three times daily for 2 years, decreases alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (1712). However, another small clinical study shows that administering SAMe orally at the same dose for 24 weeks does not significantly alter ALT or other measures of liver dysfunction, including international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or total bilirubin levels (20230). SAMe also does not seem to reduce all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver-related complications, transplant rates, or alcohol consumption (1712).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nAntidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Oral SAMe might improve sexual dysfunction in males taking antidepressants.\nIn males taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder who have subjective symptoms of sexual dysfunction, taking SAMe orally, 400 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then 800 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, improves these symptoms when compared with placebo (20470).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear whether oral SAMe is beneficial in patients with ADHD.\nA very small clinical study shows that taking SAMe orally 400 mg three times daily, titrated up to 800 mg three times daily for 4 weeks, might lessen ADHD symptoms in adults when compared with placebo (9981).\nless\nBack pain. Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral SAMe is beneficial in patients with cancer-related fatigue.\nA clinical study in patients with colon cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting shows that SAMe 400 mg twice daily during chemotherapy improves some cancer-related fatigue scores at 3 and 6 months when compared with no supplementation (106932). It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nCirrhosis. It is unclear whether oral or intravenous SAMe is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administering SAMe orally, 600 mg daily or 400 mg three times daily for 1 month, or intravenously, 800 mg once daily or 250-600 mg twice daily for 3-30 days, improves liver function parameters and pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis (20214, 20451, 20460, 20462). However, some conflicting evidence exists. Clinical research in patients with cirrhosis undergoing resection of hepatocellular carcinoma shows that intravenous postoperative administration of SAMe 1000 mg daily for 7 days does not reduce the frequency of postoperative liver insufficiency when compared with control (90111).\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral SAMe for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nFibromyalgia. Limited evidence shows that oral or intramuscular SAMe might modestly improve some symptoms of fibromyalgia.\nClinical research of SAMe has demonstrated modest improvement in some symptoms of fibromyalgia when compared with placebo, or when compared with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy (5211, 5241, 20228). Doses used include 200 mg intramuscularly daily for 21 days, 800 mg orally daily in 2 divided doses for 6 weeks (5241), or 400 mg orally daily in 2 divided doses for 6 weeks, plus 200 mg daily by IM injection (20228).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence for the use of SAMe intravenously for fibromyalgia. Some clinical research shows that SAMe 600 mg intravenously once daily for 10 days does not improve symptoms of fibromyalgia (5221). However, other clinical research shows that 400 mg intravenously once daily for 15 days reduces pain, the number of tender points, and depression scores when compared with baseline (20227).\nless\nGilbert syndrome. It is unclear if oral SAMe is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking SAMe orally, 1200 mg daily, or intravenously, 200-800 mg daily, both for 10 days, improves total and conjugated serum bilirubin levels when compared with placebo or no treatment in patients with Gilbert syndrome (20215, 20461).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral SAMe is beneficial in patients with hepatitis C.\nTaking SAMe 1600 mg daily orally for 2 weeks in between courses of peginterferon and ribavirin seems to improve the early viral response in patients with hepatitis C who previously did not respond to conventional therapy (20466). In other clinical research in patients with a previously poor response to the same conventional therapy, adding SAMe 400 mg three times daily orally and betaine 3 grams twice daily orally increases the percentage of patients with an early viral response from 14% to 59%. However, a sustained viral response was seen in only 10% of patients (20465).\nless\nLead toxicity. Although there has been interest in using oral or intravenous SAMe for lead toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this purpose.\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral SAMe is beneficial for menopausal hot flashes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with frequent menopausal hot flashes shows that taking SAMe (SAM-e Complete, Nature Made Nutritional Products) 400 mg orally once daily for one week, then 400 mg twice daily for another 5 weeks, does not significantly decrease the frequency or severity of hot flashes when compared with an historical placebo control (95076).\nless\nMigraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for migraine, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this purpose.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there is interest in using oral SAMe for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of SAMe for this condition.\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral SAMe is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nA very small clinical study in adults with schizophrenia shows that taking SAMe 400 mg daily orally in divided doses for one week, followed by 800 mg daily in divided doses for 7 weeks, modestly reduces aggressive behavior when compared with placebo (20468).\nless\nSmoking cessation. A small clinical study suggests that oral SAMe does not improve abstinence rates in cigarette smokers.\nPreliminary clinical research in cigarette smokers shows that SAMe (Nature Made, Pharmavite LLC) 400 mg or 800 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve abstinence rates when compared with placebo (20471).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate SAMe for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSAMe is typically taken in doses of 400-1600 mg daily for 2-12 weeks. Daily doses may be given as 1-3 divided doses. Low doses are sometimes titrated up over several weeks. SAMe should be taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before meals or two hours after meals (95075).\nParenteral (Intravenous/Intramuscular):SAMe 200-1200 mg daily as a single dose or divided into 2 daily doses has been given intravenously for 3-30 days. SAMe 200-400 mg once daily has been given intramuscularly for 1-4 weeks.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSAMe is difficult to formulate as a stable oral salt. In fact, the FDA halted trials of an investigational prescription product in 1993 due to concerns about tablet dissolution. Concerns have been raised that some supplements may also have these problems (17122). Currently, several oral salt forms of SAMe are available: sulfate, sulfate-p-toluenesulfonate (also labeled as tosylate), and butanedisulfonate (5231, 5444). There is variability in how these are labeled, such that some products state the quantity of the SAMe salt, and some the quantity of the active moiety (17122). Concerns about the stability of the tosylate formulation have been expressed (5446). The butanedisulfonate salt is stable for 2 years at room temperature (1896, 5444).\n\nSAMe has two isomer forms. The SS isomer is the active form, while the RS isomer is inactive (20471). Specific SAMe tosylate tablets (SAMe Enteric Coated 400 mg, Pharmavite LLC) have been standardized to contain a 65:35 racemic mixture of SS to RS isomers (20471).\n\nOther specific tablets containing SAMe 200 mg (Sayme, Dalim BioTech Co.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, oral SAMe supplements increase blood plasma levels of SAMe, which then return to baseline within 24 hours, with possible gender differences resulting in greater peak levels in females (12231, 20230, 72970, 72985, 72997, 73016). In other human research, after single and multiple oral doses of the SAMe tosylate disulfate salt, peak plasma levels are reached in about 5 hours, and the half-life is about 6 hours (72951). Oral SAMe has low bioavailability. The oral bioavailability of the tosylate salt is 1%, and that of the butanedisulfonate salt is 5%, presumably due to a large first pass effect (1896, 1897). Enteric-coated tablets produce peak plasma concentrations about 3 to 5 hours after ingestion, with a half-life of about 100 minutes (5231, 95075). Following intramuscular injection, SAMe is 80% to 90% bioavailable (73006, 73059).\nDistribution\nSAMe crosses the blood-brain barrier after both oral and intravenous dosing (5217, 5231, 9110, 17122, 72972). SAMe also enters the synovial fluid (72997). SAMe does not appear to bind significantly to plasma proteins (72958).\nMetabolism\nFollowing oral SAMe use for 6 weeks, plasma levels of both SAMe and its metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) increase (72970).\nExcretion\nSAMe is excreted in the urine and feces (5231). Following oral use, urinary excretion accounted for 34% to 40% of the dose (72997). The terminal half-life was 81 minutes following a 100 mg dose and 101 minutes following a 500 mg dose (72997). In patients with liver disease, about 15% of unmetabolized SAMe was excreted in the urine, and about 24% in the feces (72958).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSAMe is a naturally occurring molecule that is distributed throughout most body tissues and fluids (5231). Concentrations are highest in childhood and decrease with age (9114). SAMe plays an essential role in more than 100 biochemical reactions involving enzymatic transmethylation. It contributes to the synthesis, activation and/or metabolism of hormones, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and some drugs (5231, 5232, 9110). SAMe is produced endogenously from homocysteine and 5-methylene tetrahydrofolate (17490). Its synthesis is closely linked to vitamin B12 and folate metabolism (5231). Deficiencies of these vitamins can result in decreased SAMe concentrations in the central nervous system (5231).\nAlzheimer disease effects\nReduced levels of SAMe have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease, and also in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and putamen in postmortem Alzheimer brain studies. It is suggested that this may compromise metabolism and brain function (104812).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nSAMe supplementation may be beneficial in osteoarthritis due to analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. After oral administration of 400 mg daily for seven days, SAMe levels in synovial fluid increase three- to four-fold (9110). SAMe has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in animal models when given both orally and parenterally; but effects on prostaglandins likely do not play a role (72985). Preliminary evidence suggests SAMe might stimulate articular cartilage growth and repair, specifically chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis and proliferation rate 9110,72983). SAMe might also protect against cytokine-induced cell damage by antagonizing the activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on synovial cell proliferation and fibronectin mRNA expression (9110).\nAnti-ulcer effects\nIn gastrointestinal stress ulcer models, there is some evidence that SAMe might have a cytoprotective effect (5213).\nAntidepressant effects\nSAMe may enhance monoamine systems and is involved in the production of monoaminergic neurotransmitters (95075, 95076). It is associated with increased serotonin turnover and elevated dopamine and norepinephrine levels (5196, 5232, 9110, 17490, 95075). Low levels of SAMe have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of severely depressed patients, and these levels can be increased by oral and parenteral administration of SAMe (17122, 72972). Serum levels may also be reduced, although these findings are inconsistent (73004). An increase in SAMe serum levels has been shown to be positively correlated with responses to both SAMe and imipramine therapy as defined by a 50% lower score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (5190).\n\nSAMe supplementation may also work by altering cellular membrane fluidity. Changes in neuronal membrane fluidity might facilitate signal transduction across membranes and increase the efficiency of receptor-effector coupling (5196, 9110, 95075). It may increase the density of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors (95075).\n\nNeuroimaging studies indicate that SAMe affects the brain similarly to conventional antidepressants (9114, 14841). The onset of action for EEG changes is about 1 hour, with a peak effect after 2 weeks of use. EEG changes might be more pronounced in the elderly (14841). Finally, SAMe may increase phosphocreatine levels and decrease beta nucleoside triphosphates, suggesting that SAMe alters cerebral bioenergetics status (72937).\nAntiepileptic effects\nIn a rat model of epilepsy, SAMe 100 mg/kg reduces seizure severity and increases seizure latency (104813).\nCardiovascular effects\nSAMe is metabolized to s-adenosylhomocysteine, which can be metabolized to homocysteine (5232). Homocysteine is remethylated to form methionine, which can then form more SAMe or be converted via trans-sulfuration to the antioxidant glutathione (5232). These reactions require folate, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) (5231). There has been some concern that taking SAMe might increase homocysteine levels. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to cardiovascular and kidney disease (1698). However, in a study lasting 4 weeks, administration of SAMe orally in doses titrated up to 1600 mg daily was not associated with increases in homocysteine levels (12231). In another study, there was no difference in cardiovascular mortality in people with cirrhosis taking SAMe 1200 mg daily for 2 years (1712).\n\nLow levels of SAMe have actually been correlated with coronary artery disease (1714). Administration of SAMe to healthy people has shown a positive effect on 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a key cofactor in homocysteine metabolism. SAMe supplementation has been suggested as a remedy for elevated homocysteine levels (1713). Some research suggests that adequate intracellular SAMe promotes remethylation and trans-sulfuration of homocysteine (9112).\nEndocrine effects\nSAMe has been shown to increase levels of a serotonin metabolite. Serotonin is involved in the thermoregulatory effects of estrogen and subsequent vasomotor function. As such, there is interest in using SAMe in postmenopausal patients to alleviate vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes (95076).\nHepatic effects\nIn liver disease, there appears to be a deficiency of hepatic SAMe. People with acute and chronic liver disease lose the ability to synthesize SAMe from methionine, possibly due to low activity of methionine adenosyl transferase (MAP), the enzyme that converts methionine to SAMe (9115). This can lead to deficiencies in cysteine and choline. It can also lead to depletion of glutathione, which plays a major role in liver detoxification and antioxidant reactions. This depletion may in turn exacerbate liver disease (5198, 5219, 5236, 9116). SAMe supplementation seems to increase the synthesis of glutathione (72980).\n\nIn alcoholic liver disease, SAMe may restore levels of glutathione, decrease inflammation, and increase methylation of DNA (10465). In laboratory research, SAMe has been demonstrated to decrease the negative effects of various agents on bile flow and bile composition (72963), possibly by favoring production of more soluble sulfurated bile salts (72987).\nMyelopathy effects\nIn AIDS-related myelopathy, endogenous SAMe can be depleted. Epidemiological data suggests that people with AIDS have a deficiency of SAMe in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may lead to myelopathy by impairing SAMe dependent myelin and oligodendrocyte repair mechanisms (5217, 5218).\nParkinson effects\nSAMe can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson disease in animal models. This effect may be related to the ability of SAMe to add methyl groups to L-dopa. L-dopa has been shown to deplete the concentration of SAMe, which might explain the depression sometimes seen with Parkinson disease (10466)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of sandy everlasting.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sandy everlasting are the above ground parts, particularly the leaves and dried flowers. Active constituents include flavonoids such as quercitin, kaempferol, naringenin, and isohelichrosin, monoterpenes such as neryl acetate, neryl propionate, and alpha-pinene, hydroxycinnamic acids such as caffeoylquinic acid, acetophenones, gamma-pyrone, sesquiterpene lactones, and phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic and caffeic acids (11, 15335, 96564, 96565, 109660). An essential oil is obtained from the green parts of the plant (96564). The flower typically yields about 0.18% essential oil and the stem yields 0.04% (15338). The oil contains sesquiterpene and monoterpene hydrocarbons including nerol, neryl acetate, neryl propionate, geraniol, linalool, limonene, curcumene, alpha-pinene, selinene, and rosifoliol (96564).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome extracts of sandy everlasting above ground parts have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation (15335). Acetophenones, flavonoids, and phloroglucinols from sandy everlasting have inhibitory effects in several pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism that produce inflammatory mediators. Acetophenones reduce production of leukotriene B4, and inhibit activity of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), cyclooxygenase enzymes, and 5-lipoxygenase. Production of interleukins 1b, 6, and 8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and prostaglandin E2 is also reduced (15336, 96564).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSandy everlasting extracts inhibit the carbohydrate digestive enzymes alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, inhibit maltose digestion, and inhibit SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake in Caco-2 intestinal cells in vitro (96565). In diabetic rats, sandy everlasting decreases blood glucose levels after an oral maltose tolerance test, decreases postprandial glucose levels, and improves hyperinsulinemia (96565).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSandy everlasting flavonoids, terpenes, and other constituents have antimicrobial activity in vitro, primarily against gram-positive organisms, including both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (15337, 96564). Sandy everlasting extracts also restore the activity of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, penicillin, ampicillin, and norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This action is due to inhibition of efflux pumps (96564). Acetophenones, phloroglucinols, terpenoids, and the essential oil of sandy everlasting have antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Penicillium (15338, 96564). The flavonoids and phloroglucinols also have activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nAntioxidant effects\nConstituents of sandy everlasting have antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects, and they inhibit lipid peroxidation (15336, 96564).\nLipid effects\nIn patients with at least 2 traits of metabolic syndrome, taking a hot water extract of the above ground parts of sandy everlasting orally, 1 gram daily for 28 days, reduces body fat content and total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, due to increased fat oxidation (109660). Preliminary research in healthy males shows that a single dose of a hot water extract of the above-ground parts of sandy everlasting increases fat oxidation by about 12% and resting energy expenditure by about 4% when compared with water ingestion alone (109660). Laboratory research in the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 shows that a water extract of sandy everlasting produces a 2-fold up-regulation of the genes for carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 and 2, which increase fatty acid oxidation (109660).\nPhotoprotective effects\nAn extract of sandy everlasting flowers prevents erythema when applied topically before exposure to UVB radiation. This might be due to inhibition of prostaglandin production and histamine release in the skin, as well as increased scavenging of free radicals (96564).\nWound healing effects\nIn animal studies, an ointment or gel containing 0.5% sandy everlasting essential oil applied daily for 14 days decreases wound size and increases granulation rate and tissue healing when compared with the vehicles alone. Also, superoxide anion radical levels are reduced and there is an increase in hydroxyproline content, indicating enhanced collagen synthesis and deposition (109661). The degree of wound contraction after 12 days of treatment was 99%, 81%, and 95%, respectively, for the 0.5% sandy everlasting ointment, the vehicle alone, or silver sulfadiazine ointment 1%. Wounds treated with sandy everlasting had an increase in collagen fiber density and a reduction in generation of reactive oxygen species (109662)."

Sangre de grado leaves contain a more diverse array of alkaloids, including glaucine, isoboldine, magnoflorine, norisoboldine, sinoacutine, taspine, and thaliporphine (73089, 73094). Sangre de grado bark contains the following diterpines: bincatriol, crolechinol, crolechinic acid, hardwickiic acid, and koberins A and B. These diterpenes are present in smaller amounts in the sap. The steroid compound beta-sitosterol has been identified in sangre de grado bark (73094).\n\nCrofelemer (SP-303) is a botanical drug product derived from sangre de grado. It contains a mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers including (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin (94710).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that sangre de grado sap blocks the activation of sensory afferent nerves at the prejunctional and postjunctional levels, leading to relief of pain, burning, and itching caused by neurogenic inflammation (73086, 73094, 73105).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe alkaloid constituent taspine, isolated from sangre de grado, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of pain and inflammation, with anti-inflammatory activity similar to or greater than indomethacin (2795, 73094).\nAntibacterial effects\nVarious extracts and constituents of sangre de grado have demonstrated antibacterial effects in vitro (2798, 73094). The mechanism of sangre de grado's antibacterial effects is unclear.\nAntidiarrheal effects\nClinical research suggests that crofelemer (SP-303), a constituent of sangre de grado, has antidiarrheal effects via an anti-secretory mechanism of action (2784, 73090, 94708). These effects have been demonstrated in animal and in vitro research (2786, 73094, 73103). During episodes of diarrhea, chloride ions are secreted into the intestine. This leads to increased sodium and water excretion in stools. Crofelemer inhibits two chloride ion channels in the intestine. These include cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel and calcium-activated chloride ion channel (CaCC) TMEM16A. Inhibition of these channels limits sodium and water loss during episodes of diarrhea (94707).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that sangre de grado has antineoplastic effects against human cervical (HeLa), oral (KB), leukemia (K562), stomach (AGS), and colon (T84, HT29) cancer cell lines (15101, 73088, 73092, 73094, 73098, 94704). In stomach and colon cancer cells, sangre de grado sap increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation. Sangre de grado's antineoplastic effects may be explained by damage to microtubules and inhibition of cancer cell adherence, both of which have been demonstrated in vitAntiro (73088). Sangre de grado extract induced apoptosis of HeLa cells in vitro and, in animals, slowed tumor growth in a dose-dependent fashion, with tumor growth inhibited by 30%, 45%, and 59% in mice receiving 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg sangre de grado extract, respectively (94704).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that sangre de grado sap has antioxidant effects at high doses but may promote oxidation at lower doses (2799, 73091, 73094, 73096, 73100). The constituents responsible for the antioxidant effects appear to be water soluble, as only an aqueous extract of sangre de grado demonstrated antioxidant effects (2799).\nAntiviral effects\nThe sangre de grado extract crofelemer (SP-303) has demonstrated antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) in clinical, in vitro, and animal research. Crofelemer is thought to interfere with plasma membrane penetration and/or adsorption of HSV. This extract has also shown antiviral activity against influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, in animal and in vitro studies (73094). Another constituent of sangre de grado, taspine, may also exert antiviral activity against HSV, influenza, and parainfluenza (73087).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro research shows that sangre de grado sap has a constrictive effect on vascular and gastric smooth muscles (73101).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that sangre de grado promotes the healing of gastric ulcers. This may be explained by reduced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which has been demonstrated in the gastric epithelium of rats with acetic-acid induced ulcers treated with sangre de grado sap (73085, 73094). It is unclear whether sangre de grado is effective against Helicobacter pylori-induced ulcers. Activity of sangre de grado against H. pylori has been demonstrated in vitro but was lacking in animal models (73097).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro research shows that sangre de grado inhibits classical and alternative complementary pathways and inhibits the proliferation of activated T cells (73093).\nWound-healing effects\nThe wound-healing effects of sangre de grado may be due to a variety of factors. These include the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and protein-binding properties of polyphenol constituents; the antioxidant properties of procyanidin constituents; and the ability of the sap to cover the wound, preventing infection from surface microbes (73094). With respect to specific constituents, the alkaloid taspine and the lignan dimethylcedrusine may play a role in wound healing (2796, 73094, 73106)."

Sarsaparilla contains about 2% saponins, including sarsasapogenin and smilagenin, and other constituents, including quercetin, astilbin, alkaloids, tannins, glycosides, phenols, and phytosterols (beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, pollinastanol) (3, 4, 5, 11, 73124, 73126, 73128, 99992, 103242). Some supplement marketers incorrectly suggest that the sterols from sarsaparilla can be converted into anabolic steroids such as testosterone (11). However, plant sterols cannot be converted to steroid substances in the body (14409). Testosterone has never been detected in any plant, including sarsaparilla (3, 5).\nAnalgesic effects\nTraditionally, sarsaparilla is used for chronic pain and rheumatoid arthritis. Animal research shows that methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of sarsaparilla have analgesic effects, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear (103242).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nTraditionally, sarsaparilla is used for rheumatoid arthritis. Astilbin, a flavanoid isolated from sarsaparilla has been shown to suppress collagen-induced arthritis via selective suppression of lymphocyte functions in mice (73124).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTraditionally, sarsaparilla is used for inflammatory skin conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pain. The anti-inflammatory activity of sarsaparilla is thought to play a role in its possible benefits related to these conditions (4). Animal research shows that methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of sarsaparilla have anti-inflammatory effects, although the precise mechanism of action is unknown (103242). Additional animal research shows that a sarsaparilla extract high in flavonoids has anti-inflammatory effects, possibly by inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway. This research also suggests that sarsaparilla flavonoid extract might convey anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of pro-inflammatory bacteria in the gut (109469).\nAnticancer effects\nTraditionally, sarsaparilla is used for cancer. In vitro, sarsaparilla has shown anticancer effects. Sarsaparilla induced cell growth arrest, as well as apoptosis and autophagy of the cells. Sarsaparilla also seems to inhibit the migration and invasion of some cancer cells, by inhibiting cellular signaling (99992, 99993)."

Less often, cases of duodenal ulcer, dyspepsia, or heartburn have been reported (6772, 73329, 73354). Meteorism (intestinal gas accumulation) has also been reported with saw palmetto, although causality was unclear (60442).\nless\nGenitourinary\nSome clinicians are concerned that saw palmetto might cause erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disturbance, or altered libido because of its potential effects on 5-alpha-reductase. Some preliminary clinical studies have reported sexual dysfunction, particularly ejaculatory dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido, in patients taking saw palmetto (5093, 17202, 17684, 73383, 89441). However, most of these patients were previously diagnosed with prostate disorders, so causality is unclear. Additionally, several clinical studies indicate that the occurrence of impotence in males taking saw palmetto is similar to placebo and tamsulosin (Flomax), and significantly less than finasteride (Proscar) (2732, 6424, 17306, 107481). Rarely, cases of testicular pain, vesical tenesmus, and urinary tract infections have been reported in patients using saw palmetto extract orally (73388).\nless\nHematologic\nSaw palmetto might have antiplatelet effects and potentially increase the risk of bleeding in some patients. There is one report of excessive intraoperative bleeding in a patient who took saw palmetto prior to surgery. Bleeding time normalized when saw palmetto was discontinued (8659). Also, one case of cerebral hemorrhage has been reported, but details are not available to determine causality (6772, 73348). A case of retroperitoneal hematoma after bilateral inguinal hernia repair is reported in a male patient taking saw palmetto. The patient was discharged after a 3-day hospitalization in stable condition (112177).\nless\nHepatic\nA case report describes a patient who developed acute hepatitis and pancreatitis while taking saw palmetto. Symptoms resolved when saw palmetto was discontinued, and reemerged upon re-challenge (14457). Other cases of acute hepatitis and pancreatitis, with elevated alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin have been reported in patients using saw palmetto orally (14457, 73350, 73351).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, saw palmetto may cause fatigue, weakness, muscle pain, and back pain, although these adverse events are rare (6424, 73388, 89441). A case of saw palmetto-related rhabdomyolysis was reported in an 82-year-old male presenting with kidney dysfunction, increased C-reactive protein levels, and elevated serum creatine kinase (73358).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, saw palmetto can cause headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and fatigue (6750, 6752, 6772, 11354, 60442, 73348, 73385, 73388, 89441).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nA case of intraoperative floppy-iris syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in a patient using saw palmetto orally (73340). However, no statistically significant association between saw palmetto and IFIS was found in a case series of 660 patients undergoing cataract surgery (73347).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nRhinitis is one of the more commonly reported adverse effects of saw palmetto (73348). One patient taking saw palmetto extract 160 mg twice daily reported \"breathlessness\" (73388). Two cases of respiratory depression have been reported in patients using saw palmetto extract (Permixon) 320 mg (6772).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Saw palmetto 320 mg daily seems to improve outcomes after TURP surgery in a dose-dependent manner.\nClinical research shows that taking saw palmetto (Permixon, Pierre Fabre Medicament) 320 mg daily for 2 months prior to TURP surgery reduces blood loss, the duration of surgery, the development of intraoperative complications, the duration of catheterization, and the length of hospitalization when compared with placebo (73323, 73353). Although these studies found benefit, a small study using a lower dose of saw palmetto (Prostagood Mono, Abdi Ibrahim) 160 mg orally once daily for 5 weeks prior to TURP did not find any decrease in the risk of perioperative hemorrhage, or the density of prostate tissue (17202).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although individual study results are conflicting, the overall body of evidence suggests that saw palmetto does not offer clinically meaningful improvements in BPH-related symptoms.\nResearch on the use of saw palmetto for improving symptoms of BPH is inconsistent and contradictory. To date, the best available evidence addressing the effectiveness of saw palmetto in patients with BPH comes from two high-quality clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In one of these trials, saw palmetto 160 mg twice daily for one year was ineffective for reducing moderate to severe symptoms of BPH when compared with placebo (14274). In the other trial, taking saw palmetto 320-960 mg daily for 72 weeks did not significantly improve symptoms when compared with placebo (17684). Additionally, meta-analyses of these trials and many of the small trials described below show that taking saw palmetto does not improve BPH-related signs and symptoms or International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) (89441, 102835, 112804).\n\nWhile several small, low-quality clinical trials and observational studies in patients with BPH suggest that saw palmetto provides some improvement in urinary symptoms, nocturia, urinary flow, and/or residual urine volume when compared with placebo or baseline (6750, 6764, 6772, 73315, 73383, 73385, 73387, 89441, 96570, 110541), other studies show that saw palmetto has no clinically meaningful effect on BPH-related signs and symptoms, including prostate volume (5093, 6752, 11314, 73343, 96409). The validity of several of these studies is limited due to the use of per-protocol analyses and/or a lack of placebo control groups. Beyond this, reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear; however, the mixed results may be due to use of different saw palmetto products, varying study methodologies, different patient populations, and varying symptom scoring tools. Additionally, research shows significant variation in the chemical composition of commercially available saw palmetto extracts (17305, 89441).\n\nSeveral clinical trials have compared saw palmetto to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride (Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart). Some small studies suggest that it may be comparable to these medications for relieving BPH symptoms, but with less effect on prostate size or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (6424, 96570). It may also be better tolerated, with a positive effect on sexual dysfunction (6424, 6763, 18215, 89441). Additionally, one observational study in patients with BPH has found that taking saw palmetto 320 mg with tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily for 6 months is associated with similar improvements in IPSS and quality of life scores, but also has a lower risk of reduced libido, when compared with tamsulosin plus dutasteride 5 mg or finasteride 0.5 mg daily (110542).\n\nSome research has also compared saw palmetto to alpha-adrenergic blockers. Alpha-adrenergic blockers appear to have a faster onset of symptom relief (2732, 6750), and saw palmetto might be less effective than the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin (Minipress). Although some studies and a meta-analysis suggest it is similarly effective to tamsulosin (Flomax) after 6-12 months of treatment for improving various symptoms of BPH (6775, 6776, 11243, 89441, 96570, 104804, 107483), another meta-analysis found that alpha-blockers were more effective than saw palmetto for these outcomes (102835). Additionally, tamsulosin appears to be more effective than saw palmetto for reducing prostate volume (104802). However, some research suggests that saw palmetto may be better tolerated than tamsulosin (107483). It is unclear if taking saw palmetto with tamsulosin can improve BPH symptoms. Several low-quality studies and a meta-analysis of two of these studies show no additional benefit over using tamsulosin alone (8901, 89443, 89448, 96410). However, one study suggests that a specific saw palmetto extract (Permixon, Pierre Fabre Medicament) 320 mg daily is associated with a 29% decrease in the IPSS when taken alone, compared with a 37% decrease when taken along with tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily for 6 months. Tamsulosin alone was associated with a 31% decrease (104802).\n\nSaw palmetto has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A meta-analysis of 8 clinical studies in adults with lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH shows that taking saw palmetto in combination with other herbal ingredients does not improve urologic symptoms of BPH when compared with placebo or no intervention (112804). However, small, low-quality studies of various combinations of saw palmetto with other ingredients have demonstrated some benefit for improving symptoms of BPH, and some have shown equivalence to finasteride, tamsulosin, or tadalafil (Cialis). These ingredients include stinging nettle root (PRO 160/120, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) (6763, 17307, 73330, 89441); cernitin, beta-sitosterol, and vitamin E (11241); selenium and lycopene (Profluss, Konpharma) (90354, 97255); pygeum, lycopene, Epilobium parviflorum, and pumpkin seed oil (ProstateEZE Max, Caruso's Natural Health) (92164); and quercetin and beta-sitosterol (Difaprost, Difass International) (96784). Additionally, one study suggests that an enriched form of saw palmetto oil containing 3% beta-sitosterol seems to be more effective than standard saw palmetto oil containing 0.3% beta-sitosterol in reducing IPSS scores (104803).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAndrogenic alopecia. It is unclear if oral or topical saw palmetto is beneficial in patients with androgenic alopecia.\nA small clinical study in males and females with androgenic alopecia shows that taking a specific saw palmetto oil (VISPO, Vidya Herbs) 100 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces hair fall and increases hair density but does not improve hair thickness, anagen-telogen ratio, or most subjective measures of hair growth when compared with placebo (112805). Other clinical research shows that taking saw palmetto extract 320 mg daily for 24 months is less effective for improving hair growth in males with androgenic alopecia when compared with finasteride 1 mg daily (89444).\n\nTopical saw palmetto has also been investigated for treating androgenic alopecia. Some clinical research shows that saw palmetto lotion, applied twice daily for 50 weeks, improves hair density by 27% in individuals with androgenic alopecia. However, a 13% improvement was observed in the placebo group, and no between-group comparisons were made (73435). Another small clinical study in male and females with mild to moderate androgenic alopecia shows that applying 5 mL of a lotion containing saw palmetto oil 20% (VISPO, Vidya Herbs) to the scalp for 30 minutes daily for 16 weeks reduces hair fall and increases hair density but does not improve hair thickness, anagen-telogen ratio, or subjective measures of hair growth when compared with placebo (112805).\n\nSaw palmetto has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small clinical study in males with androgenic alopecia shows that taking a combination of saw palmetto extract 200 mg plus beta-sitosterol 50 mg twice daily for 18-24 months improves subjective scores of hair quantity and quality when compared with placebo (15550). Another small clinical study in males with androgenic alopecia receiving platelet-rich plasma every 3 weeks shows that applying 1 mL of topical saw palmetto, redensyl, and biotin daily for 12 weeks modestly improves subjective hair loss scores and photographic assessment of hair growth when compared with 1 mL of topical Procapil daily (112176). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to saw palmetto, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral saw palmetto for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nChronic bronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral saw palmetto for chronic bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). It is unclear if oral saw palmetto is beneficial in patients with CP/CPPS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that oral saw palmetto 325 mg daily for one year does not significantly improve symptoms of CP/CPPS when compared with finasteride 5 mg once daily (11354). However, a clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe CP/CPPS shows that taking saw palmetto 160 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks improves NIH Chronic Prostatitis Index (NIH-CPSI) score after two weeks of treatment in patients with moderate disease and after 4 weeks of treatment in patients with severe disease when compared with placebo. Independent of severity, 73% of patients taking saw palmetto report a 6-point reduction in NIH-CPSI total score, compared to 33% of patients taking placebo (107482).\n\nSaw palmetto extract has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A preliminary clinical study shows that taking a combination of saw palmetto extract 320 mg, selenium 50 mcg, and lycopene oil extract 5 mg daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms and peak flow in patients with CP/CPPS when compared with baseline. However, these effects were not observed or were less significant in patients treated with saw palmetto alone (60442).\nless\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral saw palmetto for the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nHirsutism. Although there has been interest in using oral and topical saw palmetto for hirsutism, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nNon-neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). It is unclear if oral saw palmetto is beneficial in adults with non-neurogenic LUTS.\nTwo small clinical studies in Japanese adults with non-neurogenic LUTS show that taking saw palmetto fruit extract 320 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve global symptoms of LUTS when compared with placebo. Although each of these studies identified very small differences in certain individual outcomes, such as \"symptom bother\" and \"daytime urinary frequency\", statistical analyses were not controlled for multiple testing and the small differences between groups are unlikely to be clinically relevant (110540, 115753).\nless\nProstate cancer. Small preliminary studies suggest that saw palmetto does not reduce prostate cancer risk or symptoms associated with prostate cancer.\nPopulation research shows that people who take saw palmetto supplements do not have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer (15217). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking saw palmetto 960 mg daily before, during, and after radiation treatment for early prostate cancer does not significantly improve lower urinary tract symptoms when compared with placebo (96412).\nless\nProstatitis. Adding saw palmetto to antibiotic therapy seems to relieve some symptoms of bacterial prostatitis more effectively than antibiotics alone.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with bacterial prostatitis shows that taking saw palmetto extract daily for eight weeks, with prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 15 days, reduces pain and urinary symptoms more than prulifloxacin alone, but the combination does not appear to improve bacterial eradication or sexual dysfunction more than the antibiotic alone (89442). One small clinical study in patients with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis shows that a specific saw palmetto extract (Prostamol Uno, Profluss) 320 mg daily improves symptoms when compared with no treatment (73329).\n\nCombinations of saw palmetto with other supplements have also been used with fluoroquinolone antibiotics, typically resulting in symptom improvement when compared with the antibiotic alone. These supplement combinations include saw palmetto, indole-3-carbinol, and epigallocatexin-3-gallate (Indigal Plus) 2 capsules twice daily for 3 months (73355); saw palmetto 160 mg, stinging nettle 120 mg, curcumin 200 mg, and quercetin 100mg (ProstaMEV plus FlogMEV) for 2 weeks (73346); and saw palmetto 320 mg, Bacillus coagulans 200 mg, and arbutin 100 mg (Lactorepens) daily for 30 days (96411).\nless\nSexual desire. Although there has been interest in using oral saw palmetto for sexual desire, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nSexual dysfunction. Although there has been interest in using oral saw palmetto for sexual dysfunction, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of saw palmetto for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate saw palmetto for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of saw palmetto is the ripe fruit. The lipid fraction contains volatile oils and fatty oils. Many saw palmetto products are standardized based on the fatty acid content (73313). Most saw palmetto extracts used in clinical studies are berry extracts prepared with lipophilic non-polar solvents containing 80% to 90% free fatty acids. However, an analysis of saw palmetto products that are commercially available in Europe shows that the free fatty acid content in these products ranges from about 41% to 81% (17305).\nAdrenergic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that saw palmetto extract has alpha-adrenergic inhibitory properties (5095). However, other evidence suggests that saw palmetto does not act as an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist in vivo (73310).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn men with BPH, a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto berry seems to lower tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta levels, which are markers of inflammation in prostate tissue (11224). Laboratory evidence suggests that saw palmetto inhibits lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase (COX), which are involved in inflammation (6769, 6779, 73328). In addition, evidence from animal research suggests that saw palmetto inhibits mast cell accumulation in the prostate (73396).\n\nIncreased COX-2 expression is also associated with an increased incidence of prostate cancer. Preliminary research indicates that saw palmetto reduces the proliferation of experimental prostate cells, possibly by inhibiting COX-2 expression (8902).\nAntiandrogenic effects\nSaw palmetto has antiandrogenic, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory properties that are purportedly responsible for improving symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Saw palmetto appears to noncompetitively inhibit 5-alpha-reductase types 1 and 2 and to prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in vitro, which might reduce prostate growth (6765, 6769, 6770, 6773, 17308, 70232, 73359, 73369, 73371). However, 5-alpha-reductase levels in prostatic tissue and serum testosterone, DHT, and PSA are not significantly reduced by saw palmetto in vivo (2735, 5093, 6771, 17308, 73364, 73373, 73398, 73399). Saw palmetto does not seem to affect overall prostate size, but shrinks the inner prostatic epithelium (2736, 5093, 73400). Saw palmetto might slow prostate cell proliferation by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor and stimulating apoptosis (6765, 6769, 6770, 11224, 73325, 73359, 73376, 73378, 73390, 73391, 73392, 73399).\n\nInhibition of 5-alpha-reductase and prevention of conversion of testosterone to DHT may contribute to activity of saw palmetto in androgenic alopecia. It is suggested that this condition involves increased sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT, reducing their growth phase and size (15550, 112805). However, topical saw palmetto does not seem to reduce serum DHT despite some evidence of efficacy in treating androgenic alopecia (112805).\nAnticarcinogenic effect\nIn vitro evidence suggests that, in human urological cancer cell lines, saw palmetto extract can inhibit urokinase-type plasminogen activator, an enzyme implicated in tumor cell invasion (73312). Other in vitro evidence suggests that saw palmetto extract induces dose-dependent antiproliferative and/or apoptotic effects on various malignant cell lines, including hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (LNCaP), hormone-insensitive prostate cancer (DU-145), breast cancer (MCF-7), highly metastatic breast cancer (MDA MB231), renal cell carcinoma (Caki-1), urinary bladder cancer (J82), colon cancer (HCT 116), and lung cancer cell lines (A549) (73339).\nDrug metabolism effects\nThere is conflicting evidence about the effects of saw palmetto on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4 (CYP3A4). In vitro evidence suggests that saw palmetto might inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (11026). But when used in healthy volunteers, saw palmetto 320 mg/day does not seem to affect these enzymes (11225, 13712). Saw palmetto also does not seem to affect CYP1A2 or CYP2E1 in healthy volunteers (13712).\nFertility effects\nLaboratory fertility studies indicate that saw palmetto has no effect on oocytes or sperm motility, but it might induce metabolic changes in sperm (4239, 4240).\nHormonal effects\nSome evidence from animal research suggests that saw palmetto fruit extract has estrogenic activity due to its relatively high concentration of beta-sitosterol (73366), However, evidence from human research suggests that saw palmetto extract displays antiestrogenic activity in prostatic tissue of men with BPH (6766).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that saw palmetto extract stimulates the immune system by increasing macrophage phagocytosis up to 2.3-fold and increasing natural killer cell synthesis of interferon-gamma up to 6.3-fold (73341)."

Phenolics and flavonoids include methyl gallate, quercetin, gossypetin, scutellarein glucuronide, eriodictyol, dihydrorobinetin, amaronol B, lanceoletin, and balanitesin. Saponins include anagallisins A-C, anagallosaponin VIII, several araliasaponins, balanitesin, pseudoprotogracillin, and bersimoside (18, 102606, 102607, 110684). Other components include glycosides, kaempferol, rutin, stigmasterol, alkaloids, anagalligenin, carbohydrates, and arvenin-I and II (110683).\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nIn vitro, methanol extracts of scarlet pimpernel aerial and root parts inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes and reduce prostaglandin synthesis (110684).\nAnti-microbial effects\nScarlet pimpernel is traditionally used for infections. In vitro, scarlet pimpernel extract has antifungal and antibacterial effects (102606, 102607). Also, some constituents have bacteriostatic activity (18).

Alkaloids from sceletium also have inhibitory activity against monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and noradrenaline and dopamine transporters in the brain. In a rat model of depression, a specific sceletium extract (Zembrin) 50 mg/kg has similar antidepressant activity to escitalopram 5 mg/kg (106745).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animals, sceletium extracts increase levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and prostaglandin-E2 (17582).

The terminal half-life of gomisin A is approximately 70 minutes (73519).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of schisandra is the fruit. A variety of active constituents including schizandrins, schizandrols, gomisins, schizandrers, schisantherins, wuweizisus, and many others, collectively known as lignans, have been isolated from schisandra (11, 73450, 73506, 73518, 73528). Some schisandra extracts are standardized based on a specific lignan content, such as deoxyschizandrin (15570). Other constituents include citral, stigmasterol, vitamins C and E, and fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acid (15570, 112887).\nAdaptogenic effects\nSchisandra is referred to as an adaptogen; it seems to increase concentration, coordination, and endurance (91391). In animal research, schisandra reduces the increased heart rate during exercise, resulting in decreased fatigue and improved performance (73589) as well as improved endurance (71275). The mechanisms for these effects are not yet known.\nAnti-aging effects\nSchisandra is commonly used to prevent aging. The antiaging effects of schisandra may be related to its antioxidant effects (91391). In an animal aging model, schizandrin B administration protected against oxidative changes related to aging in the mitochondria (73513).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nAnimal research suggests that schisandra may alleviate symptoms and progression of osteoarthritis. A rat model of osteoarthritis shows that treatment with oral schisandra dried fruit extract improves weight bearing capacity (pain behavior) and reduces cartilage degradation and bone erosion. The schisandra treatment also reduces serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), matrix metalloproteinases, and nitric oxide and inhibits phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and NF- kappa B Inhibitor alpha, reflecting decreased inflammation (112888).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSchisandra seems to have anti-inflammatory effects. Cell culture research shows that schisandra lignans inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF), which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties (3767). Animal research shows that schisandra reduces serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases and inhibits phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and NF-kappa B Inhibitor alpha (112888).\nAnticancer effects\nAlthough human evidence is not available, there is some evidence from laboratory research suggesting that schisandra or its constituents may protect against cancer. Mechanisms of action are generally related to inhibition of anti-inflammatory propagation of tumor promotion, induction of apoptosis, protection of nucleic acids, and excretion of the carcinogen (73490, 73493, 73495, 73562, 73564).\nAntiviral effects\nSome evidence suggests that nigranoic acid, which is isolated from the stem of Schisandra sphaerandra, might be useful in HIV therapy. In vitro it exhibits anti-HIV reverse transcriptase and polymerase activity (3768). Lancifodilactone G from Schisandra lancifolia and oxygenated nortriterpenoids from Schisandra micrantha, also have anti-HIV activity (73508, 73509).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nMost human, animal, and in vitro research shows that schisandra inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C19, 2C8, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 (13220, 17414, 23717, 91386, 91388, 96631, 105564, 105566). This activity might be attributed to certain constituents, such as gomisin C (13220, 15570). However, one animal and in vitro study suggests that schisandra and its constituents might also induce CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 by activating the nuclear pregnane X receptor, which can increase CYP enzyme expression (14441). Schisandra and its constituents schizandrin B and gomisin A have been found to inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter (15570, 112974).\n\nSchisandra also inhibits CYP3A5. Observational and clinical research shows that taking schisandra with tacrolimus increases tacrolimus peak levels, prolongs or delays time to peak concentration, increases overall exposure to tacrolimus, and decreases tacrolimus clearance (15570, 17414, 91387, 96631, 105623, 109638, 109639, 109640, 109641, 112889)(112890, 112972, 112973, 112974). Clinical and observational studies show that schisandra increases tacrolimus levels similarly in both expressors and non-expressors of CYP3A5, while other studies suggest it does so to a greater degree in CYP3A5 expressors than non-expressors (105623, 109638, 109639, 109640, 109641, 112889, 112890, 112973, 112974).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSchisandra improves liver function by increasing hepatic glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate, and glutathione-reductase activity. It might also have a hepatoprotective effect by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, increasing liver glycogen production, inducing cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, and promoting hepatocyte growth and liver regeneration (11, 73471, 73486, 73558, 73561, 73572). Heat shock proteins may play a role in the ability of schizandrin B to protect against hepatic apoptosis and cellular damage (73455). Clinical research in heart transplant recipients on triple immunosuppressive therapy with elevated liver enzymes shows that taking schisandra reduces levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin to normal levels in most patients (112972). In some countries, schisandra is used to ameliorate the hepatoxic effects of tacrolimus (112972).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in the therapeutic effects of schisandra for metabolic disorders such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, and hyperlipidemia. Animal research shows that taking ethanolic schisandra seed extract attenuates increases in lipid and glucose levels in mice fed either normal diets or diets high in fat and fructose (105565).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nSchisandra lignans reportedly have anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antifatigue, and tranquilizing effects (11).\nRespiratory effects\nSchisandra lignans reported have antitussive and respiratory stimulant effects (6, 11)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of schizonepeta are the above ground parts. When used to make medicine, the above ground parts of schizonepeta are either sun-dried, or \"carbonized\", which involves stir-frying at a high temperature until the exterior becomes blackish-brown and the interior is dark yellow (12620). Schizonepeta contains volatile oils including menthone, pulegone, and d-limonene, and low levels of methofuran and menthol. It also contains schizonepetin, schizonepetosides A through E, schizonol, schizonodiol, and flavonoids such as diosmetin, hesperetin, and luteolin (12620, 12625, 94787, 94789). The amounts of these constituents vary depending on harvesting time and processing methods (12620, 94788).\nAnti-allergy effects\nIn animal studies, an aqueous extract of schizonepeta produced a dose-dependent reduction in the severity of anaphylactic reactions by reducing plasma histamine levels and the release of histamine from mast cells (12620, 12622). In mice, oral administration of a methanol extract of schizonepeta reduces the itch-scratch response induced by an injection of substance-P (12623).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn a rat pleurisy model, volatile oil extracted from schizonepeta by steam distillation demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity by reducing exudate volume, leukocyte numbers, and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) (94788). In mice, an aqueous extract of schizonepeta produced concentration-dependent inhibition of carrageenan-induced inflammation and reduced TNF-alpha levels (94789). In an animal model of atopic dermatitis, pretreatment with an aqueous extract of schizonepeta inhibited inflammatory changes and reduced hyperplasia of the dermis and epidermis by about 42%. Expression of inflammatory mediators, including NF-kappaB and protein kinases, was reduced, as were levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), TNF-alpha, and IL-6 (103901).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, extracts of schizonepeta have activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12620). Schizonepetin, a monoterpene isolated from schizonepeta, is reported to have antiviral activity in rats (94787).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and animal studies have demonstrated antioxidant effects of aqueous extracts of schizonepeta. These effects include scavenging of free radicals, reduced lipid peroxidation, reduced tissue nitric oxide (NO) levels, and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase (12620, 94789).\nHematologic effects\nIn animals, an extract of the carbonized form of schizonepeta decreased bleeding time by 72.6% and coagulation time by 77.7% when compared to saline (12620). This extract also shortened the prothrombin time (PT) and exerted hemostatic effects by inhibiting fibrinolysis and promoting coagulation (12624).\nHepatic effects\nSchizonepeta contains pulegone which, when metabolized to p-cresol, depletes glutathione and can cause hepatotoxicity (12626)."

Although there is interest in using topical sea buckthorn for dry skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sea buckthorn for this condition.\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral sea buckthorn is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nSome clinical research shows that sea buckthorn berries and extracts can improve the lipid profile in people with hyperlipidemia and/or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a meta-analysis of 11 studies from China and Finland, consuming sea buckthorn berries or extracts for between 12 days and 4 months decreased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 24 mg/dL and triglycerides by about 41 mg/dL and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 10 mg/dL when compared with baseline or a control group (96555). The sea buckthorn doses and formulations used in these studies were not identified. Additionally, a very small clinical study in females aged 50-61 with hypercholesterolemia shows that drinking sea buckhorn juice (ZAMIO, Ltd) 100% 50 mL daily for 8 weeks modestly improves HDL by about 2 mg/dL and LDL by 10 mg/dL, but does not impact total cholesterol or triglycerides when compared to baseline (112171). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.

Topical sea buckthorn oil has also been evaluated, in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in adults with postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy shows that intravaginal application of a specific gel (Meclon Idra Alfasigma, Giellepi) containing sea buckthorn oil, aloe vera, 18-beta-glycyrrhetic acid, hyaluronic acid, and glycogen modestly improves sexual function and reduces vaginal pain, dyspareunia, and symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and burning when compared with a placebo gel. The gel was used daily for 14 days and then twice weekly for 60 days after a 2-week washout (106089).

Sea buckthorn glycosides were found to be eliminated in feces.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sea buckthorn are the flowers, fruit, seeds, and leaves (4504, 9818, 16695). Sea buckthorn fruit contains malic, acetic, quinic, oleic, isolinol, linolenic, stearic, and palmitoleic acids; as well as volatile oil, sitosterol, kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and flavonoids and other phenolics. It also contains carotenoids including beta-carotene, gamma-carotene, and lycopene; amino acids, and vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, and tocopherols (4504, 9898, 16695, 96555). The composition varies based on plant origin, climate, extraction processes used, and storage (16695, 16696, 96555). The fruit provides approximately 400 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams of fruit (16696).\nAnti-aging effects\nSea buckthorn is traditionally used to slow down the aging process and aid in regeneration. In humans, taking a sea buckthorn extract rich in proanthocyanidins mobilizes stem cells involved in regeneration, including certain progenitor, endothelial, and lymphocytoid mesenchymal stem cells (102843).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn laboratory research, casuarinin, a tannin isolated from the leaves of sea buckthorn, inhibited tumor necrosis factor by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation (74067). In healthy subjects and obese patients, sea buckthorn berries and oil have been shown to reduce C-reactive protein concentrations (16692, 35463).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary research in animal models suggests that the fruit juice reduces the incidence and growth of experimentally-induced tumors (468). Antitumor effects might occur due to sea buckthorn's antioxidant properties (468, 74023). In rats fed aminopyrine plus nitrite, sea buckthorn juice increased life span and prevented tumor production by blocking the formation of N-nitroso compounds (468).\nAntihyperglycemic effect\nIn overweight or obese males (BMI 25-35 kg/m2) who experience postprandial hyperglycemia, eating sea buckthorn berries 150 grams before a meal delays the postprandial plasma insulin peak and reduces it by 24% when compared with eating strawberries or no berries. The time to the peak glucose level is also prolonged, although the peak level is not lowered significantly. These effects may be due to an acute improvement in insulin sensitivity following consumption of sea buckthorn berries (96553). It is not known whether sea buckthorn affects glucose control in people with diabetes. However, in laboratory research, sea buckthorn extracts have restored pancreatic beta cells and altered insulin response (102843).\nAntioxidant effects\nVarious laboratory, animal, and human studies have found sea buckthorn to have antioxidant activity. This activity may be the underlying mechanism of sea buckthorn's possible effects on cancer (468, 74023), cardiovascular disease (471, 74058), diabetes (36766), immune function (74047), inflammatory disorders (74026), liver disorders (74078), radiation-induced injury (74065), ocular disorders (17406, 74069), and toxicity of chemotherapy (478).In animal and laboratory research, sea buckthorn, and particularly its flavonoids, have been shown to scavenge free radicals and protect against radiation and oxidative stress (471,74029,74035,74059,74083 ).\nBlood pressure effects\nSea buckthorn has been used to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure (74090). These effects seem to be similar to calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors (74090). In human and animal research, sea buckthorn flavones may reduce blood pressure by various mechanisms, such as reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reducing sympathetic nervous activity, decreasing peripheral resistance, and modulating capillary enzyme activity (74046, 74057, 74084, 74089). In animal and laboratory research, flavones from sea buckthorn were found to inhibit ACE activity and the production of angiotensin II (74046, 74084).\nCardiovascular effects\nFlavonoids from the sea buckthorn fruit are thought to reduce cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol, reducing inflammation, and decreasing platelet aggregation (16693). In healthy volunteers, consuming 28 grams daily of frozen puree of sea buckthorn berries significantly reduces the marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to placebo (16692). However, adding sea buckthorn flavonols to oatmeal porridge does not seem to significantly lower CRP, homocysteine, or levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in humans (16697).\nCoagulation effects\nPreliminary research in animal models and in vitro shows that sea buckthorn berry oil and extracts can inhibit platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion to collagen and fibrinogen, and thrombogenesis (10208, 74016, 96554). These effects are thought to be due to phenolic compounds, including flavones (74016, 96554). Platelet effects seem to occur only at high phenolic concentrations, and ingestion of sea buckthorn juice by healthy human subjects lacks an effect on platelet aggregation (74013, 96554).\nCold stress reduction effects\nPreliminary evidence in humans suggests that sea buckthorn may increase the capacity for cold tolerance, including reduced cardiovascular reactivity (74085, 74093). Studies in animals have shown that sea buckthorn extract may allow for a shift in anaerobic metabolism to aerobic during cold-hypoxia-restraint exposure by affecting several key metabolic enzymes (74037).\nDermatologic effects\nSea buckthorn has been used for various dermatologic conditions. Sea buckthorn was reported to reduce transepidermal water loss and increase skin moisture in patients with atopic dermatitis (74091).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPreliminary research in animal models suggests that a sea buckthorn extract (plant part not specified) and two constituents of the seed oil (beta-sitosterol-beta-D-glucoside and aglycone) might have activity against gastric ulcers (466, 472, 74014, 74033, 74092). Preliminary research indicates that sea buckthorn seed oil might also improve symptoms of reflux esophagitis (479), and improve the symptoms and cure rate of peptic ulcers (480).\nHepatic effects\nIn animal models, the seed oil might protect against carbon tetrachloride, ethyl alcohol and acetaminophen-induced liver damage (469, 470, 16694, 74078).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nVarious animal and laboratory studies have found sea buckthorn to exert immunomodulatory activity (35463,51366,74012,74047,74086 ). According to animal research, sea buckthorn may increase macrophage counts (74086). In hens (a nonmammalian model), sea buckthorn (50mcg/mL) enhanced macrophage membrane function, and at higher dosages (400mcg/mL), it inhibited leukocyte proliferation (51366). In dengue virus type-2 infected blood-derived human macrophages, sea buckthorn leaf extract decreased TNF-alpha and increased IFN-gamma (74048).\nOcular effects\nConsumption of fatty acids has been associated with a decreased incidence of dry eyes. The benefit may be due to the influence of sea buckthorn on tear film osmolarity (17406, 74069).\nRadioprotective effects\nIn animal and laboratory research, sea buckthorn has been shown to protect against radiation-induced damage (74035, 74065, 74087, 74088), possibly through antioxidant activity (74065).\nWound-healing effects\nSome data suggest that sea buckthorn extract (plant part not specified) might protect cells against lipid peroxidation injury (471) and might increase the rate and extent of wound tissue epithelialization and granulation (467). In animal research, sea buckthorn increased wound healing (467, 74056, 74060) and increased blood flow to the wound area (74060)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of sea moss is the entire plant. Sea moss is about 80% water. It provides carbohydrates, as well as small amounts of protein and fat, especially saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. It also provides small amounts of vitamins and minerals. The minerals in the highest amounts include sodium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium (109119, 109120, 109121). It also contains iodine in concentrations ranging from 4-7 mcg per gram (109117). The nutritional values of sea moss can change with storage (109121). Overwintering, which causes stress to sea moss, results in a 10- to 20-fold increase in the dipeptide L-citrullynin-L-arginine, as well as increases in amino acids including citrulline, ornithine, and arginine (109121). Other factors impacting the nutrient profile of sea moss include storage conditions, geographic location, life stage, seawater mineral levels, and local temperature (109119). In addition, bioaccumulation of heavy metals, including arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury, is possible depending on natural levels in the growing environment (109119).\n\nApproximately 50% to 65% of the dry weight of sea moss is comprised of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which is a common food additive. Sea moss is often used as a source of carrageenan (109115, 109118, 109121).\nAntioxidant effects\nSea moss extract has antioxidant effects in vitro (109119).\nPrebiotic effects\nSea moss may have prebiotic effects, resulting in beneficial changes of the gastrointestinal microbiome and altering the lining of the colon. In animal research, sea moss increases Bifidobacterium breve, a beneficial bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium septicum and Streptococcus pneumonia. Also, sea moss increases fecal concentrations of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which are short chain fatty acids (109115)."

There have been some anecdotal and preliminary reports showing subjective improvement in gastrointestinal function, social and behavioral function, and language skills after single infusions of secretin (2917, 6632). However, evidence from clinical studies shows that secretin, as both synthetic human and porcine-derived preparations, is no better than placebo for any outcome measure associated with autism spectrum disorder when given in single or repeated doses (5247, 6136, 7052, 100739, 104257).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDyspepsia.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSecretin is an endogenously occurring gastrointestinal hormone in humans. It stimulates the postprandial secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas (106325). Secretin is in a family of hormones that also includes glucagon, glucose-dependent insulin releasing peptide (GIP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and others. Normal fasting serum levels are 3-15 pg/mL. Secretin is released from S cells in the duodenum and proximal jejunum when duodenal pH falls below 4.5. Serum levels can increase to 30 pg/mL after stimulation (7053, 106325).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn animal research, secretin activity is reduced in pregnant animals fed a high-fat diet, which results in undesirable traits in the offspring, including increased risk of high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction, and reduced conversion of white to brown adipose tissue. In contrast, feeding a whole grain diet to pregnant animals promotes protein expression of secretin in the duodenum and increases secretin levels in the serum and embryo. Giving secretin supplements to pregnant mice with high-fat diet-induced deficiency reduces obesity, improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, increases thermogenic activity and oxygen utilization in adipocytes, reduces adipocyte cell size, and increases browning of adipose tissue in the offspring (112770).\nAppetite effects\nIn human and animal research, intravenous secretin activates brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle glucose uptake, as well as thermogenesis and satiation. In humans, refeeding was delayed by 39 minutes, although caloric intake was not affected (106327). Secretin is released during meals, in response to binding of peptides derived from proopiomelanocortin to neurons in the medio-basal hypothalamus, which activates homeostatic circuits involved in regulation of food intake. Secretin binds to receptors in brown adipose tissue, increasing glucose uptake and activating thermogenesis, which is detected in the hypothalamus, modulating central regulation of food intake (112769).\nCholeretic effects\nIn an animal model of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease, secretin normalized levels of direct bilirubin and liver total bile acid. Furthermore, liver histology was improved. The improvement in cholestasis may be related to the enhanced transport of bile acids and not to the inhibition of bile acid synthesis (106326).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe primary action of secretin is to stimulate release of bicarbonate and water from the pancreas. Intravenous administration of secretin in physiological doses has the same effect. The concurrent presence of cholecystokinin (CCK) potentiates the action of secretin on the pancreas. Administration in pharmacological doses also causes decreased release of meal-stimulated gastrin and decreases gastric acid secretion (7053). Secretin is given intravenously because orally administered secretin is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes (15). Synthetic secretin appears to be as effective as secretin of porcine origin (10226).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is historical interest in the use of secretin for autism spectrum disorder, despite strong clinical evidence indicating a lack of benefit. Secretin began being used for autism based on anecdotal cases showing improvement in symptoms (2917, 6632). Some researchers speculated that certain autistic patients might have abnormally low secretin levels, but this has not been verified. Reliable clinical research shows that secretin does not have a role in treating autism (5247, 6136, 7052)."

Preliminary research in animals shows that securinine may have neuroprotective effects and can improve learning and memory. Securinine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and increases acetylcholine levels. Therapeutic drugs that inhibit acetylcholinesterase are used in therapy for Alzheimer disease and other disease states involving neurological degeneration (93528)."

The meta-analysis shows that taking oral selenium 80-400 mcg daily for up to 12 months lowers thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) but does not affect thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free or total thyroxine (T4), or free or total triiodothyronine (T3) compared with control. However, TSH levels are modestly reduced in a subgroup of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis not taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy (116165).

Selenium seems to help prevent Kashin-Beck disease, but does not improve symptoms in patients with existing disease.\nA meta-analysis of prospective studies conducted in China shows that adding salt enriched with selenium to the diet of healthy children for up to 4 years reduces the odds of developing Kashin-Beck disease by 84% when compared with the use of iodine salt. Additionally, in children with Kashin-Beck disease, adding salt enriched with selenium to the diet might help heal metaphyseal lesions (97945). However, selenium does not seem to improve symptoms in those with existing disease. A clinical trial in children with Kashin-Beck disease shows that selenium supplementation does not improve joint pain or mobility when compared with placebo (55941).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral selenium might reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnant patients.\nA meta-analysis of three low-quality clinical trials in pregnant patients shows that taking selenium 60-100 mcg daily for up to 6 months reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 72% when compared with placebo. Additionally, a meta-analysis of population research has found that the risk of pre-eclampsia is higher in pregnant patients with low selenium levels. Selenium levels were about 6.5 mcg/L lower in those who developed pre-eclampsia compared with those who did not (97946).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAsthma. Oral selenium does not seem to improve asthma symptoms.\nEpidemiological research has found that plasma selenium concentration is not associated with asthma (74422). Also, clinical research in patients with asthma shows that taking selenium 100 mcg daily for 14-24 weeks does not improve symptoms, lung function, use of rescue inhalers, or quality of life when compared with placebo (74490, 74387).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral selenium-enriched yeast does not seem to improve eczema symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with eczema shows that taking selenium-enriched yeast 600 mcg daily for 12 weeks, either alone or in combination with vitamin E 600 IU daily, does not improve symptom severity when compared with placebo (74456).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most research shows that oral selenium does not reduce the risk of CVD.\nMeta-analyses of clinical trials in patients with and without risk factors for CVD show that taking selenium alone or with other supplements for up to 8 years does not reduce the risk of CVD mortality or fatal and non-fatal CVD events (90360, 97078). When reported, patients in these studies all had adequate plasma selenium levels at baseline (90360).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral selenium does not seem to prevent cancer of the colon and rectum.\nEpidemiological research has found no association between serum concentrations of selenium and the risk of developing colorectal cancer (74321, 97085). Also, meta-analyses of clinical research, as well as individual clinical trials, show that taking selenium 100-200 mcg daily, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, does not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer when compared with control (16707, 34676, 90361, 97092).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Most research shows that oral selenium supplementation does not improve cholesterol levels.\nA meta-analysis of 11 clinical studies in adults with dyslipidemia shows that taking selenium 50-300 mcg daily for 8-24 weeks does not increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels or decrease total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with placebo. Taking selenium might modestly improve triglyceride levels, but this improvement is unlikely to be considered clinically significant (99662). Another meta-analysis of 21 mostly small, low-quality clinical studies, some of which were included in the prior meta-analysis, shows that taking various forms of selenium may modestly decrease total cholesterol levels, but does not improve triglycerides, LDL, or HDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (110595). However, the validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which assessed various selenium dosing regimens and enrolled healthy patients or those with various cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions.\nless\nLow birth weight. Oral or intravenous selenium supplementation does not improve outcomes in low birth weight infants.\nLow selenium levels have been documented in low birth weight infants. However, selenium supplementation, orally or intravenously, does not appear to improve most outcomes in low birth weight infants. Clinical research shows that administering selenium, either as 7-10 mcg/kg daily parenterally or 5 mcg/kg daily orally, does not improve oxygen dependency or reduce the risk of death in low birth weight infants when compared with placebo. However, supplementation decreases the incidence of sepsis by up to 33% (74288, 97083).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral selenium does not reduce lung cancer risk in most patients.\nWhile a large cohort study suggests that increased dietary intake of selenium is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer, supplemental selenium does not appear to have the same effect. Additionally, a meta-analysis of three large clinical trials of over 20,000 patients, including patients with resected stage I non-small-cell lung cancer, shows that taking selenium 200-400 mcg daily for up to 5 years does not reduce the risk of lung cancer when compared with control (92912, 97092). A secondary analysis of one of these studies found that selenium supplementation might reduce lung cancer risk in people with selenium levels below 105 ng/mL (9798). Also, a large study in healthy Chinese patients shows no benefit of using selenium in combination with other nutrients for over 5 years when compared with control (34539).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. Oral selenium does not reduce the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and has been linked to increased risk in some patients.\nEpidemiological research has found that higher selenium intake is not associated with a reduced risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (97085). Furthermore, clinical research shows that taking selenium orally 200 mcg daily does not reduce the risk of basal cell carcinoma when compared with control (2664, 10687). In addition, some evidence shows that daily selenium supplementation might increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma and total non-melanoma skin cancer (10687).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Intravenous sodium selenite does not seem to reduce morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patients.\nA very large clinical study in adults undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or cardioplegic arrest shows that administering intravenous high-dose sodium selenite 2000 mcg/L perioperatively and postoperatively, followed by 1000 mcg/L daily in ICU for up to 10 days, does not improve the number days alive, days without organ dysfunction, mortality rates at 30 days or 6 months, ICU or hospital length of stay, or readmission rates compared with placebo (113651). Additionally, there is no improvement in functional recovery measures, including 6-minute walk distance at hospital discharge or 3 months, with the same dosing regimen (116167). A small post-hoc analysis of this study focusing on patients requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support for cardiogenic shock reveals no improvement in survival rates or duration of mechanical circulatory support with the same selenium protocol (116166).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral selenium does not seem to reduce prostate cancer risk.\nPopulation studies have found that higher serum or toenail selenium levels are associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (8734, 8735, 8736, 92911, 10263). However, clinical research does not support this finding. A meta-analysis of 5 large clinical trials of over 20,000 patients shows that selenium 200-400 mcg daily for up to 5 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared with control (97092). A 7-14 year follow-up study of one of these trials shows there was still no reduction of prostate cancer risk (17688). Selenium has also shown no benefit when used in combination with other supplements. In a large-scale clinical study (SU.VI.MAX), taking selenium 100 mcg in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc did not reduce prostate cancer risk (14135).\n\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding selenium and prostate cancer risk, stating that it is highly unlikely that selenium supplements reduce the risk of prostate cancer (102373).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral selenium does not seem to reduce psoriasis severity.\nClinical research shows that taking selenium-enriched yeast 600 mcg daily for 12 weeks, either alone or in combination with vitamin E 600 IU daily, does not reduce the severity of psoriasis when compared with placebo (74460).\nless\nSepsis. Intravenous selenium does not appear to improve outcomes in septic adults.\nEarlier meta-analyses of clinical trials in septic adults showed that parenteral administration of selenium, along with routine nutritional interventions, reduces the risk of mortality by 11% to 27% when compared with placebo (90347, 92907, 92910). However, a more recent meta-analysis, which includes a large, multi-center study of over 1000 cases, shows that parenteral selenium does not reduce mortality in septic adults at 28, 90, or 180 days when compared with placebo (99658).\n\nEnteral selenium with other nutrients has been studied for sepsis in children. Clinical research in children shows that taking enteral selenium 40-400 mcg daily with zinc, glutamine, and IV metoclopramide is no more effective than whey protein for reducing time to first episode of nosocomial infection or sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the selenium combination treatment might reduce the risk for sepsis in immunocompromised pediatric patients (86095).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nBladder cancer. Despite promising initial research, oral selenium does not seem to prevent the development, recurrence, or progression of bladder cancer.\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding selenium and bladder cancer risk based on two small studies. However, the FDA determined that it is highly uncertain that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer (102373).\n\nSince then, most available research has not confirmed an association between selenium and bladder cancer risk. Epidemiological and clinical research suggests that selenium supplementation is not associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer and does not prevent recurrence, slow progression, or improve overall survival in patients with bladder cancer (97085). One moderate-sized clinical study shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily with or without vitamin E 200-400 IU daily for 7 years does not prevent bladder cancer in older males (90352). Another small clinical study shows that taking selenium yeast 200 mcg daily for 3 years does not prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer when compared with placebo in patients that had undergone a transurethral resection for non-invasive bladder cancer (97087). These findings are supported by another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with non-invasive bladder cancer which shows that taking selenium 200 mcg with or without vitamin E 200 IU daily for a median of 1.5 years does not prevent recurrence, slow bladder cancer progression, or improve overall survival when compared with placebo over a median follow-up period of 5.5 years (114116).\nless\nDiabetes. Increased intake of selenium, either in the diet or as a supplement, is associated with an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nObservational research suggests that high serum selenium levels, high dietary selenium intake, and selenium supplementation are each linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes (97091, 99661). Consuming more than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of selenium daily is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes when compared with consuming less than the RDA (99661).\n\nHowever, the effect of short-term selenium supplementation in patients with diabetes is unclear. Two meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with various health conditions show that taking supplemental selenium as selenium yeast, sodium selenite, or selenomethionine in doses of 100-960 mcg daily for 4 to 96 weeks reduces serum and fasting insulin levels and increases measures of insulin sensitivity but does not lower fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. Additionally, selenium supplementation does not reduce total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglycerides but may improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (110593). However, the validity of the findings from the meta-analyses is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled healthy adults and patients with diabetes, gestational diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), cancer, and Alzheimer disease.\n\nSelenium has also been evaluated in adults with gestational diabetes. A large single-center clinical study conducted in Turkey shows that taking oral selenium 200 micrograms daily for 4 weeks with dietary intervention slightly lowers fasting, 1-hour, and 2-hour blood glucose levels compared with dietary intervention alone (116170).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces the risk of cognitive decline in older adults.\nA cross-sectional study in elderly Americans has found that lower blood levels of selenium are associated with a greater risk of poor cognitive scores when compared with higher levels (104426).\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. Although there is interest in using oral selenium for alcohol-related liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of selenium for this condition.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there is interest in using oral selenium for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of selenium for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with Alzheimer disease shows that taking selenium 200 mcg with a probiotic daily for 12 weeks improves cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) when compared with placebo. However, when selenium 200 mcg was taken alone, no improvement in cognitive function over placebo was found, so it is unclear whether the improvements in cognitive function are due to the probiotics or the combination of ingredients (113659).\n\nAnother very small clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking supranutritional selenium 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not change cognitive measures, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, or neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer disease progression when compared with placebo or nutritional selenium doses. However, the control group showed worsened diffusivity imaging markers indicative of deterioration of axonal structure integrity, while no such decline was noted in supranutritional selenium neuroimaging (113660).\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking a combination product containing selenium, hydrolyzed collagen, taurine, cysteine, methionine, and iron (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs) daily for 12 weeks daily along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone (111636). It is unclear if this effect is due to selenium, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nArsenic poisoning. It is unclear if oral selenized yeast is beneficial for patients that were exposed to high levels of arsenic in the environment.\nA small clinical study in Chinese people environmentally exposed to high concentrations of arsenic shows that taking selenized yeast providing 100-200 mcg of selenium daily for 14 months decreases the concentration of arsenic and symptoms of toxicity when compared with placebo (7831).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in men with BPH shows that taking selenium 240 mcg plus silymarin 570 mg daily for 6 months reduces lower urinary tract symptoms when compared with placebo (88155). Another clinical study in men with BPH shows that taking tamsulosin 0.4 mg plus a specific product containing selenium, saw palmetto, and lycopene (Profluss, Ayanda AS) daily for one year improves lower urinary tract symptoms and urodynamic parameters when compared with tamsulosin-alone (90354). It is unclear if these effects are due to selenium, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nBurns. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with burns on 46% of their body surface suggest that taking a combination of copper 2.5-3.1 mg, selenium 315-380 mcg, and zinc 26.2-31.4 mg daily reduces the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia, but does not seem to improve wound healing, hospital stay, or mortality, when compared with placebo (6520, 74382). Another very small clinical study in burn patients suggests that taking copper 4.5 mg, selenium 190 mcg, and zinc 40 mg daily reduces the duration of hospitalization, but does not have an effect on recovery and wound treatment requirements, when compared with standard dietary doses of these nutrients (74485).\nless\nCancer. Selenium does not seem to reduce the risk of cancer in most people, but it might be beneficial in those with low selenium levels and in men.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research and several clinical studies show that selenium supplementation does not reduce the incidence of cancer or cancer-related mortality when compared with control (14109, 34538, 74414, 97078, 97092). In clinical studies, selenium 100-400 mcg taken daily for 2-7.5 years with or without additional antioxidants did not reduce overall cancer risk (14109, 34538, 74414). However, most evidence did not assess baseline selenium levels.\n\nOther evidence suggests that selenium may have a benefit in men and in people with lower selenium levels. Epidemiological research has found that selenium intake at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 55 mcg or higher is associated with decreased cancer incidence and cancer mortality, especially in men (97085, 103164). However, this research suggests that cancer risk was also influenced by age, body mass index, and smoking status (103164). Some clinical research also suggests that taking selenium might decrease the risk of cancer, when only men are considered (14109). An older meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that selenium was particularly beneficial in patients with lower baseline levels of selenium and in patients at high risk for cancer (90350). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that consumption of selenium may produce anticarcinogenic effects and reduce the risk for certain forms of cancer. However, the FDA has determined that the evidence is limited and inconclusive (102374).\nless\nCataracts. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn ancillary clinical study shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily with or without vitamin E 400 IU daily for around 5.6 years does not reduce the risk of age-related cataracts in men when compared with placebo (92902).\nless\nCervical dysplasia. It is unclear if oral selenized yeast is beneficial for patients with cervical dysplasia of mild severity.\nA small clinical study in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) shows that taking yeast containing selenium 200 mcg daily for 6 months resulted in regression of CIN1 in 88% of participants, compared with regression in only 55% of participants taking placebo (97944).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in cancer patients shows that drinking a beverage containing vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium does not prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity when compared with a placebo beverage (74340). However, poor compliance to treatment may limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral selenium for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of selenium for this condition.\nCirrhosis. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis shows that taking a combination of selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, methionine, and coenzyme Q10 for 12 weeks does not improve fatigue or any other disease-related symptoms when compared with placebo (34494).\nless\nCisplatin-associated ototoxicity. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in cancer patients shows that drinking a beverage containing vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium does not prevent cisplatin-associated hearing loss when compared with placebo beverage (74340). However, poor compliance to treatment may limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nColorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral selenium prevents recurrence of adenomas in the colon and rectum.\nA large clinical study in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas shows that taking a specific selenium supplement (SelenoExcell High Selenium Yeast, Cypress Systems) 200 mcg daily for about 33 months does not reduce adenoma recurrence when compared with placebo. However, in a sub-group of patients with advanced adenomas at baseline, selenium seems to reduce risk of recurrence by 18% when compared with placebo (97091). Some research also shows that taking selenium in combination with zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E reduces adenoma recurrence when compared with placebo (92903). It is not clear any benefit is due to selenium, other nutrients, or the combination.\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in elderly patients with heart failure living in Sweden shows that taking a specific selenium supplement (SelenoPrecise, Pharma Nord) 200 mcg plus a specific coenzyme Q10 supplement (Bio-Quinon, Pharma Nord) 200 mg daily for about 4 years reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality by about 55% when compared with placebo (92904). The risk reduction seems to be most pronounced in patients with lower selenium levels (97906). Furthermore, at 10- and 12-year follow-ups, cardiovascular mortality in the treatment group continued to be 49% and 41% lower, respectively, when compared with placebo (96546, 97466). It is unclear if the benefit can be attributed to selenium, coenzyme Q10, or the combination.\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral selenized yeast is beneficial for patients undergoing CABG surgery.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing CABG surgery shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily as selenium yeast for 4 weeks improves glycemic control, lipid levels, and markers of inflammation when compared with placebo (103163). It is not known whether this influences the outcome or complications of CABG surgery.\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Evidence on the use of intravenous selenium in critically ill patients is conflicting.\nThe most recent meta-analysis of 24 clinical trials in critically ill patients shows that intravenous selenium does not improve survival over 6 months, shorten hospital stay, or reduce intensive care unit (ICU) stay, infectious complications, development of acute kidney failure, or duration of mechanical ventilation when compared with control. Also, length of ICU stay was increased by about 4.5-fold in patients receiving selenium in doses of more than 1000 mcg daily (109086). These findings are similar to those of a meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials in critically ill patients from 2016 which shows that intravenous selenium given alone or with other nutrients does not improve mortality, duration of hospital stay, or kidney function when compared with control (97090). However, another recent meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials in critically ill patients shows that intravenous selenium reduces total mortality by 14% and shortens hospital stay by about 2 days when compared with control, without affecting ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or mortality over 28 days (101345).\n\nThe reasons for these discrepancies are not clear and do not seem to be completely explained by differences in doses or durations of selenium (109086). Some reasons for the discrepancies might include differing analytic methods used in meta-analyses, as well as variations in forms of selenium, concomitant treatments, and specific patient populations. One sub-analysis shows that, when limited to randomized controlled trials examining the effect of selenium supplementation in patients sustaining traumatic injury, the odds of mortality was reduced by about 26% and duration of ICU and hospital stay were modestly reduced. There was no effect on infectious complications (109090).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral selenium prevents dementia or reduces symptoms.\nObservational research has found that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 4 years does not decrease the incidence of dementia in men 60 years or older (93570). However, the follow-up period may not have been long enough to reliably detect the effect of selenium on the development of dementia. Also, the screening method used to detect new cases of dementia may have failed to identify individuals presenting with only the initial symptomatic stages of the disease (93570, 93571).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for the treatment of prevention of depression.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found no difference in serum levels of selenium between patients with or without depression. In addition, serum levels of selenium do not correlate with depression scores (109091). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that selenium supplementation, usually 100-200 mcg daily, modestly reduces symptoms of depression; however, at least one of the three studies included in this meta-analysis investigated the effects of selenium in patients with postpartum depression, specifically (109091). These meta-analyses are limited by the quality of included research and the small number of available studies.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral selenium alleviates diabetic nephropathy symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking selenium (Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 12 weeks does not improve kidney markers such as blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine when compared with placebo (97084).\nless\nDilated cardiomyopathy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of selenium in patients with Keshan disease and peripartum cardiomyopathy.\nObservational research in patients with a specific type of dilated cardiomyopathy called Keshan disease and congestive heart failure has found that selenium supplementation is associated with a 61% decreased risk of cardiac death when compared with no supplementation (101346). A small clinical study in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and selenium deficiency shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 3 months does not seem to improve heart failure symptoms or left ventricle systolic function, or prevent death, when compared with no treatment (104420).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. Limited research suggests that oral selenium does not reduce esophageal cancer risk.\nLow quality clinical research suggests that taking selenium supplements alone or with other vitamins does not decrease the risk of esophageal cancer when compared with control (4679, 12185).\nless\nGastric cancer. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients and in a specific patient population; its effect when used alone and in other populations is unclear.\nPopulation research in Chinese patients has found that high levels of selenium are associated with lower risk of gastric cancer and cancer mortality (97948). However, clinical research does not agree. A large clinical study in patients residing in China shows that taking selenium 37.5 mcg in combination with vitamin C 250 mg and vitamin E 100 IU twice daily for about 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer or precancerous gastric lesions when compared with placebo. This combination treatment was not associated with reduced gastric cancer incidence or mortality at the 14-year follow-up of this study (14447, 51470). Another clinical study in healthy Chinese adults also shows that taking a combination of selenium 50 mcg, vitamin E 30 mg, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily for 5.2 years does not reduce the risk of gastric cancer when compared with control (4679). It is unclear if these findings are generalizable to populations in geographic locations other than China.\nless\nGraves' ophthalmopathy. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for Graves' ophthalmopathy.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy shows that taking oral selenium 100-200 micrograms twice daily for 6 months reduces disease activity, based on factors including pain, swelling, and redness, and improves eyelid opening, but not eye protrusion, when compared with placebo (116169).\nless\nHepatitis C. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with hepatitis C shows that taking a combination of selenium 200 mcg, vitamin C 500 mcg, and vitamin E 945 IU daily for 6 months does not have an effect on levels of alanine aminotransferase or viral load when compared with placebo (74377).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral selenium improves outcomes in patients with HIV.\nClinical trials in HIV-positive men and women, most receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART), shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for up to 2 years can reduce HIV-1 viral load, increase CD4 cell counts, and lower the risk of hospitalizations when compared with placebo (15266, 74314). However, not all research agrees. Two small clinical trials in HIV-positive patients taking ART shows that taking selenium 100-200 mcg daily for 6-12 months does not reduce the risk for opportunistic infections and does not increase CD4 counts when compared with control (7830, 104417). Furthermore, selenium does not seem to benefit patients that are not receiving conventional ART. A large clinical study in HIV-infected pregnant patients in Tanzania with poor access to ART shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily with prenatal vitamins until 6 months after delivery, does not improve progression of HIV nor pregnancy outcomes when compared with no selenium supplementation (74419). Another large clinical study in HIV-infected and ART-naïve patients in Botswana shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 24 months does not slow HIV progression when compared with placebo (92905).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral selenium improves blood pressure. Some evidence suggests selenium supplementation may slightly increase systolic blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in adults with various health conditions shows that taking selenium or selenium yeast 100-200 mcg/day for 6-12 weeks may increase systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg but does not impact diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (110595). However, the validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, obesity, or heart failure. Additionally, all studies were conducted in Iran; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to populations in other geographic locations.\nless\nHyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral selenium alleviates symptoms in patients with Graves' disease.\nA small clinical study in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism shows that taking sodium selenite 300 mcg daily in addition to treatment with methimazole for 24 weeks does not affect symptoms or recurrence rates when compared with placebo plus methimazole (97089).\n\nOral selenium has also been studied in combination with other supplements. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease and low levels of selenium and vitamin D shows that taking selenium 100 mcg daily for 180 days along with vitamin D as cholecalciferol 7000 IU weekly for 270 days, in addition to methimazole, modestly reduces levels of serum free thyroxine and improves quality of life when compared with methimazole alone. However, taking selenium and vitamin D did not affect levels of free triiodothyronine or positive thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody (109049).\nless\nHypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral selenium improves thyroid hormone balance in elderly individuals, pregnant patients, or patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. In patients with iodine deficiency, selenium supplementation may be harmful.\nLow selenium levels or selenium deficiency seems to reduce conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). However, clinical research in healthy elderly patients is conflicting. Although one study shows that taking selenium 100 mcg daily for 3 months increases conversion of T4 to T3 when compared with placebo (17508), a larger study shows that taking selenium 100-300 mcg daily for 6 months does not impact conversion of T4 to T3 when compared with placebo (17509). Additionally, taking selenium can worsen hypothyroidism in people with iodine deficiency. People who are iodine- and selenium-deficient should not receive selenium supplements without concomitant iodine. In these individuals, selenium increases conversion of T4 to T3, but the thyroid gland lacks iodine to synthesize more T4 (1664, 14563, 14564, 14565, 17508). Selenium does not have a significant effect on thyroid function when iodine intake is adequate (1664, 4844).\n\nIn pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, clinical research shows that taking selenium does not reduce complications such as pre-eclampsia or preterm birth. However, selenium might improve postpartum thyroid function and decrease the risk of postpartum thyroiditis (17507). Also, taking selenium 200 mcg daily during pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of developing postpartum thyroid dysfunction and permanent hypothyroidism by 41% and 42%, respectively, when compared with placebo in euthyroid pregnant patients who are positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies (74391).\n\nSelenium supplementation has also been evaluated for hypothyroidism in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical and observational research in adults with hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and other thyroid disorders shows that taking a combination of selenium 83-166 mg and inositol 600-1200 mg orally daily for 6-12 months modestly improves thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels when compared with control (110591, 114562). It is unclear if these effects are due to selenium, inositol, or the combination.\nless\nInfluenza. Although there is interest in using oral selenium for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of selenium for this condition.\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for improving lipid parameters in patients on hemodialysis.\nSelenium levels may be low in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, and supplementation might be needed (1805, 11053). However, clinical research in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking selenium daily for 3 months does not improve the lipid profile when compared with taking placebo (109095).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if topical or oral selenium alleviates oral lichen planus symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus shows that applying a selenium hydrogel (selenomethionine 14 mcg/gram) twice daily for 6 weeks seems to significantly reduce pain at a 12 week follow-up, but not immediately after use, when compared with applying topical corticosteroids and antifungal agents 2-4 times daily. Taking oral selenium 200 mcg twice daily for 6 weeks seems to be no different than the topical corticosteroids and antifungal treatment at both time points (104422).\nless\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces liver cancer risk.\nPreliminary clinical research in China suggest that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 2-5 years can reduce the incidence of liver cancer when compared with control (74389). The benefit of selenium on prevention of liver cancer in Western countries is unknown.\nless\nLymphedema. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces lymphedema complications.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with secondary lymphedema after breast cancer surgery shows that taking a sodium selenite solution 1000 mcg daily for 1 week followed by 300 mcg daily for 2 weeks and then 200 mcg daily for a total of 15 weeks might reduce recurrence of erysipelas, a type of bacterial skin infection, when compared with placebo (15334).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral selenium, used alone or in combination with other antioxidants, improves pregnancy or live birth rates for couples with idiopathic male infertility.\nMeta-analyses of 2-3 clinical trials in males with infertility show that taking selenium, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, for 12-26 weeks modestly improves sperm count and motility, but does not improve sperm morphology, when compared with placebo. Pregnancy rates and live birth rates were only studied in one clinical trial each, with no statistical evidence of benefit (109094, 111459). However, the included studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Studies included in the analysis used selenium 26-200 mcg daily for 3-26 weeks, either alone or in combination with vitamin A 1 mg, vitamin C 10 mg, and vitamin E 15 mg; vitamin E 400 IU and folic acid 5 mg; lycopene 6 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, vitamin C 100 mg, zinc 25 mg, folate 0.5 mg, and garlic 1000 mg; or N-acetyl-cysteine 600 mg (74526, 74493, 102968, 109094, 111459).\n\nSelenium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A retrospective study in adult males with idiopathic and varicocele-related infertility suggests that taking a combination product containing selenium 50 mcg, vitamin B12, L-carnitine, acetyl L-carnitine, citric acid, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, zinc, and folic acid (Proxeed Plus, AltaSigma) twice daily for 6 months is associated with improvements in ejaculate volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility when compared to baseline. However, improvements in sperm morphology were lacking. Furthermore, patients with more severe varicocele seem to benefit most (111296). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of comparator group. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to selenium, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMercury toxicity. It is unclear if oral selenium improves clearance of mercury and reduces symptoms of toxicity.\nA small clinical trial in Chinese adults environmentally exposed to high concentrations of mercury shows that taking selenium-enriched yeast, containing selenium 100 mcg, daily for 3 months increases urinary excretion of mercury when compared with control (90351).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of selenium in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that supplementation with sodium selenite 1 mg daily for 6 months does not improve disease activity in patients with muscular dystrophy (74455).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for weight reduction.\nA small clinical study in adults with obesity shows that taking selenium 240 mcg daily and following a low-calorie diet for 3 months does not reduce body weight when compared with following a low-calorie diet alone (104416). Additionally, a very small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking L-selenomethionine 200 mcg and zinc gluconate 25 mg once daily for 8 weeks does not improve body mass index (BMI), total body fat, or fat free mass when compared with placebo (111448).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for reducing oral mucositis in patients undergoing radiotherapy.\nA small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancers shows that taking selenium 200 mcg twice daily for the duration of radiation therapy does not seem to reduce the incidence or severity of oral mucositis when compared with placebo (104421). It is unclear if other doses or routes of administration might be beneficial.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific selenium-containing combination supplement (Selenium-ACE) does not improve most clinical symptoms when compared with placebo (74449).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces ovarian cancer risk.\nEpidemiological research has found that there is no association between dietary selenium intake and the risk of developing ovarian cancer (74342).\nless\nOverall mortality. Although oral selenium does not seem to reduce overall mortality risk in most patients, it might have benefit in patients with low nutrient intake.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that selenium supplementation, alone or in combination with other micronutrients, does not reduce all-cause mortality when compared with placebo (15305, 90360, 97078). Selenium might also not be beneficial when used in combination with non-nutrient supplements. An additional large clinical study in elderly patients in Sweden shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily plus coenzyme Q10 100 mg twice daily for around 5 years does not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality when compared with placebo. The baseline selenium status of these patients is unclear (92904).\n\nDespite these results, some evidence suggests that selenium used with other nutrients might have benefit in patients with low nutrient intake. In a large clinical study, selenium in combination with zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene lowered all-cause mortality risk in men, but not women, when compared with control (14109). Researchers speculate that this result occurred because men have a lower intake of dietary antioxidants than women. Another large clinical study in Chinese patients with chronically low nutrient intake shows that taking selenium with beta-carotene and vitamin E decreases stroke mortality, cancer mortality, and total mortality when compared with control (2673).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces pancreatic cancer risk.\nSome epidemiological research has found that increased selenium intake is associated with a 34% lower risk of pancreatic cancer (97093). However, other observational research has found no association (101342).\nless\nPancreatitis. Although there is interest in using oral selenium for pancreatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of selenium for this condition.\nPeriodontitis. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing selenium 30 mcg, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal measures such as bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation when compared with placebo (111708).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for PCOS.\nMost available research addressing the effects of selenium on the hormonal, metabolic, and reproductive symptoms associated with PCOS is conflicting. Meta-analyses of small clinical studies and a small clinical study in adults with PCOS show that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 8-12 weeks might reduce total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels but does not seem to improve other hormone levels when compared with placebo (109096, 113653, 113654, 113657). Additionally, a small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking selenium yeast or selenium (Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity of alopecia, acne, and hirsutism when compared with placebo (109096). Research is conflicting whether selenium improves lipid profiles, glycemic indices, insulin metabolism, or anthropometric measures (109096, 110596, 113642, 113654, 113657).\n\nThe effect of selenium on pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS who are undergoing or candidates for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking selenium (Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks results in a significantly higher pregnancy rate of 19%, compared with 3% in those taking placebo (109096). However, another very small clinical study of the same population and dosing regimen shows that selenium does not improve IVF outcomes including pregnancy rate, endometrial thickness, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, or number of embryos when compared with placebo (113640).\n\nSelenium has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adults with PCOS shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 12 weeks, along with a combination probiotic product, modestly improves subjective scores of depression, anxiety, and stress when compared with placebo. Taking this combination also modestly reduces total testosterone levels and subjective ratings of hirsutism when compared with placebo (99659). It is unclear if these effects are due to selenium, the probiotic, or the combination.\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for postpartum depression.\nA meta-analysis of two observational studies has found that a high selenium intake is associated with a modestly reduced risk of postpartum depression. The effect of selenium supplementation on symptoms of postpartum depression is unclear. One moderate-sized clinical trial included in this publication shows that taking selenium reduces symptoms of postpartum depression (109091).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces the development of hypertension during pregnancy.\nA small clinical study in pregnant patients shows that drinking a dietary liquid containing selenium 100 mcg daily for 6-8 weeks seems to decrease the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension when compared with placebo (74481).\nless\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM). It is unclear if oral selenium during pregnancy prevents PROM.\nOne clinical trial shows that taking selenium 100 mcg daily from the first trimester of pregnancy until delivery significantly reduces the incidence of PROM to 13%, compared to 34% with placebo (109097).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces diarrhea in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with cervical or endometrial cancer shows that taking selenium 500 mcg on days of radiation therapy and 300 mcg on days without radiation therapy reduces the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea to 20.5%, compared to 44.5% in the control group not taking selenium. This benefit appears to be more pronounced in patients receiving a larger (>1302 mL) planning target volume of radiation (90355).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral selenium reduces RA symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with RA suggests that taking selenized yeast, providing selenium 200 mcg, daily for 90 days does not improve objective measures of RA when compared with placebo. However, there might be small improvements in quality of life measures (9763). Another small clinical study in Iranian patients with moderate to severe RA shows that taking selenium 200 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks in addition to standard treatment reduces patient-reported disease activity, difficulty in performing activities of daily living, and pain severity but does not change the number of tender or swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or disease activity as measured by Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints (DAS28) when compared with placebo (113648).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking a combination of selenium (Nature Made) 200 mcg and a combination probiotic mixture (LactoCare, Zisttakhmir Company) daily for 12 weeks modestly improves general positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not positive or negative scores, when compared with placebo. There were also modest improvements in levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and insulin sensitivity, but not lipid parameters (109087).\nless\nSeborrheic dermatitis. It is unclear if topical selenium disulfide shampoo is beneficial for seborrheic dermatitis.\nA very large observational study in adults with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis suggests that applying selenium disulfide-based shampoo 2-3 times weekly for 4 weeks improves scalp condition and reduces flaking, erythema, and irritation when compared to baseline (113652). The validity of the results is limited by the observational nature of the study and lack of comparator group. A small clinical study in adults with moderate-to-severe seborrheic dermatitis shows that applying selenium disulfide-based 1% shampoo to the scalp once weekly for 8 weeks after a 2-week treatment with corticosteroid and salicylic acid combination therapy reduces relapse rate, erythema, pruritis, adherent dandruff, and total dandruff but does not improve non-adherent dandruff when compared with a placebo shampoo (113646).\nless\nStatin-induced myopathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral selenium may not improve symptoms of myopathy in patients taking statins.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with statin-induced myopathy suggests that taking selenium (SelenoPrecise, Pharma Nord) 200 mcg daily with or without coenzyme Q10 for 3 months does not improve myopathy symptoms when compared with placebo (92908, 92909).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if intravenous selenium improves neurological outcomes following a stroke.\nA small clinical trial in patients with a recent first ischemic stroke shows that intravenous sodium selenite pentahydrate (Selenase, Biosyn, Arzenitmittel GmbH) 2000 mcg after admission and then 1000 mcg daily for 5 days modestly improves some, but not all, measures of neurological deficits when compared with placebo (109088). Another small clinical trial in patients with a recent ischemic stroke shows that the same intervention improves some neurological outcome measures on day 7 or at an earlier discharge, but benefits were not maintained at 3 months (109093). The effects of oral selenium on neurological outcomes following a stroke have not been investigated.\nless\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous selenium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized study in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage shows that administering intravenous selenium 800 mcg and acetylcysteine 1000 mg twice daily starting within 24 hours of admission for 14 days reduces total days spent in the intensive care unit but does not change neurological outcomes, time to reach target sedation, duration of hospital stay, or need for tracheostomy when compared with intravenous placebo. Additionally, no change in radiological outcomes including hematoma or perihematomal edema volume, midline shifting, or the incidence of radiological vasospasm, angioplasty for vasospasm, or hydrocephalus was observed when compared with placebo (113644). It is unclear whether this effect is due to selenium, acetylcysteine, or the combination.\nless\nSuccinylcholine-induced myalgia. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for preventing succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia.\nClinical research in patients receiving succinylcholine for a sinuscopy shows that taking a single dose of selenium 200 mcg 2 hours before anesthesia induction modestly decreases the incidence of postoperative myalgia at 24 hours. In those taking selenium, 95% of patients had no postoperative myalgia, compared with 77.5% of those taking placebo. Postoperative analgesia requirements were also modestly reduced; however, there was no difference in overall pain or the incidence of muscle twitching (109089).\nless\nThyroid cancer. It is unclear if oral selenium reduces the risk of thyroid cancer in most patients.\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding selenium and thyroid cancer risk. This qualified health claim was based on one weak and limited study. The FDA has determined that it is highly uncertain that selenium supplements reduce the risk of thyroid cancer (102373). More recent observational research in postmenopausal individuals using data from the Women's Health Initiative has found that selenium intake at or above the recommended daily allowance from dietary sources or supplements is not associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer (110590).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral selenium is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical study in Iranian adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking selenomethionine 200 mcg daily for 10 weeks in addition to standard therapy improves disease activity and quality of life and increases the percentage of patients with clinical improvement and clinical remission when compared with placebo (113643).\n\nSelenium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in patients with ulcerative colitis shows that taking a liquid supplement containing a combination of selenium, fish oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, acacia, vitamin E, and vitamin C daily for 6 months does not improve disease activity scores when compared with placebo. However, taking the combination supplement seems to reduce the need for oral prednisone for symptom control (13757).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate selenium for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nThe daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for selenium are: 55 mcg for all adults 19 years and older, 60 mcg for pregnant females, 70 mcg for breast-feeding females. Common doses in dietary supplements range from 50 to 200 mcg daily (17516, 74391, 90354)(74412). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nFollowing the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet may lead to selenium deficiency (90357).\nChildren\nOral:\nThe daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of selenium are based on age, and are as follows: 15 mcg for 0-6 months of age; 20 mcg for 6 months to 3 years of age; 30 mcg for 4-8 years of age; 40 mcg for 9-13 years of age; and 55 mcg for 14-18 years of age. Adequate intake for infants is 2.1 mcg/kg daily for 0-6 months and 2.2 mcg/kg daily for 7-12 months (4844). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn clinical research, selenium has been used as an ingredient in a multivitamin or as a stand-alone supplement (14135, 16707).\n\nSelenium dietary supplements contain selenium in different chemical forms. In the majority of supplements, selenium is present as selenomethionine or selenocysteine. Selenomethionine, which cannot be synthesized by humans and is initially synthesized in plants, is incorporated randomly in place of methionine in a variety of proteins obtained from plant and animal sources. However, in multivitamin preparations, infant formulas, protein mixes, weight loss products, and animal feed, sodium selenite and sodium selenate are predominantly used (7836, 7841). Selenium is often provided as selenized yeast (selenomethionine), which is common brewer's yeast that has been grown in selenium-rich media (7838).",

Other clinical research suggests that taking selenium 75 mcg daily, in combination with ascorbic acid 600 mg, alpha-tocopherol 300 mg, and beta-carotene 27 mg, reduces platelet aggregation (74406).\nless\nBARBITURATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, selenium might prolong the sedating effects of barbiturates.\nLaboratory research suggests that selenium can inhibit the hepatic metabolism of barbiturates (14601, 14602). Selenium seems to prolong the sedative effect of pentobarbital in animal models (14601).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nContraceptive drugs might increase levels of selenium, although the clinical significance of this effect is unclear.\nSome research suggests that oral contraceptives increase serum selenium levels in women taking oral contraceptives; however, other research shows no change in selenium levels (14544, 14545, 14546, 101343). It is suggested that an increase could be due to increased carrier proteins, indicating a redistribution of selenium rather than a change in total body selenium (14545).\nless\nGOLD SALTS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nGold salts might interfere with selenium activity in tissues.\nGold forms complexes with selenium, altering its tissue distribution. Theoretically, this might prevent the normal activity of selenium and produce effects equivalent to deficiency (14547, 14548).\nless\nIMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, selenium supplementation may reduce the effectiveness of immunosuppressant therapy.\nIn vitro research and preliminary clinical evidence suggests that selenium may stimulate the immune system (74483, 74445).\nless\nNIACIN\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nSelenium might reduce the beneficial effects of niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.\nA combination of niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) effectively raises HDL cholesterol levels in patients with coronary disease and low HDL levels. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium) along with niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) attenuates this rise in HDL, specifically the HDL-2 and apolipoprotein A1 fractions, by more than 50% in patients with coronary disease (7388, 11537). It is not known whether this adverse effect is due to a single antioxidant such as selenium, or to the combination. It also is not known whether it will occur in other patient populations.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, selenium might interfere with warfarin activity.\nAnimal research suggests that selenium can increase warfarin activity. Selenium might interact with warfarin by displacing it from albumin binding sites, reducing its metabolism in the liver, or by decreasing production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (14541). Selenium can also prolong bleeding times in humans by increasing prostacyclin production, which inhibits platelet activity (14540).\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nSelenium may have antiplatelet effects.\nCombining selenium with other products that have anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects might increase the risk of bleeding.

See products with anticoagulant activity here\n\n.\nless\nASTRAGALUS\nConcomitant use of selenium with astragalus may increase selenium intake.\nSome species of astragalus accumulate large amounts of selenium, especially when grown in selenium-rich soils (14525). Theoretically, consuming preparations of these plants along with selenium supplements could cause selenium toxicity. However, most astragalus supplements contain Astragalus membranaceus, which is not a selenium accumulator.\nless\nCOPPER\nTheoretically, selenium may reduce copper levels.\nPreliminary research suggests that selenium supplementation may alter copper metabolism or increase copper excretion (22542, 74443).\nless\nOMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\nOmega-3 fatty acids might reduce selenium levels.\nPreliminary clinical evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may reduce selenium absorption (74514).\nless\nVITAMIN C\nVitamin C might increase or decrease the absorption of selenium, although this is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nSome evidence suggests that vitamin C can chemically reduce inorganic selenium, such as selenite, selenate salts, and selenium citrate, to elemental selenium. This reduced form of selenium is poorly absorbed from the GI tract (11683, 14527). However, higher-quality clinical research suggests that vitamin C improves the bioavailability of sodium selenite (22538) and does not affect organic forms of selenium such as selenomethionine and selenized yeast (11683, 14527). Therefore, it is unlikely that there is a clinically significant interaction between vitamin C and selenium.\nless\nZINC\nTheoretically, zinc might reduce selenium absorption.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that zinc might reduce selenium absorption, possibly by forming zinc selenite complexes, which are poorly absorbed (11685, 11686).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nAUTOIMMUNE DISEASES\nTheoretically, selenium might exacerbate autoimmune disease by stimulating disease activity. Selenium might have immunostimulant effects (74483, 74445). Advise patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or others to avoid taking selenium supplements.\nless\nHEMODIALYSIS\nSelenium levels can be low in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. In patients with low selenium levels, a dialysis solution with selenium might increase levels somewhat, but concentrations remain below normal. Selenium supplementation might be needed for some patients undergoing dialysis (1805, 11053).\nless\nHYPOTHYROIDISM\nSelenium might exacerbate hypothyroidism in patients with iodine deficiency. However, selenium does not have a significant effect on thyroid function when iodine intake is adequate (1664, 4844). People who are iodine- and selenium-deficient should not receive selenium supplements without concomitant iodine because this might further exacerbate hypothyroidism. In these patients, selenium will increase conversion of T4 to T3, but the thyroid gland will lack iodine to synthesize more T4 (1664, 14563, 14564, 14565, 17508).\nless\nINFERTILITY\nHigh intake of selenium could theoretically decrease male fertility. A diet that is high in selenium might decrease the motility of sperm (9729).\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nTheoretically, selenium might cause excessive bleeding if used perioperatively.

Tell patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer that selenium supplements don't appear to protect against cancer recurrence. It is unclear what effect, if any, selenium supplementation has on melanoma risk.

            "Nutrient Depletions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nCisplatin might reduce selenium levels.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that cisplatin lowers plasma selenium levels in humans (14526, 14568). Levels appear to recover between courses, but the decrease can become progressively larger with each course of the drug. In one study, the decrease was only 1% with the first course, but reached 19% by the fourth course (14568). This might indicate that tissues are becoming progressively more selenium-depleted, so that less is available to replenish plasma levels (14568). The mechanism might involve binding of cisplatin to methylselenol, a selenium metabolite formed in the kidneys, resulting in increased selenium excretion (14569, 14570, 14571). There is not enough data to know whether selenium supplements should be recommended for patients receiving cisplatin. Preliminary evidence suggests selenium supplements do not affect the systemic availability or antitumor actions of cisplatin in animal models (14569, 14571).\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nClozapine might reduce selenium levels.\nLow plasma selenium levels are found in some people treated with clozapine (14542, 14543). Since selenium has antioxidant properties, there is speculation that lowered levels might contribute to agranulocytosis and cardiac side effects of clozapine; however, there are no studies to confirm this. There isn't enough information to recommend routine selenium supplementation with clozapine therapy.\nless\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nCorticosteroids might reduce selenium levels; however, evidence is conflicting.\nReduced plasma levels have been reported, especially with high doses of corticosteroids such as 20 to 60 mg/day of prednisolone (14535). Other studies have shown no change in plasma levels (14534), or even increased plasma levels, sometimes with reduced levels in tissues such as the liver (14536, 14537, 14538, 14539). The increased plasma levels might reflect redistribution from tissues, possibly due to increases in plasma proteins which bind selenium (14537, 14539). Increased levels could also be due to reduced selenium excretion, as a result of the mineralocorticoid effects of corticosteroids (14536, 14538). Whether these changes in selenium levels are clinically significant is not known.\nless\nVALPROATE\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nValproate might reduce selenium levels; however, evidence is conflicting.\nAnimal model research and anecdotal reports suggest that valproate reduces plasma selenium levels, possibly by chelation and increased excretion. Theoretically, this might contribute to valproate side effects (11652, 11653, 14542). However, other studies have found no effect (11658, 14528). There isn't enough data to recommend routine selenium supplements with valproate therapy.\nless",
            "Overdose": "Acute overdose (selenosis): There is no well-defined dosage point at which selenium becomes lethal. Acute selenium poisoning may cause fever, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anorexia) (74510, 74439), liver or kidney functional impairment (74439), muscle tenderness, tremor, facial flushing (4844), respiratory distress, or cardiac complications (74466). There are at least nine reports of accidental death due to acute selenium toxicity and cardiac failure. In one reported case, a patient developed severe, acute toxicity following ingestion of 10 grams of sodium selenite. The patient developed vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, decreased perfusion, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, prolonged QT interval, and fatal cardiac arrest (15127).\nChronic overdose toxicity: Despite the recent findings of environmental contamination, chronic selenium toxicosis in humans is exceedingly rare in the United States, with the few known cases resulting from industrial accidents (74458, 74473) and an episode involving the ingestion of highly potent selenium supplements (74450).\n\nThe level of selenium exposure that will cause chronic toxicity is not known, although doses 4-5 times the normal dietary intake have been implicated. Blood selenium levels can be used to assess the degree of toxicity. Levels below 1000 mcg/L are not usually associated with serious damage, whereas levels above 2000 mcg/L are predictive of serious damage (4844, 7825, 74343).\n\nBased on case reports, chronic selenium toxicity may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, neuromuscular-psychiatric disturbances, headache, memory and concentration problems, joint pain, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle spasms, dermatologic changes, liver dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, immune alterations, and thyroid dysfunction (4844, 17193, 74329, 74376, 74397, 74439, 74495, 113660). Chronic selenium toxicity may be fatal (74376).\nPresentation\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of acute or chronic overdose with selenium.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDiet is the major source of selenium, and approximately 80% of dietary selenium is absorbed, depending on the type of food consumed (74427). L-selenomethionine has been shown to be absorbed more efficiently than parselenium (74451). Selenium-enriched yeast has higher bioavailability than inorganic selenium (74345). Selenomethionine, has nearly twice the bioavailability of selenium as selenite (74354). One pharmacokinetic study in human shows that taking selenomethionine 200 mcg results in peak serum selenium levels at 4 hours, and abundant amounts of selenium in the serum 24 hours post-consumption (17510).\nDistribution\nThe kidney accumulates the highest level of selenium and is the major source of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (74302). Selenium must travel via the gastrointestinal tract, cross the intestinal barrier, reach the blood circulation, and then be distributed to the different tissues of the body, including the skin, which allows for selenium to be metabolized and presented to the entire tissue, potentially in an active form (74379).\n\nIn human research, supplementation with high-selenium yeast results in distribution of selenium mostly into the plasma and erythrocytes, and more modestly into the hair and platelets (74405). The ability of selenomethionine to be incorporated into the body proteins in place of methionine furthermore provides a means of reversible selenium storage in organs and tissues. This property is not shared by any other naturally occurring selenoamino acids and thus could be associated with a specific physiological function of selenomethionine (74332).\n\nA small clinical study suggests that ingestion of selenium as selenomethionine (selenium-enriched yeast) seems to distribute more into the hemoglobin fraction, while ingestion of selenate seems to distribute equally between GSH-Px and hemoglobin (74444). In another very small clinical study, supranutritional supplementation with the inorganic form of selenium, sodium selenate, 10 mg three times daily results in a significant but highly variable increase in selenium concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting distribution and bioavailability to the central nervous system. However, the distribution of selenoproteins as a proportion of total selenium was far greater in the serum compared with the CSF, suggesting that the blood-brain barrier may limit selenium entry into the brain (113658).\nMetabolism\nThe metabolism of selenium by the brain differs from other organs in that at times of deficiency, the brain retains selenium to a greater extent (74315).\nExcretion\nUrinary selenium excretion has been shown to be greater after taking selenomethionine than after taking selenite. Urinary excretion after consuming selenium-rich yeast is intermediate and not significantly different from either selenomethionine or selenite (74370). Selenium from food and supplements is excreted in the urine (74356, 74405).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSelenium is a metallic substance that is available in a variety of chemical compounds. Often selenium is attached to an organic molecule as in selenocysteine, selenomethionine, and kappa-selenocarrageenan. In broccoli, garlic, onions, and other selenium-accumulating plants it is found as Se-methylselenocysteine or selenocystathionine (7833, 7836). In dietary supplements selenium is commonly provided as selenomethionine or in a selenite or selenate salt form (7841). Often selenium is given as selenized yeast, which is common brewer's yeast that has been grown in selenium-rich media (7838). After ingestion as a selenate salt, selenite salt, or as one of the organic forms, selenium must be reduced or metabolized to form hydrogen selenide, an important intermediary form. Selenide is essential for the activity of selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GSH-Px). The primary organic forms of selenium are the amino acid-based selenocysteine and selenomethionine. Selenomethionine is incorporated directly into proteins, because RNA does not differentiate it from methionine (7832, 9718). Selenomethionine serves as a storage form, releasing selenium as the proteins containing it are catabolized (7834, 9718).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSelenium appears to increase cancer cell death by causing apoptosis and by reducing the formation of ROS. The magnitude of the anticancer effects vary substantially among selenium compounds. Selenite has a high potential to cause apoptosis and selenocystamine is lower. Kappa-selenocarrageenan also has the ability to induce apoptosis. Selenomethionine has almost no effect on apoptosis (7827, 7828). Se-methylselenocysteine found in broccoli, garlic, and onions may be better than supplemental selenite in preventing colonic cancer (7833). Epidemiological evidence indicates that lower blood selenium concentrations increases the likelihood of prostate cancer (8734, 8735, 8736). Higher levels of selenium may slow prostate cancer tumor progression (13257). Selenium seems to accumulate in the prostate, and protect against DNA damage and increase apoptosis in cancer cells (13258). Lower selenium blood concentrations have also been associated with colorectal cancer (9726). However, early data suggests that there may be more effective and less toxic forms of organic selenium, for preventing colorectal cancer, than those used previously (9737). Preliminary data suggest that supplementing the diet with selenium can reduce the risk for developing breast cancer, but no benefit has been shown in humans (9690, 9723). The urinary excretion of selenium is increased during cervical cancer, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known (9727).\n\nAnimal research shows that selenium administration might inhibit the development of carboplatin resistance. In mice with ovarian cancer, administration of high doses of sodium selenite prior to administration of carboplatin prevents the development of resistance. Similarly, pre-treatment of tumors with sodium selenite prior to implantation into the mice also prevents the development of resistance to carboplatin (99660).\nAntioxidant effects\nAt plasma concentrations below 1000 mcg/L, selenium activates glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), which reduces oxidative stress by handling free radicals and hydrogen peroxide. At concentrations above 2000 mcg/L selenium paradoxically increases cellular oxidation by promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl free radicals and superoxide. At higher concentrations selenium also promotes the intracellular formation of nitric oxide, which is converted to toxic nitrous oxide (2664, 7825, 7826, 7827, 7828, 7829). To reduce the effect of ROS formation, selenium is often given with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E or vitamin C. Preliminary evidence suggest selenium and vitamin E act synergistically as antioxidants, and may also synergistically inhibit prostate cancer cell growth (11682, 14526). Some data suggest that vitamin E reduces toxicity associated with excessive selenium intake (11683), but a cell culture study found that vitamin E increased the cytotoxic effects of high selenium levels (7841). Conversely, vitamin C appears to reduce the cytotoxicity of selenium (7841).\n\nSelenium is used for arthritis due to its antioxidant effects. It may reduce inflammation by reducing the cellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (2662). In liver transplant, ROS are generated when the organ is re-perfused with blood following a period of extended warm ischemia. Preliminary evidence suggests that the antioxidant action of selenium can decrease liver damage and improve microcirculation (7839). Selenium may act as part of a defense mechanism, decreasing oxidative stress in peptic ulcer disease (7840).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using selenium supplementation to promote bone health, since epidemiologic data has associated higher selenium blood levels with higher bone mineral density and improved bone turnover markers. However, a large clinical study in adults aged 60 to 74 years, most of which had adequate selenium levels at baseline, shows that taking selenium-enriched yeast 100-300 mcg daily for 5 years does not improve markers of bone turnover when compared with baseline (110592).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn cardiovascular disease, selenium may prevent the oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Selenium deficiency has been implicated in the etiology of Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy observed in China, and congestive cardiomyopathy in people on artificial nutrition (2676, 3341). In children with severe deficiency, Keshan disease may also occur (9718). Research in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that selenium supplementation upregulates gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which is implicated in several metabolic pathways including lipid and insulin metabolism. Additionally, selenium upregulates gene expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), which is implicated in glucose transport across membranes, and downregulates expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is integral in cholesterol transport and subsequent development of atherosclerosis (113656).\nFertility effects\nSelenium is required for testosterone biosynthesis and the formation and development of sperm. At least 25 selenoproteins help maintain the cellular integrity of sperm (102968). Low selenium levels have been linked to decreased male fertility.\n\nSelenium also might be implicated in female fertility. Low selenium levels appear to be associated with first trimester or recurrent miscarriages, suggesting selenium possibly prevents early pregnancy loss (3341). During pregnancy, the concentration of selenium in blood usually increases. Supplementing the diet with low doses of iron seems to prevent this increase (10217).\n\nResearch in adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that selenium supplementation downregulates gene expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, both of which are implicated in oocyte fertilization and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, selenium supplementation upregulates gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which are associated with embryo quality and the regulation of several metabolic pathways, steroidogenesis, and ovarian function (113640, 113656).\nGenetic effects\nA small clinical study in pregnant patients with gestational diabetes mellitus shows that taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks increases genetic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-y) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) when compared with placebo. Selenium did not seem to affect expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and lipoprotein(a) (104419).\nHormonal effects\nSelenium plays a major role in the synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland has a higher concentration of selenium than any other organ in the body. Selenium is an essential component of the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase which converts thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) (1665, 9724). In iodine-deficient people, selenium deficiency can exacerbate hypothyroidism (1664, 9724). However, giving selenium alone in this situation can further exacerbate the hypothyroidism because the conversion of T4 to T3 is increased, while the thyroid gland lacks iodine to synthesize more T4 (1664, 14563, 14564, 14565). Selenium may also be able to prevent alterations in thyroid hormone levels that are sometimes observed in patients after trauma (9725).\n\nSelenium is also of interest for other hormonal effects. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), taking selenium 200 mcg daily for 12 weeks seems to reduce levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and testosterone, which suggests improved outcomes in this patient population (104423). Animal research suggests that selenium might stabilize the expression off genes associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway, which is normally suppressed in PCOS with insulin resistance. Researchers theorize that the PI3K/Akt pathway is implicated in insulin signaling and has a significant downstream role in ovarian follicular granulosa cell growth and development (113650).\nImmune system effects\nSelenium improves immunologic function by increasing the activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and promoting the normal growth and development of T helper cells. These actions may be important in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) because selenium deficiency is common in this condition (7829). There is preliminary experimental evidence that selenium inhibits reverse transcriptase and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is also some evidence that selenium may improve subjective feelings of well-being in patients infected with HIV, but it does not appear to affect overall outcomes (3341, 7830, 9719). Selenium deficiency is associated with increased viral shedding in women infected with HIV. Supplementing the diet of these women with selenium may decrease the transmission of AIDS (9720). There is also evidence that suggests that deficiency of selenium may increase inflammatory lung damage caused during influenza virus infection (9728). Selenium also might protect patients infected with hepatitis B or C from developing liver cancer (3341).\n\nDespite limited evidence that selenium could support immune function, a meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults shows that supplementation with selenium for 8 to 48 weeks might modestly benefit natural killer (NK) lysis activity but does not affect immunoglobulin (Ig), white blood cell, or cytokine concentrations, including IgA, IgG, IgM, lymphocytes, B-cells, T-cells, T helper CD4+ cells, T cytotoxic CD8+ cells, natural killer (NK) cells, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or interleukin-2. However, dose-response analysis suggests that there might be modest immunologic benefits in those with low selenium status at baseline, but those benefits become null or adverse after selenium intake exceeded 70 mcg daily (113639).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in whether selenium can slow or reverse degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease and other dementias by reducing oxidative stress. Some observational research found that certain brain regions of patients with Alzheimer disease have lower levels of selenium when compared with control brains. This suggests increased oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration in the brain of these patients (101344). A meta-analysis of 3 small studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease shows that taking selenium as a supplement or as a daily Brazil nut for 12-24 weeks may improve markers of oxidative stress (i.e. plasma malondialdehyde levels) when compared with baseline (110594). However, observational research failed to find reduced risk of dementia after selenium supplementation (93570). This research was limited due to its short duration and imperfect screening methods (93570, 93571).\n\nThere is also research into ingestion of the inorganic form of selenium, selenate. A very small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking high dose sodium selenate may slow white matter atrophy in the human brain (113658).\nPsychological effects\nLow levels of selenium appear to be associated with a greater incidence of depression, anxiety, confusion, and hostility. Some researchers think a high dietary or supplemental intake of selenium might improve mood (3341)."

It also contains the carbohydrates prunelline and prunellin (7122, 101042, 101044, 101046).\nAnti-cancer effects\nSelf-heal is of interest in the treatment of cancer. Some in vitro research suggests that self-heal inhibits the proliferation of endometrial cancer cells. Self-heal seems to inhibit the effects of estrogen in these cells by influencing the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (101045).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSelf-heal is used traditionally for inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

Possible mechanisms of action include a small decrease in fasting blood glucose, as well as anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects (101046).\nLiver protective effects\nAnimal research suggests that self-heal extract protects against acetaminophen-induced liver damage. The liver protection effects of self-heal appear similar to that of milk thistle. It is believed that the flavonoid and phenol constituents of self-heal protect the liver via antioxidant activity (104763).\nOcular effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that self-heal reduces the presence of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial growth factor, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and retinal pigment epithelium cell death after exposure to blue light.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, senna is generally well-tolerated when used short-term in appropriate doses.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain and discomfort, cramps, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, fecal urgency, and urine discoloration.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Skin eruptions.\nCardiovascular\nExcessive use can cause potassium depletion and other electrolyte abnormalities (15425). In theory, this could cause potentially dangerous changes in heart rhythm. A small decrease in heart rate was seen in one clinical study (74587).\nless\nDermatologic\nIn adults, there are rare case reports of skin eruptions associated with senna, including erythema multiforme, fixed drug eruption, lichenoid reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, photosensitivity, and contact dermatitis (96558). Infants and young children given senna products have experienced contact reactions on the buttocks due to prolonged exposure to stool while wearing a diaper overnight. These reactions range from erythema with small blisters, to large fluid-filled blisters with skin sloughing, as occurs with second degree burns (96559). In a case series of children treated with senna for chronic constipation, burn-like reactions occurred in 2.2%, typically with higher doses (mean 60 mg/day, range 35.2 to 150 mg/day) (96558, 96559). These reactions can be avoided by giving senna early in the day, so that bowel movements occur at a time when diapers can be changed quickly (96559).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, senna can cause abdominal pain and discomfort, cramps, bloating, flatulence, nausea, fecal urgency, and diarrhea (15427, 15434, 15435, 15436, 15439, 15440, 15441, 105955). Chronic use has also been associated with \"cathartic colon,\" radiographically diagnosed anatomical changes to the colon such as benign narrowing, colonic dilation, and loss of colonic folds (15428). The clinical relevance of these findings is unclear. Chronic use can also cause pseudomelanosis coli (pigment spots in intestinal mucosa) which is harmless, usually reverses with discontinuation, and is not associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal adenoma or carcinoma (6138). The cathartic properties of senna leaf are greater than the fruit (15430). Thus, the American Herbal Products Association only warns against long-term use of senna leaf (12).\nless\nHepatic\nChronic liver damage, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatitis have been reported following oral use of senna alkaloids, such as in tea made from senna leaves (13057, 13095, 41431, 74560, 74564, 74584, 105956). There is a case report of hepatitis in a female who consumed moderate amounts of senna tea. The patient was a poor metabolizer of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). It's thought that moderate doses of senna in this patient led to toxic hepatitis due to the patient's reduced ability to metabolize and eliminate the rhein anthrone metabolites of senna, which are thought to cause systemic toxicity (13057). There is also a case of liver failure, encephalopathy, and renal insufficiency in a female who consumed 1 liter/day of senna tea, prepared from 70 grams of dried senna fruit, over 3 years (13095). In another case report, a 3-year-old female presented with hepatitis that led to pancytopenia after drinking tea made from 2-3 grams dry senna leaves three times or more weekly for over one year (105956).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn one case report, a 19-year-old male developed anaphylaxis with dyspnea, facial edema, and hives. This reaction was determined to be caused by the senna content in a specific combination product (Delgaxan Plus, Pompadour Ibérica) that the patient ingested (105957).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy, finger clubbing, cachexia, and tetany have been reported from excessive oral senna use in humans (15426, 74580, 74582, 74620, 74625).\nless\nRenal\nNephrocalcinosis has been reported as a result of oral senna overuse (74582).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Taking senna orally is effective for the short-term treatment of constipation.\nSenna is an FDA-approved nonprescription drug marketed for the short-term treatment of constipation in adults and children ages 2 years and older (15429, 15433, 15436, 15441, 15442, 74545, 74607, 74609, 74613, 74615). Senna usually produces a laxative effect 6-10 hours after oral administration (15429, 96559). However, in children ages 3-15 years, mineral oil and lactulose might be more effective (15434, 15435). Taking senna with psyllium is also effective for the short-term treatment of constipation (8424, 74593), with the combination increasing stool moisture to a greater degree than psyllium alone (8424).\n\nIn patients with opioid or loperamide-induced constipation, taking senna appears to be as effective as lactulose, psyllium, and docusate for relieving constipation (15432, 74586, 74644, 74650). Some population research has found that senna may be more effective than docusate, polyethylene glycol, and lactulose for preventing problematic constipation, the need for an enema, and abdominal imaging in pediatric cancer patients receiving opioids (92710).\n\nSenna also seems to be beneficial in chronic constipation. Clinical guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association and American College of Gastroenterology in 2023 give a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of senna over managing chronic idiopathic constipation without senna based on low-quality of evidence conducted over 4 weeks (112859). In geriatric patients, senna plus psyllium is more effective than lactulose for treating chronic constipation (15438, 15439, 15440). Also, a small study in middle-aged adults with chronic idiopathic constipation shows that taking senna (ALOSENN granules) 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks seems to be similarly effective to taking magnesium oxide 500 mg three times daily (105959).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBowel preparation. Taking oral senna might be effective for bowel cleansing before colonoscopy.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials in adults shows that taking senna alone or with other bowel preparations does not improve bowel cleansing before elective colonoscopy when compared with non-senna bowel preparations. However, in a subgroup analysis of 3 clinical studies, taking senna solution alone is about 2.5 times more likely to result in a clean bowel when compared with polyethylene glycol alone (112893). The interpretation of these findings is limited by varied senna dosages and regimens. Additionally, 2 clinical studies that were not included in this meta-analysis show that senna is as effective or more effective than polyethylene glycol for improving bowel cleanse quality (15431, 40088). Conversely, other studies show that polyethylene glycol is superior to senna (40086, 74587, 74606, 74636). It is also unclear if taking senna with polyethylene glycol improves bowel cleansing when compared with polyethylene glycol alone (74583, 74585). Some clinical studies show that senna is as effective as castor oil and bisacodyl for bowel cleansing (74548, 74603, 74624). Although taking senna alone is less effective than sodium phosphate (15431, 74567, 74570, 74653, 92712), some evidence suggests that taking a combination of senna, sodium picosulfate, and polyethylene glycol is more effective than sodium phosphate for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy (74538).\n\nLimited research has also assessed the benefit of adding senna to a preparation regimen for small bowel capsule endoscopy; however, it is unclear whether the addition of senna improves endoscopy outcomes when compared with the preparation regimen alone (96557).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nHyperkalemia. It is unclear if oral senna is beneficial for reducing potassium levels.\nA small, single-center, open-label clinical study in adults in Thailand with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis shows that taking senna 15 mg daily for 2 months reduces predialysis serum potassium levels by approximately 0.3 mEq/L when compared with control (115470).\nless\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of senna for its other uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSenna is typically used in a dose of 17.2 mg sennosides, once or twice daily. The maximum dose is 34.4 mg sennosides twice daily (92719).\nChildren\nOral:\nThe recommended dosing for senna in children is age-based. For those 12 years and older, the usual dose is 17.2 mg sennosides daily (maximum dose: 34.4 mg sennosides twice daily). For those 6-11 years old, the usual dose is 8.6 mg sennosides daily (maximum dose: 17.2 mg sennosides twice daily). For those 2-5 years old, the usual dose is 4.3 mg sennosides daily (maximum dose: 8.6 mg sennosides twice daily). Senna is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age (92719).\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost senna products are standardized to sennoside content.

Other adverse effects of excessive use include development of cachexia, decreased serum globulin, cardiovascular disorders, muscular weakness, osteomalacia, osteoarthropathy, hepatitis, portal vein thrombosis, chronic liver damage, coma, neuropathy, and nephrocalcinosis (4, 6, 13057, 13095, 41431, 74560, 74564, 74584).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with senna.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSennosides are prodrugs, which are not absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Instead, they are activated by bacterial enzymes in the colon. There is very little systemic absorption of senna (15429). Sennosides travel through the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract without chemical modification, and their hydrophilic nature protects them from absorption by gut epithelial cells (15429, 74600, 74628).\nMetabolism\nUpon reaching the large intestine (colon), sennosides are immediately metabolized by the beta-glucosidases of the microflora (74600, 74633) to form their corresponding glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. However, a study with 14C-labeled rhein anthrone administered intracecally to rats revealed that the compound is scarcely absorbed (74633). Sennosides are split in the intestine by various species of intestinal bacteria to sennidins and anthrones, with subsequent oxidation to anthraquinones outside of the large intestine (30745). Once the rhein anthrone is formed, it is not further metabolized by bacteria and is absorbed as anthrone by the intestinal epithelial cells.\nExcretion\nExperiments with radiochemical anthranoids show a significant clearance of tissue-bound activity of all organs, except the kidneys, which exhibit a pronounced retention of anthranoid equivalents (30725). Senna is excreted through urine (74630).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of senna are the leaf and fruit (15430). Senna contains mainly sennosides, which are high molecular weight dianthrone glycosides. Sennosides are prodrugs, which are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. They are hydrolyzed by enteric bacteria to produce active rhein monoanthrones, which increase colon motility by a selective action at the nerve plexus of intestinal smooth muscle. This occurs 6-10 hours after ingestion of senna and results in elimination of feces (15429, 96558, 96559).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSenna leaf and fruit contain sennosides, which are stimulant laxatives. The cathartic properties of the leaf are greater than the fruit (15430). Senna is thought to exert its laxative effect by a selective action at the nerve plexus of intestinal smooth muscle, which increases colonic motility and speeds colonic transit (96558, 96559). Other proposed mechanisms include modulation of prostaglandins and serotonin in the colon (15429, 15432). Senna usually produces a laxative effect 6-10 hours after oral administration (15429, 96559).\n\nAnthroid laxatives such as senna can have direct toxic effects on the colonic mucosa, causing inflammation and increased cell death. However, anthroid laxatives do not seem to be associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal adenoma or carcinoma (6138, 15425)."

    "Serine": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Serine is a nutritionally nonessential amino acid that is synthesized by the body or provided by foods. Serine occurs in two enantiomer forms: L-serine and D-serine. L-Serine is the form that occurs naturally in proteins. D-serine is formed in the body via the racemization of L-serine. D-Serine functions as a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which play a role in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (102201, 102208, 102218, 102225, 102227).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when L-serine is used orally in food amounts. Average dietary consumption of L-serine from combined food and supplemental sources ranges from 3.5-8 grams daily (91405).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in medicinal amounts. D-serine 30 mg/kg (about 2 grams) orally daily for 6-16 weeks or 60 mg/kg (about 4 grams) daily for 4 weeks has been used with apparent safety (102202, 102206, 102214, 102215, 102237). L-serine up to 400 mg/kg (about 25 grams) daily for up to 1 year has been used with apparent safety (102204, 102220, 108550).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large doses. L-serine in doses greater than 400 mg/kg (about 25 grams) daily has caused reversible side effects including nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, and seizures (102204). D-serine 120 mg/kg (about 8 grams) or more daily might increase the risk of nephrotoxicity (102215).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available. Animal research in lactating mice shows that dietary L-serine transfers to milk and increases free L-serine while decreasing glutamic acid, L-alanine, D-alanine, and taurine levels in milk. However, this does not affect serine levels in the offspring (102228). It is unknown what effect supplemental serine may have in humans. Avoid using in amounts greater than those found in food.",

Meta-analyses of small clinical studies suggest that oral D-serine, taken with standard antipsychotic therapy, may improve positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.\nObservational research has found that patients with schizophrenia have lower serum D-serine levels when compared with healthy controls (102201). Results from several small clinical trials assessing the impact of oral D-serine supplements on symptoms of schizophrenia are mixed (102202, 102208, 102214, 102215, 102216, 102217, 102237). However, meta-analyses of these and other small clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia show that taking D-serine as adjunct to antipsychotic therapy modestly improves negative symptoms when compared with placebo (102201, 102214, 102224). Some analyses have also found an improvement in positive symptoms (102201). Doses of D-serine assessed in clinical studies include 30 mg/kg daily for 4-12 weeks (102202, 102208, 102215), 60-120 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks (102215), and 2 grams daily for 6-16 weeks (102214, 102216, 102217, 102237).\n\nLimited research shows that serine supplementation alone is inferior to antipsychotic treatment. A small clinical study in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia shows that taking D-serine 3 grams daily for 10 weeks is less effective for improving symptoms than olanzapine 30 mg (102203).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral serine is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease.\nA small observational study in a group of patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment has found that increased blood levels of D-serine are associated with improved cognition, especially improved word recall, orientation, comprehension, and word-finding difficulty (102221). However, not all research agrees. Another small observational study in patients with Alzheimer disease found no correlation between levels of D-serine in cerebrospinal fluid and Alzheimer disease or level of cognitive function (102198).\n\nWhile clinical trials on the use of serine alone for improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease are lacking, serine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for this purpose. A small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking a combination of L-serine 12.35 grams, N-acetyl cysteine 2.55 grams, nicotinamide riboside 1 gram, and L-carnitine tartrate 3.73 grams once daily for 4 weeks then twice daily for 8 weeks improves cognitive function, as measured using the ADAS-Cog score, in patients with greater baseline cognitive impairment when compared with placebo. However, taking this combination product did not improve cognitive function in patients with lower cognitive impairment at baseline (110623). It is unclear if these effects are due to serine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if oral L-serine is beneficial in patients with ALS.\nObservational research in patients with ALS has found that taking L-serine 0.5-15 grams twice daily for 4 months is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the rate of disease progression when compared with historical controls (102200).\nless\nBack pain. Oral L-serine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with chronic low back pain and knee pain that is primarily neuropathic in nature shows that taking L-serine 594 mg with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 149 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases back pain scores by 50% at week 8, compared with a 30% reduction in those taking placebo. However, there was no difference between groups at 4 weeks, and improvements were not maintained 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation (105831). It is unclear if these effects are due to serine, EPA, or the combination.\nless\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is unclear if oral serine is beneficial in patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking L-serine 3 grams at bedtime daily for 2 weeks does not alter sleep habits, including bedtime, wake time, and time in bed, when compared with placebo. However, dim light melatonin onset, used as a marker of the circadian phase, was delayed in the placebo group, but not in the L-serine group, suggesting that L-serine may attenuate circadian phase delay (111267). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and short duration. Further, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders.\nless\nCognitive function. Small clinical studies suggest that a single dose of oral D-serine may improve some, but not all, measures of cognitive function in adults.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of D-serine 2.1 grams improves attention, vigilance, and verbal memory, but not visual memory, when compared with placebo (102219). Another small clinical study in healthy older adults shows that taking a single dose of D-serine 30 mg/kg improves spatial memory, learning, and problem solving, but does not affect executive function, working memory, or visual attention, when compared with placebo (102197). These studies are limited by small sample size and short duration.\n\nSerine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for this purpose. A small clinical study in healthy adults with fatigue shows that taking serine, alanine, glutamate, aspartate, and tyrosine daily for 4 weeks improves measures of cognitive function including attention, spatial cognition, orientation, motivation, and time management when compared with placebo (111249). It is unclear if these effects are due to serine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral serine is beneficial in patients with depression.\nA small observational study in patients with major depressive disorder has found that lower concentrations of D-serine in the cerebrospinal fluid are associated with greater depression severity. However, when cerebrospinal fluid levels of L-serine or D-serine were compared between healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder, there was no significant between-group difference (102211).\nless\nFatigue. Oral serine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with fatigue shows that taking serine, alanine, glutamate, aspartate, and tyrosine daily for 4 weeks does not improve subjective or objective measures of fatigue when compared with placebo (111249).\nless\nHereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.

Although there has been interest in using oral serine for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of serine for this purpose.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral L-serine is beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nA small clinical study in healthy patients dissatisfied with their sleep shows that taking L-serine 3 grams 30 minutes before going to bed seems to improve falling asleep, staying asleep, and subjective sleep quality when compared with placebo (102212). It is uncertain if patients with insomnia would also have the same benefits from L-serine.\nless\nKnee pain. Oral L-serine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with knee pain and chronic low back pain that is primarily neuropathic in nature shows that taking L-serine 594 mg with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 149 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases knee pain scores by 36% and 43% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively, compared with changes of 24% and 29%, respectively, in those taking placebo. At 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation, pain reductions were maintained in both groups (105831). It is unclear if these effects are due to serine, EPA, or the combination.\nless\nMuscle fatigue. Oral serine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy male volunteers shows that taking serine 200 mg, arginine 3600 mg, and valine 2200 mg daily for 14 days reduces fatigue and perceived exertion after 120 minutes on a cycle ergometer when compared with placebo (102234). It is unclear if these findings are due to serine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nParkinson disease.

Animal research shows that high doses of D-serine can cause acute tubular necrosis. While nephrotoxicity with D-serine use has not been reported in humans, some small clinical studies show that taking D-serine 60-120 mg/kg daily may cause proteinuria and abnormal markers of kidney function in a small number of patients (102230).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with serine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe peak concentration of D-serine in the blood seems to occur about an hour after oral administration (102215).\nMetabolism\nThe enzyme serine racemase (SR) converts L-serine to D-serine and vice versa. D-amino acidoxidase (DAAO) quickly catabolizes and deaminates D-serine into pyruvic acid. DAAO controls the level of serine in the brain and decreases bioavailability of orally administered serine. When NMDA receptors are overstimulated, nitric oxide is produced, which activates DAAO and suppresses SR activity (102204, 102224).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSerine exists in two enantiomer forms: L-serine and D-serine. L-serine is found in dietary protein and it also synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate. L-serine can be synthesized into the amino acids glycine and cysteine. Inside cells, L-serine is racemized into D-serine. D-serine is a selective endogenous co-agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. These receptors are found in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and other areas in the brain (102201, 102208, 102218, 102225, 102227).\nCardiovascular effects\nDietary serine attenuates the increase in homocysteine caused by ingestion of methionine. A small clinical study in healthy males shows that consuming L-methionine 30 mg/kg with L-serine 60.6 mg/kg reduces homocysteine levels by 37% when compared with methionine alone (102235).\nCognitive effects\nThere has been interest in correlating D-serine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid or serum with Alzheimer disease (102221, 105830). One study in patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment found that increased blood levels of D-serine are associated with improved cognition (102221). Conversely, a large meta-analysis in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that D-serine levels in both the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid are significantly higher than those in a control group; an inverse relationship was observed between D-serine levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (105830). Other observational research has not identified a correlation between D-serine levels and Alzheimer disease or cognitive function (102198).\n\nSome researchers theorize that serine enhances cognitive function by acting as a precursor for sphingolipids and glycolipids, essential membrane and myelin constituents (111249).\n\nIn animal studies, decreased D-serine levels have been associated with age-related decline in learning and memory (102197). These age-related declines can be improved by stimulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is conditionally done by D-serine. Age-related decreases in D-serine tissue levels result in less serine racemase expression, less NMDA stimulation, and therefore less functional plasticity. Animal models have shown that this deficit might be corrected by D-serine supplementation (102199).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that oral D-serine might play a role in the prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model of IBD, D-serine prevented colonic inflammation when administered before induction of colitis and suppressed the progression of colitis when given after disease induction (108549).\nNeurological effects\nD-serine is a co-agonist of glutamate at the glycine site of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are ionotropic receptors. There is considerable interest in NMDA agonists for enhancing memory and for alleviating neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia. Serine might also be a gliotransmitter that mediates interactions between glia and neurons. In addition to its effect in the central nervous system, there is interest in the function of D-serine in peripheral tissues and visceral organs (102218, 102222, 102225, 102227, 102232).\n\nDopaminergic hyperactivity is thought to be the main cause of psychosis in schizophrenia. However, clinical trials have shown that glutamatergic NMDA antagonists such as ketamine can cause psychosis by affecting dopaminergic neurotransmission in a complex way. There is interest in NMDA receptor agonist modulators such as serine for improving positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (102222, 102224). There is also interest in using serine to improve auditory processing, which is a concern observed in some patients with schizophrenia (111269).\n\nDysfunctional glutamatergic signaling and deficient glial reuptake of glutamate are also thought to contribute to depression. D-serine is thought to help regulate synaptic plasticity and improve glutamatergic neuronal and glial signaling. Animal research in rodents with depleted serotonin shows that administration of serine reduces depressive symptoms such as immobility, behavior of learned helplessness, and deficits in sexual-reward seeking (102223, 102229). Also, a small clinical observational study has found that baseline plasma D-serine concentrations were lower in ketamine responders than non-responders. This suggests that levels of D-serine can help predict response to ketamine treatment for depression (102226).\n\nThere is also interest in using amino acids such as L-serine for hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1), which presents as lower limb sensory loss preceded by extreme pain. This disease is caused by a mutation in C133Y serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)-LC1 gene, which causes increased neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids (dSLs) formation. In vitro, animal and limited human research suggests that increased L-serine reduces formation of dSLs which might attenuate severity of HSAN1 symptoms (102204, 102205).\n\nThere is also interest in using serine to improve sleep. Preliminary research suggests that L-serine might have effects on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor to improve sleep (102212)."

It is unclear if this reaction was due to sesame, other ingredients, or other factors.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nThere was a single case of diarrhea associated with oral sesame in a clinical trial (108356).\nless\nImmunologic\nMultiple cases of allergic response to sesame seed occurring after occupational, topical, intramuscular, or oral exposure have been reported (28157, 28158, 28159, 28160, 28161, 28162, 28163, 28166, 28167, 28183)(28184, 28185, 28186, 28188, 108348). One study found that up to 0.5% of the United States population reports having a sesame allergy, and 0.23% of the population meets criteria for an IgE-mediated allergic reaction to sesame (100501). Allergic symptoms may be dermatologic, such as angioedema (28160, 28167, 108348), cheilitis (28207), dermatitis (28157, 28166, 28182, 28185, 28186), edema (28159), erythema (28167), pruritis (28167, 108348), purpura (28188), flushing (108348), and urticaria (28159, 28160, 28162, 108348); musculoskeletal (28188); respiratory, such as asthma (28159, 28162), rhinitis (28162), wheezing (28167), and general breathing difficulties (108348); gastrointestinal, such as vomiting (28159, 108348); and others such as conjunctivitis (28159), anaphylactic shock (28157, 28159, 28160, 28167, 28177, 28178, 28179, 28180, 28204, 108348), and hemodynamic modifications (28169). In Canada, sesame accounted for 4% of pediatric food-induced anaphylaxis reactions presenting to emergency departments over a 10-year period. The majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity and occurred within 2 hours of exposure; however, about 3% occurred 2-8 hours after exposure. Epinephrine was the most common treatment, followed by antihistamines, inhaled beta-agonists, and corticosteroids (108348).\n\nApproximately one-third of patients with IgE-mediated sesame allergy have reported previous use of epinephrine due to this allergy (100501). There is evidence that IgE-mediated sesame allergy is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors; there was a high correlation of the allergy between family members, especially siblings (28175).\n\nAllergens believed to be responsible for sesame seed hypersensitivity include beta-globulin (28213); sesamol, sesamolin, and sesamin (28182, 28207); storage proteins including ses i 1 and ses i 2 (2S albumins) (28132, 28187, 28211, 28212, 28216, 28217), ses i 3 (a 7S vicilin-type globulin) (28187, 28214), ses i 4 (28158), ses i 5 (28158), ses i 6 (an 11S globulin) (28132, 28215), and ses i 7 (28215).

One meta-analysis of eight clinical studies shows that sesame or sesamin can reduce SBP by 8 mmHg and DBP by 6 mmHg when compared with control. In a subgroup analysis of patients with hypertension, reductions in SBP and DBP were 11 mmHg and 9 mmHg, respectively. In a subgroup analysis by formulation, sesame oil was shown to reduce SBP and DBP by 13 mmHg and 10 mmHg, respectively, while whole sesame seed, ground seed, or sesame supplement lowered SBP by only 3 mmHg and did not lower DBP (96179). Another meta-analysis of clinical studies involving patients with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, or kidney failure shows that taking sesame oil reduces SBP and DBP by 3 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, although benefits were limited to studies of less than 8 weeks (108355).\n\nSome research on sesame oil involved replacing other cooking oils with a specific brand of sesame oil (Idhayam Gingelly oil, V.V.V. & Sons) 35 grams daily for about 6-9 weeks.

It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for cognitive impairment.\nClinical research in older adults with memory impairment shows that taking sesame oil cake extract (Keukdong H-Pharm Co., Ltd.) 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks modestly improves some, but not all, measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo (108351). In addition, preliminary clinical research in patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking two capsules of a combination product containing the sesame constituent sesamin 5 mg and astaxanthin 3 mg daily for 12 weeks increases psychomotor and processing speed when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on memory, attention, or overall severity of cognitive symptoms (99863). It is not clear if these effects are due to sesamin, astaxanthin, or the combination.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sesame oil or pulling the oil through the teeth is beneficial for dental plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 12-14 years of age shows that rinsing with 10 mL of ozonated or non-ozonated sesame oil for 10 minutes daily for 15 days reduces plaque when compared with baseline. The ozonated sesame oil was superior to non-ozonated sesame oil, showing a similar improvement in plaque when compared with chlorhexidine mouthwash (103226). A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that pulling sesame oil 10 mL through the teeth for 15-20 minutes twice daily for 4 days has similar effects on full-mouth prevention of plaque regrowth, tooth staining, gingival index, and bleeding when compared with pulling coconut oil through the teeth (106038).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral sesame oil is beneficial for diabetes.\nMeta-analyses suggest that taking sesame for 6-12 weeks modestly reduces levels of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), but not insulin levels or insulin resistance, when compared with placebo, baseline, or other control. Sesame oil and seed flour, tahini, and sesamin were used in the included research (108350, 108352, 108355). Although most studies included in these meta-analyses were conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes, one study (103231) was conducted in patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\nOne small clinical trial included in these meta-analyses shows that replacing other cooking oils with a specific brand of sesame oil (Idhayam Gingelly oil, V.V.V. & Sons) 35 grams daily for 45 days reduces blood glucose levels and HbA1c when compared with baseline in patients with diabetes who are also using glibenclamide (27654).\n\nSesame oil has also been investigated in combination with rice bran oil. One preliminary clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes not using antidiabetes medications shows that using a specific 20:80 blend of sesame oil and rice bran oil (Vivo, Adani Wilmar) as the only cooking oil for 8 weeks reduces levels of fasting blood glucose by 14% and reduces HbA1c when compared with baseline. In patients taking glibenclamide 5 mg daily, using this oil blend reduces fasting blood glucose and HbA1c when compared with glibenclamide alone (96177).\n\nThe use of sesame oil has also been investigated for improving cardiometabolic markers in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical research in adults taking antidiabetes medications shows that replacing regular dietary oils with sesame oil or a blend of sesame and canola oils for 9 weeks does not improve most cardiometabolic markers when compared with canola oil or sunflower oil as a control (108353).\nless\nGastric cancer. Although there is interest in using oral sesame for gastric cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this purpose.\nGingivitis. It is unclear if pulling sesame oil through the teeth is beneficial for gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adolescent males with plaque-induced gingivitis shows that oil pulling with sesame oil for one minute daily each morning prior to brushing for 10 days reduces dental plaque and gingivitis when compared with baseline (27648). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHemorrhoids. Topical sesame oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in adults with symptomatic mild to moderate (first- and second-degree) internal hemorrhoids shows that application of a cream containing sesame oil and aqueous extracts of guggul and Allium ampeloprasum as a thin layer to the anus twice daily for 3 weeks improves anal irritation and itching, bleeding, pain, defecation discomfort, and swelling sense when compared with baseline. In contrast, patients using a placebo cream experienced an improvement only in anal itching (105751). The poor study methodology and lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral sesame has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with HIV shows that consuming 300 grams of a chickpea and sesame-based food supplement daily for 3 months, along with routine sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, improves weight gain, body mass index, and mid-upper arm circumference in 73% of patients, and results in improved physical performance in 78% of patients, when compared to baseline (27657). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of a limited number of clinical studies that included mainly patients without hyperlipidemia shows that consuming sesame 25-50 grams daily or using sesame oil 3.5-35 grams daily for up to 10 weeks does not reduce levels of total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with baseline (96181). However, a more recent meta-analysis with similar studies shows that consuming sesame reduces levels of total cholesterol by 16 mg/dL, although there is no effect on levels of LDL cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (108357). Both analyses show that taking sesame reduces triglyceride levels by about 21 mg/dL (96181, 108357). Significant heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations limits the validity of these results.\nless\nInsect repellent. Although there is interest in using topical sesame oil as an insect repellent, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this purpose.\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for male infertility.\nPreliminary clinical research in males with infertility shows that taking sesame 0.5 mg/kg daily for 3 months modestly improves sperm count and motility, but not sperm morphology, when compared with baseline (108356). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there is interest in using oral sesame for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this purpose.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral sesame oil is beneficial for improving metabolic parameters in adults with metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking sesame oil 30 mL with or without vitamin E 400 mg daily for 8 weeks improves levels of fasting blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure when compared with sunflower oil. In those taking sesame oil alone, total cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced by about 13 mg/dL, while low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were not affected. In those also taking sesame oil with vitamin E, total cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced by 17 mg/dL and 21 mg/dL, respectively, while HDL cholesterol was increased by 4 mg/dL. Additionally, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 10 mmHg and 8 mmHg, respectively, in those taking sesame oil alone, versus 15 mmHg and 9 mmHg, respectively, in those taking sesame oil with vitamin E (103231).\nless\nMiscarriage. It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for the management of an incomplete miscarriage.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with incomplete abortion related to miscarriage shows that taking sesame seed twice daily for 5 days results in complete resolution of retained products of conception in 84% of individuals, based on a sonographic assessment, compared with 26% of those receiving expectant management as control. There was also a 2-day reduction in the duration of vaginal bleeding when compared with control. Each dose of ground sesame seed powder 30 grams was boiled in 200 mL water for 4 minutes and then filtered before drinking (108346).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral sesame oil is beneficial for NAFLD.\nClinical research in females with NAFLD shows that taking sesame oil 30 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces the severity of fatty liver in 89% of patients taking sesame oil, compared with 58% of those taking sunflower oil. There were also modest reductions in levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), but not alkaline phosphatase (ALP), when compared with sunflower oil. All patients were also consuming a 500-kcal hypocaloric diet (108354).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for weight loss.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking sesame or sesame oil in doses of at least 35 grams daily reduces body weight by up to 2 kg and body mass index by up to 1 kg/m2 when compared with no oil or a control oil. Clinical studies included in these meta-analysis enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and others, and were not limited to overweight or obese individuals (108355, 108357). A small clinical study in overweight individuals shows that replacing regular dietary oil with sesame oil for 9 weeks does not improve levels of most cardiometabolic risk factors, although there were modest beneficial effects on insulin (108349).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical sesame oil is beneficial for knee osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that applying sesame oil 1.5 mL to the affected knee three times daily for 4 weeks reduces pain and improves physical function when compared to baseline. These improvements were similar to those seen in patients applying diclofenac topical gel (103228).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there is interest in using oral sesame for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this condition.\nPain (acute). It is unclear if massage with topical sesame oil is beneficial for acute pain caused by blunt trauma.\nOne small clinical study shows that using a specific sesame oil (Saman sesame oil, Saman sesame oil Co.) topically as part of a light massage for 5 minutes twice daily for 9 days moderately reduces acute pain caused by blunt trauma to an extremity by day 6 when compared with a light massage with placebo oil. However, the sesame oil massage does not reduce the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when compared with placebo oil (96178). A similar clinical study in the same population shows that using sesame oil extracted from tahini topically as part of a light massage for 5 minutes 3 times a day for 2 days improves pain severity, pain sensitivity, and heaviness of the painful site by about 20% when compared with baseline (106034). The lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral sesame for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this purpose.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral sesame is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with RA shows that taking the sesame constituent sesamin (Sesamin, Scivation, Inc.) 200 mg daily for 6 weeks improves physical function and reduces pain, the number of tender and swollen joints, and markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein when compared with placebo (103230).\nless\nStroke. Although there is interest in using oral sesame for stroke, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sesame for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate sesame for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSesame oil has most often been used in doses of up to 35 grams daily for 6-12 weeks.

There is also some evidence that sesame oil has additive effects in patients also taking atenolol, nifedipine, and/or hydrochlorothiazide (27652, 27654, 27655, 96179, 108355, 108357). In patients using nifedipine, using a blend of sesame oil and rice bran oil for cooking reduces both SBP and DBP more than nifedipine alone (96180).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, sesame might increase the levels and clinical effects of CYP2C9 substrates.\nIn vitro, sesame inhibits CYP2C9 (11028).

However, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nTAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, sesame might interfere with tamoxifen.\nIn animal research, sesame seed reduces the tumor-inhibitory effect of tamoxifen by reducing apoptosis and increasing proliferation (28110, 28111). This interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nTheoretically, sesame oil might have hypoglycemic effects.\nSesame oil might decrease plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, with additive effects in patients already taking antidiabetes medications (27654, 28139, 96177, 108350, 108352, 108355).

Tell patients to discontinue using medicinal amounts of sesame at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with sesame.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, consumption of sesame seeds (containing omega-6 fatty acids) increased serum omega-6 fatty acids and plasma and urinary lignans (22180, 28259). In animal research, the form of sesame affected plasma concentrations of sesame lignans (28322). Dietary tahini and dietary sesame perisperm resulted in increased plasma concentrations of enterodiol and enterolactone when compared to raw sesame (39829).\nDistribution\nIn animal research, sesame oil (containing oleic acid) increased oleic acid levels in aorta and platelets (28324) and stearic acid accumulated in liver, heart, and adipose tissue (28329). In animal research, sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites (sesaminol, sesaminol sulfate, and sesaminol glucuronide) were increased in tissue following consumption of sesame meal; levels were increased in the liver and small intestine if the sesame meal had first been nano- or submicrosized (28323). In animal research, feeding defatted sesame flour resulted in an increase in sesaminol in peripheral tissues (27690).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, consumption of a single dose of sesame oil, containing sesamin 508 mcM, resulted in the presence of sesamin metabolites in the urine, including the major sesamin catechol metabolite (1R,2S,5R,6S)-6-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo-[3,3,0]octane, which made up 38.6% of the ingested dose (28325). In the plasma, the major sesamin metabolite following consumption of sesame seeds was enterolactone (28326) and conversion to other mammalian lignans has been shown in vitro (28122). In healthy postmenopausal adults, sesame seed constituents were converted to mammalian lignans by the bacterial flora in the colon (28327). In animal research, sesaminol triglucoside was converted by intestinal microbiota to 4-[((3R,4R)-5-(6-hydroxybenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)methyl]benzene-1,2-diol and could be converted to the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol (28328). In animal research, stearic acid from sesame oil was converted to palmitic and myristic acids (28329).\nExcretion\nIn humans, consumption of sesame seeds increased urinary lignans, such as enterolactone and enterodiol (22180, 27646, 28122).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSesame contains lignans, including sesamin, episesamin, and sesamolin (28182, 28192, 28207, 96181). Analysis of 65 different samples of sesame seeds shows that the seeds contain sesaminol triglucoside 36-1560 mg per 100 grams of seed and sesaminol diglucoside 0-493 mg per 100 grams of seeds (28190). The total phytosterol content of sesame seed is 400-413 mg per 100 grams (28191), and the total plant lignan concentration is 2180 mcM per 100 grams (28122). Sesame seeds are a rich source of protein (108352). Sesame oil contains some saturated fat but is highest in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Sesame oil also contains vitamin E (96178, 96181, 108352).\nAnalgesic effects\nSesame oil is used topically for pain. In animals, a sesame seed extract inhibits the acetic acid-induced writhing response, comparable to that of ibuprofen (27666).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSesame oil has anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory research. In animal research, sesame oil reduced oxidative stress and biochemical changes in a model of arthritis and decreased hind paw edema (27679). The constituent sesamin protects against inflammatory agents like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in animal models (27680). Potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of sesamin include a decreased activity of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1-beta (27676, 27677, 27680) and decreased activity of leukocytes through ERK1/2- and NF-kappaB-related signaling pathways (27683). However, in human research, sesame or sesamin consumption reduces levels of IL-6, but not TNF-alpha or C-reactive protein (CRP) (108347). Sesamin also protects against the apoptotic effects of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (27677). Sesamin and other sesame lignans seem to alter metabolism of fatty acids, resulting in decreased formation and activity of proinflammatory prostaglandins (27673, 28222, 28224, 28334, 27681, 27682), Whether, sesame oil has these benefits is still not known. Some research in humans and animals suggests that sesame oil does not affect levels of some inflammatory mediators or markers of systemic inflammation (27646, 27678, 28225).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, sesame oil and/or sesame had antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (27668, 55030) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (27668). In animal research, pretreatment with sesame reduced the lethality of bacterial infection, possibly due to host-mediated action (27670).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSesame oil and other sesame formulations have been shown to have hypoglycemic effects in clinical research (27654, 28138, 28139, 96177, 108350, 108352, 108355). Animal research suggests that delayed glucose absorption may be responsible for this effect (28138). However, a clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving treatment with oral antidiabetic agents shows that replacement of household dietary oil intake with sesame oil has no significant effect on markers of glycemic control when compared with canola oil or a blend of both canola and sesame oils (106035).\nAntifungal effects\nSesame and some of its constituents have been shown to have antifungal effects. In vitro, an extract from sesame leaf inhibits Candida albicans (27668). Antifungal of properties of various sesame constituents, including chlorosesamone, hydroxysesamone, sesamin, sesamol, and 2,3-epoxysesamone have been demonstrated (27671, 27672, 27673, 27674). Effects of sesamol likely result from its metabolism (27674).\nAntihypertensive effects\nHypotensive effects of sesame and its constituents have been demonstrated in human, animal, and in vitro research. In humans, using sesame oil in place of other cooking oils or taking the sesame constituent sesamin has been shown to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although the effect did not last once the treatment was stopped (27651, 27652, 27654, 27655, 96179, 108355, 108357). In healthy humans, a single dose of tahini reduces pulse rate and blood pressure, possibly by improving endothelial function. There was no effect on intercellular cell-adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular cell-adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), or E-selectin (109473). In hypertensive rats, both sesamin and isolated peptides attenuated an elevation in blood pressure and improved endothelial and vascular dysfunction and thrombotic tendency (28130, 28131, 28140, 28141, 28142, 28143, 28144, 28145, 28146, 28147). Mechanisms of action may include vasodilation due to increased nitric oxide activity (28140, 28297, 28298), inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme involved in the regulation of body fluids (28141), and reduction in plasma and urinary 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, likely via inhibition of CYP4F2 by sesame lignans (28223). However, there is some evidence from human and animal research suggesting that the antihypertensive effects of sesame are not consistent (27646, 28296).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn humans, epidemiological and case-control studies demonstrate a decreased risk of stomach cancer in individuals who frequently consumed sesame oil (4112, 28103). In animal models, sesame extract, sesame oil, and the constituents allomelanin, sesamol, sesamin, sesaminol, and episesamin have been shown to reduce tumor formation, growth, and metastasis, and increase survival (27642, 27682, 28104, 28105, 28106, 28107, 28109, 28112, 28113). Laboratory research suggests that these constituents of sesame induce growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells (27675, 28105, 28114, 28115, 28116, 72232, 72247).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of sesame components are thought to play a role in the potential clinical effects of sesame and sesame oil (108354, 108355). In human research, sesame oil reduced levels of malondialdehyde (108355).\nBone effects\nSesame might improve bone density. In animal models, sesame oil has prevented bone loss and improved bone density and strength (28110, 28111, 28299).\nCardiovascular effects\nSesame oil is rich in cardioprotective monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In some but not all animal models, sesame oil protects against the development of atherosclerotic lesions and improves blood lipid levels (28155, 28230, 99864). These effects may be due to the reduced expression of inflammatory genes and induction of the genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport, which have been demonstrated with sesame oil and its aqueous extract in animal models of atherosclerosis (99864). Sesame oil also stimulates the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2), potentially improving vascular function (28303). The constituent sesamin prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy associated with renal impairment (28300).\nHepatic effects\nIn animal models, sesame oil and sesame constituents have hepatoprotective effects (28222, 28236, 28237, 28238, 28244). These benefits are likely related to the antioxidant effects of sesame oil and the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (27693, 28238, 28242, 28243, 28244, 28245). A clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving treatment with oral antidiabetic agents shows that replacement of household dietary oil intake with sesame oil has no significant effect on liver function enzymes when compared with canola oil or a blend of both canola and sesame oils (106035).\nLipid effects\nSesame seeds, sesamin, and sesame oil have been shown to decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in some human and animal research (12358, 27649, 27652, 27654, 27655, 27686) (27690, 28133, 28149, 28150, 28155, 28156, 78961). Potential mechanisms of action may involve the sesame fiber, sterol, and polyphenol constituents on hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and bile acid content, possibly reducing cholesterol formation and increasing excretion (27687, 28153, 96181) and decreasing the secretion of triglycerides from the liver (28304).\nNeurologic effects\nSesame is sometimes used for dementia. In animal models, sesame constituents reduce plasma levels of amyloid-beta (108351), prevent oxidative damage of the brain and improve locomotor activity and motor coordination (28124, 28125), protect against bradykinesia and catalepsy (28315), and attenuate stress-induced depressive-like behaviors (103229). Sesame oil and the sesame constituents protect against learning and memory deficits (27664, 28253). In animal and in vitro models, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity has been found to play a role in the neuroprotective effects of sesame, sesame oil, and their constituents (27664, 27665, 28120, 28121, 28127, 28247, 28248, 28251, 28314, 28316)(28317, 81431, 103229).\nWeight effects\nA clinical study in healthy adults and in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving treatment with oral antidiabetic agents shows that replacement of household dietary oil intake with sesame oil has no significant effect on body weight or other body composition indices when compared with canola oil or a blend of both canola and sesame oils (106036, 106037). However, other clinical research shows that taking sesame or sesame oil may modestly reduce body weight when compared with no oil or a control oil (108355, 108357).\nWound-healing effects\nSesame oil is sometimes used topically for burns and wounds. In an animal model, a combination of sesame seeds and sesame oil reduced the time to skin epithelization and wound contraction (28258)."

Sessile oak wood also contains triterpene saponins and their glycosides (93297, 93414). Oligomeric proanthocyanidins include mainly catechin, epicatechin, and gallocatechin (93418). In the human diet, constituents of sessile oak can be obtained by consuming wines and spirits stored in sessile oak barrels (93412, 93415, 93417).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is some preliminary laboratory evidence suggesting that sessile bark extract might inhibit the growth of some types of cancer cells, such as colon, prostate, and glioblastoma (93416).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nEarly research suggests that constituent proteins in shark cartilage are absorbed from the intestinal tract (74710).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nShark cartilage forms the skeleton of sharks and also provides support for structures such as the fins. It is made up of about 40% proteins, 5% to 20% glycosaminoglycans, and up to 25% calcium salts. Chondroitin, a glycosaminoglycan in cartilage, might be an active constituent (6714, 74654, 74658). Shark cartilage is also a rich source of trace elements and minerals such as iron, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, and strontium (74683, 74697).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that shark cartilage might have analgesic activity (6724, 6725). The effect appears to be nitric oxide (NO)-dependent and does not seem to involve the opioid system or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (6724).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that AE-941 (Neovastat), an extract of shark cartilage, reduces airway inflammation by reducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) in lung tissue (74699). Other evidence from animal research suggests that AE-941 can reduce contact hypersensitivity, a form of inflammation. This effect was attributed to the antiangiogenic effects of AE-941 (74742). Also, some in vitro research shows that shark cartilage inhibits interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis (74696). However, some in vitro research shows that shark cartilage extract can increase the production of Th1 inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-gamma (74692, 93050).\nAnti-psoriasis effects\nThe pathogenesis of psoriasis includes increased stimulation of angiogenesis (4893). Preliminary clinical evidence shows that oral and topical shark cartilage inhibits local angiogenic activity and may therefore have anti-psoriatic effects (4893, 6709).\nAnticancer effects\nThe use of shark cartilage attracted popular attention after some publications suggested that sharks don't get cancer and implied that shark cartilage could prevent cancer in humans (2014, 6722). Since then, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and cartilage tumors have been identified in sharks (6714). Also, research in humans has failed to show benefit in advanced, previously-treated cancers (2015, 6716, 6717, 13086, 17102, 74731).\n\nAnimal research shows that shark cartilage has activity against several mouse tumor lines, including lung carcinoma and brain tumors (6726, 74656, 74662, 74665, 74710, 74721, 74733, 74735, 74736). Shark cartilage also seems to inhibit angiogenesis and prevent new blood vessel growth required for solid tumor proliferation (2013, 74660, 74661, 74663, 74664, 74665, 74689, 74707, 74708, 74711, 74734).\n\nAE-941 (Neovastat) is an extract of shark cartilage that has been extensively studied. It is made up of a mixture of proteins with a molecular weight less than 500 kilodaltons. AE-941 inhibits angiogenesis, which is increased in highly vascularized cancers. As an antiangiogenic agent, it interferes with binding of cytokines and other enzymes at their receptor sites. AE-941 competes for binding sites with fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other cytokines (74664, 74710). It also inhibits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), an enzyme that facilitates angiogenesis (10397, 10398, 17102). In addition, AE-941 induces apoptosis of endothelial cells involved with growth of blood vessels. This action is mediated by activation of caspases, which are key mediators of programmed cell death in many types of cells. AE-941 appears to activate caspase-1 and caspase-2 that are specific mediators of apoptosis in blood vessel endothelial cells (10396).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests that shark cartilage and a preparation containing shark cartilage can act as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species and prevent DNA damage (6723, 74715).\nFibrinolytic effects\nIn vitro research shows that shark cartilage extract can degrade fibrin gel in an aprotinin-insensitive manner, suggesting fibrinolytic effects (74681). Theoretically, this may benefit people with vaso-occlusive or thromboembolic disorders.\nImmune stimulation\nIn vitro research shows that protein derived from shark cartilage increases natural killer (NK) cell activity, suggesting immunostimulant activity (74700)."

These compounds may be incorporated into membrane phospholipids, possibly altering lipid signaling in the cell. Examples include 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 16:1 n-7, and 18:1 n-9 alkylglycerols. The 18:1 n-9 variety comprises up to 68% of the total alkylglycerols (94284). Shark liver oil is classified as a topical protectant (2551).\nAnticancer effects\nShark liver oil has been shown to reduce tumor growth in animal research. This effect is attributed to antiangiogenic properties of the alkylglycerol constituents of shark liver oil (94284). Shark liver oil has been shown in animals to have antiangiogenic properties in certain cancers, including cutaneous lesions, kidney cancer, and urinary bladder cancer including L-1 syngeneic (2549). The monounsaturated alkylglycerols seem to have the greatest antiangiogenic effect (94284). However, other findings are contradictory (2552).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is some interest in using shark liver oil for cardiovascular disease. In human research, shark liver oil appeared to prevent a slowing of blood flow thought to be associated with a reduction in external temperature. However, shark liver oil did not appear to improve vascular stiffness (94286). Another small clinical study shows that shark liver oil decreases the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in erythrocytes and improves membrane fluidity, both of which have been associated with improved cardiovascular health (111110).\nImmune effects\nAlkylglycerols in shark liver oil may have hematopoietic effects (94284). They appear to increase leukocyte and thrombocyte counts within specific dose ranges (2552). In animal research, shark liver oil amplified vaccination-induced increases in immunoglobulins (94284). In human research, shark liver oil modified the activity of white blood cells and the levels of mediators such as cytokines (94284).\nMale fertility effects\nAnimal research suggests that taking shark liver oil might improve sperm motility due to increased levels of alkylglycerols in the membrane. It is possible that the increased availability of alkylglycerols in the membrane acts as a precursor to compounds involved in sperm function (94284).\nRadioprotective effects\nAlkoxyglycerols derived from shark liver oil may decrease irradiation damage in patients undergoing treatment for uterine cancer (2552). It is thought that the radioprotective properties of alkoxyglycerols may stem from its incorporation into a pool of platelet-activating factors, resulting in biosynthesis (2550)."

Animal research shows that, when applied to the skin of mice with chemically-induced inflammation, these triterpene esters suppress levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by reducing cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (29980). Theoretically, this might reduce the severity of skin disorders associated with inflammation, such as eczema. Preliminary clinical research shows that application of shea butter to skin with moderate eczema reduces disease severity and improves skin smoothness (29979, 98620).\nLipid lowering effects\nIn human research, shea butter reduced plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A-I (14087). Also, shea butter or a shea butter sunflower blend have been shown to reduce postprandial lipemia in humans (28338, 28339)."

Large pieces that have been inadequately chewed can cause intestinal blockage, occasionally requiring surgery.\nDermatologic\nOrally, shiitake mushrooms can cause shiitake dermatitis, a skin eruption that resembles whiplash marks, usually found on the trunk and limbs. This dermatitis is thought to be a toxic response to lentinan or other compounds found normally in uncooked or inadequately cooked shiitake mushroom. The rash can be made worse by scratching. Symptom onset is usually within hours to days and can persist for 3-4 weeks before resolving on its own. There is some evidence that treatment with steroids alone or with antihistamines might reduce the duration of the rash by a small amount in some people (1148, 1152, 74782, 74806, 94236, 94237, 94238, 94240, 94241, 94243) (94244, 94246, 94247, 94248, 94249, 94252, 94253, 94254, 94255, 94256)(94257, 94259, 94261, 94262, 108302, 111909, 111912, 111913). The dermatitis may include small purple spots from broken capillaries, skin plaques, burning, blanching, and pustules (94256, 108302). Rarely the rash may look like measles rather than whiplash (94256). Histologically, there may be evidence of dermal and epidermal edema, lymphocyte infiltration, and skin thickening (94256, 94257). Other symptoms associated with the dermatitis include fever, aching, malaise, eosinophilia, diarrhea, prickling in the hands, trouble swallowing, conjunctivitis, and pustules with small ulcers in the mouth (94240, 94246, 94247, 94249, 94256, 94257, 108302). It is likely that the dermatitis and other symptoms are due to a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (94244, 94255). Cooking shiitake mushroom generally prevents shiitake dermatitis, although some cases have occurred in people who have consumed cooked sources (94242, 94244). It appears that to inactivate lentinan, cooking temperatures of at least 130°C are needed (94243).\n\nLess common is a photosensitivity reaction associated with oral ingestion, which involves rash and pruritus after sun exposure (1148, 94241).\n\nOrally, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC has been reported to cause mild itching (30375).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, shiitake mushrooms can cause abdominal discomfort, including bloating, nausea, pain, vomiting, and diarrhea (1149, 30365, 30375, 30419, 94241). Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, problems swallowing, or mouth ulcers have been associated with shiitake dermatitis (94241, 94256). Consumption of large pieces of shiitake mushroom with inadequate chewing can cause abdominal obstruction that has resulted in death in one case and surgical intervention in two others.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of shiitake is the entire mushroom. Shiitake mushroom contains very low concentrations of lentinan (0.02%) (6). It also contains the bioactive compound eritadenine, tocopherols and phenolic compounds, including p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, and vanillic acids (74808, 103159). Shiitake mushroom is a food source of proteins, fatty acids (linoleic, palmitic and oleic acids), carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals (74783, 74877, 103159, 111911). It also contains large amounts of dietary fiber, of which 83% is insoluble (103160). Shiitake mushroom extracts such as AHCC are composed mainly of oligosaccharides, 20% of which is of the alpha-1,4-glucantype (13093, 30377, 30371, 30413, 30414, 30380). Other known constituents include beta-glucans, activated hemicellulose (30396), glycoproteins, amino acids, lipids, and minerals (30349, 30373, 30358, 30396).\nAnti-hyperuricemic effects\nIn animal research, a polysaccharide-protein complex isolated from shiitake mushroom reduces serum uric acid through modulation of the gut-kidney axis. The isolate appears to work through multiple mechanisms, including regulating uric acid transporters, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and modifying gut microbiota composition (116219).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn rats with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, pretreatment with the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC was shown to attenuate colonic inflammation, as evidenced in part by improvements in damage score, necrosis, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (30362). The anti-inflammatory effects of AHCC were comparable to those of sulfasalazine (a known anti-inflammatory agent) (30362), and additive when given in combination with Bifidobacterium longum (BB536), a known gut prebiotic (30431, 30380). The protection of endothelial cell barrier function has been implicated as a possible mechanism of action behind the anti-inflammatory effects of AHCC, which is due in part to AHCC's purported antioxidant capacity (30457). In cells and animals exposed to Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza virus A1PRl8/34 (PR8), AHCC has also been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects via a reduction in IFN-al AS RNA/mRNA levels (30387).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using shiitake mushroom, especially the extract AHCC, for the treatment of many cancers, such as prostate cancer. Shiitake mushroom contains very low concentrations of lentinan (0.02%), which has antitumor effects (6). The antineoplastic effects of shiitake mushroom might be related to its immunostimulatory effects (74803, 74866).\n\nHowever, preliminary clinical research shows that taking AHCC 4.5 grams daily for 6 months does not significantly reduce prostate-specific antigen levels when compared with baseline in people diagnosed with prostate cancer (30375). AHCC is thought to act as a biological response modifier. AHCC seems to have antioxidant effects. It also seems to increase activity of natural killer (NK) cells in patients with cancer (13093). Antitumor effects have been observed in preclinical and clinical research with various types of cancer following the administration of AHCC alone (30364, 30406, 30407, 30418) or in combination with known anticancer agents such as cisplatin and sorafenib (30395, 30415, 30430, 30433). Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, purported antitumor processes have included cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, immunomodulation, altered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and increased properdin activity (30445, 30446, 30410, 30429, 30420, 30385, 30447). In vitro, AHCC has also demonstrated antimetastatic effects, likely due in part to its ability to attenuate the attachment of invasive cancer cells to endothelial cells (30448).\n\nCompared to monotherapy, a synergistic antitumor effect has been observed in preclinical research when AHCC was coadministered with genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP) (30434, 30435) and liposomal doxorubicin (30429, 30420).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a rat model of gestational diabetes, administration of a shiitake mushroom extract improved maternal glucose tolerance and increased insulin levels, but did not reduce hyperglycemia (103159). The extract AHCC has been shown to prevent the onset of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in animals (30408) and mitigate the impairments in endothelial barrier function which occur in diabetes (30390).\nAntifungal effects\nIn animals, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC has been shown to increase host survival and decrease viable fungal counts of opportunistic infections by Candida albicans (30367). Similar effects have been seen following the coadministration of AHCC and UREX (a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) in an animal model of Candida vaginitis (30386).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nIn animal research, shiitake mushroom reduces plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids (1155). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, potential active constituents include eritadenine, which has shown cholesterol-lowering effects in animal research (74846). In hypercholesterolemic prostate cancer patients, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC combined with genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP) decreased serum cholesterol levels (30397).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that shiitake mushroom extract inhibits the growth of various types of bacteria and fungi (74774, 74789, 74800). However, use of a mouth rinse containing shiitake mushroom extract does not seem to prevent the growth of bacteria commonly found in the mouth (94250).\nAntioxidant effects\nShiitake mushroom is reported to have antioxidant activity. In human research, shiitake mushroom increased levels of reduced glutathione (108300). In a rat model of gestational diabetes, antioxidant activity of shiitake mushroom was reported to protect the fetus from damage caused by hyperglycemia (103159). The extract AHCC may act as a potent antioxidant, and as such, may possibly protect against disorders induced by oxidative stress. In animal studies, AHCC has been observed to suppress oxidative stress and the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (13093). In animal models of ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA)-induced oxidative stress, AHCC normalized serum hormone levels and hepatic oxidative status (30356, 30388). Laboratory research has suggested that AHCC also inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at the level of transcription, causing a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) production in hepatocytes (30364). It has been suggested that AHCC seems to decrease the levels of iNOS mRNA by reducing mRNA stabilization rather than inhibiting its synthesis.\nAntiviral effects\nIn animals, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC has demonstrated various antiviral effects, including increased host survival, decreased infection severity, and shortened recovery time against influenza A (H1N1, PR8) (30360, 30367, 30372), bird flu (H5N1) (30392, 30393), West Nile viral infection (30371), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) (116218). AHCC has also selectively reduced hepatitis C viral RNA in hepatitis patients with genotype 3 (30419) and reduced hepatitis B antigen levels when administered in combination with known antiviral agents, such as entecavir, tenofovir, or lamivudine (30438). Preliminary evidence in adult females suggests that AHCC may have activity against human papillomavirus (HPV) (110129).\n\nImmune system induction, as demonstrated by increased activity of NK cells, increased infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, and enhancement of T cell immune responses has been purported as a possible mechanism of action behind AHCC's observed antiviral effects (30360, 30371, 116218). Animal research has suggested that the immune response of AHCC against influenza A acts in a dose-dependent manner (30372). Laboratory research suggests that shiitake mushroom extract has antiviral activity, possibly by inhibiting the initial stages of replication (74834, 74874). The constituent lentinan has been found to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (74786, 74789).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn mice exposed to acute ischemia-reperfusion injury, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC has demonstrated protective effects, as indicated by lower indices of organ, mucosal, and ischemic injury (30400, 30401). In mice with intestinal candidiasis, AHCC activated intestinal mucosal immunity via the stimulation of immunoglobulin A (IgA) production and the proliferation of Peyer's patches (30439).\nHepatic effects\nIn animal models of cancer, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC demonstrated protective effects against 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)-, methotrexate (MTX)-, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury, as evidenced by improved liver hypertrophy and degeneration, normalization of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (sGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (sGPT) enzyme activity, increased enzymatic capacity for drug metabolism in the liver, and decreased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (30373, 30384, 30440).\n\nIn animal models, liver protective effects have also been seen against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury with partial hepatectomy (30441, 116171). In humans with nonviral liver conditions, AHCC improved (decreased) aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) liver function (30427).\n\nAdenosine isolated from AHCC has also been shown to dose-dependently inhibit the production of NO and reduce the expression of iNOS mRNA, via NF-KS- and IL-l RI-dependent pathways (30443). According to other research in animals, AHCC has also been shown to mediate oxidative stress in the liver by upregulating both peroxiredoxin-6 and regucalcin (30389).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn human research, eating shiitake mushrooms increased signs of immune stimulation, including natural killer cell and T cell activity. Based on saliva immunoglobulin levels, gut immunity was enhanced (94245). In animals given shiitake mushroom extract, levels of white blood cells and lymphocytes are increased (111910). Also, a shiitake mushroom polysaccharide extract reduces levels of inflammatory mediators in the colon, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and interferon-gamma (111906). Shiitake mushroom contains lentinan which has known immunostimulatory effects. Lentinan appears to enhance T-helper cells and stimulate interferon and various cytokines. It also increases the activity of natural killer cells and macrophages. In laboratory research these same effects may be seen with shiitake mushroom extracts (74769, 74801, 74822, 74844, 74857, 74864, 74866, 74876).\n\nIt has been suggested that the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC strengthens immunity by increasing NK cell, lymphokine active killer (LAK) cell, T cell, B cell, and cytokine activity (30361, 30368, 30358, 30410, 30367, 30366, 30360, 30371, 30379, 30376)(30411, 30394, 30412, 30413, 30414, 30415, 30416, 30417, 30418, 30381)(30382). Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and neopterin have been shown to be slightly increased in AHCC-treated animals and patients (30359, 30352, 30366, 30460, 30416), although some research has reported a lack of change with respect to cytokine levels (30368). In vitro, AHCC promoted the secretion of IL-8, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in intestinal epithelial cells and monocytes via TLR4/MyD88- and NF-kappaB/MAPK-mediated signal transduction pathways (30381). In humans, significant changes in the levels of albumin and percentage of lymphocytes were observed at one and two months after treatment with AHCC (30353). Moreover, when taken as an adjunct therapy to conventional influenza vaccination, AHCC has also been shown to increase anti-influenza B titers but lacked an effect on anti-influenza A titers compared to baseline (30382). Increased NK cell-binding capacity to tumor cell targets and increased NK cell granularity have been purported as possible AHCC mechanisms of action (30417).\n\nThe immune-bolstering effects of AHCC have also been seen in mice maintained under hind limb-unloading models of spaceflight conditions (30357). According to animal research, AHCC was suggested to modulate immune activity via the suppression of thymic apoptosis (30351).\nRadioprotective effects\nIn mice exposed to gamma-ray radiation, the shiitake mushroom extract AHCC lowered the incidence of congenital malformations and suppressed the incidence of radiation-induced leukemia, compared to untreated controls (30399)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nShilajit is an exudate of animal, microbial, mineral, and plant material found in cracks in high mountain ranges of Asia (112614, 112616, 112617, 112619). Although the exact composition varies with geography and temperature, crude shilajit is mainly comprised of humic substance. It contains vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and amino acids, as well as organic acids, gums, waxes, steroids, and many other compounds. The humic substance in shilajit is mainly the organic acids fulvic acid and humic acid (112625, 112627, 112636). The active ingredients are thought to be the free dibenzo-alpha-pyrones (DBPs), conjugated DBP-chromoproteins, and fulvic acid. These compounds are found in high levels in processed shilajit (112619, 112621).\nAnalgesic effects\nShilajit is traditionally used as an analgesic agent. In an animal diabetes model, shilajit reduces pain associated with extreme heat (112630). The mechanism of action is unclear. The use of intraperitoneal shilajit in animal models of pain has also been investigated with inconsistent findings. In animal models of induced inflammatory pain, providing shilajit intraperitoneally has analgesic effects comparative to diclofenac and morphine (112636). In contrast, in a morphine dependent animal model exposed to pain from heat, intraperitoneal shilajit does not have analgesic effects. However, there was an inhibition of morphine tolerance development (112634).\nAnti-cancer effects\nShilajit is of interest for cancer. In vitro, shilajit has cytotoxic effects against breast and lung cancer cell lines (112630). In an osteosarcoma animal model, shilajit potentiates the prevention of metastasis-induced liver and kidney damage by chemotherapeutics (112628).\nAnti-ulcerogenic effects\nShilajit is of interest for its anti-ulcerogenic effects. In an animal model of aspirin-induced gastric lesions, shilajit modestly reduces the number and size of gastric lesions. The mechanism of actions may be related to a shilajit-induced increase in gastric pH and/or changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (112624).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of shilajit may explain some of its reported clinical effects. In healthy adults, taking shilajit increases levels of superoxide dismutase, as well as levels of vitamin C and E. The antioxidant effects of shilajit are thought to play a role in its purported clinical benefits. Both shilajit, and the constituent fulvic acid, have antioxidant effects in vitro (112619). In postmenopausal adults, shilajit reduces markers of oxidative stress (112613). Antioxidant effects of shilajit have also been found in animal and in vitro studies (112626, 112630, 112631).\nCardioprotective effects\nShilajit is of interest for its cardioprotective effects. In an animal model of myocardial injury, pretreatment with shilajit reduces the severity of cardiac injury. The mechanism of action is unclear but appears to be unrelated to the antioxidant system (112623).\nDermatologic effects\nShilajit is of interest for its anti-aging effects. In adults ages 30-65 years, taking shilajit improves skin perfusion. This improvement may be related to changes in the expression of genes relevant to skin health, including those needed for blood vessel development, endothelial cell migration, and the extracellular matrix. However, there was no effect on skin quality, including skin hydration or elasticity (112615).\nFatigue effects\nShilajit is of interest as an adaptogen for increasing energy. In an animal model of induced chronic fatigue syndrome, a standardized shilajit product reduced immobility, anxiety, and plasma corticosterone levels. Mechanisms of action seem to be related to an improvement in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress and/or a reduction in stress-induced production of corticosterone (112631).\nFertility effects\nShilajit has traditionally been used as an aphrodisiac and to boost fertility. In human males, shilajit increased levels of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but not luteinizing hormone (LH). Also, semen oxidative stress was reduced (112612, 112621). In an animal model of cadmium-induced male infertility, shilajit improves the daily sperm production and testosterone levels by improving testicular function. Sperm motility and fertility were also improved (112625). In another animal model, shilajit increased spermatogenesis (112632). In female animals, shilajit induced ovulation (112632).\nHepatoprotective effects\nShilajit is traditionally used for liver conditions and to prevent metabolic dysfunction. In an animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, shilajit reduces liver enzymes and steatosis. Levels of glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were also improved (112626).\nHypolipidemic effects\nShilajit is of interest for its hypolipidemic effects. Hypolipidemic effects of shilajit have been shown in both animal and human research (112619, 112638). In healthy adults, taking processed shilajit modestly reduces levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and modestly increases levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (112619).\nImmune effects\nShilajit is of interest for the treatment of allergies and various infections. In animal research, shilajit stimulates innate-, cell-, and humoral-mediated immunity, including antibody response, T cell proliferation, phagocytosis, and cytokine production (112635).\nMetabolic effects\nShilajit is of interest for metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In an animal high fat diet-induced fatty liver model, shilajit reduces the changes in blood glucose and insulin resistance (112626, 112627). Animal research also suggests that shilajit improves levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (112626). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, these beneficial effects were associated with improved antioxidant status, increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, and decreases in the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. There were also beneficial changes in levels of the hormones, adiponectin and resistin (112626, 112627).\nMuscular effects\nShilajit is traditionally used as an adaptogen and is of interest for muscular strength and athletic performance. Clinical research shows that taking shilajit prevents a decline in muscle strength after a fatiguing protocol in some, but not, adults (112614). In adults with overweight or obesity, shilajit upregulates extracellular matrix-related genes in the muscle, including collagen, elastin, fibronectin 1, and others. These genes are involved in skeletal muscle adaptation repair and regeneration (112617). Human research also shows that shilajit induces type 1 collagen synthesis, and possibly reduces collagen degradation (112614, 112618). Shilajit also increases levels of testosterone, beneficial for muscular development, in both human and animal research (112612, 112621, 112625).\nNeuroprotective effects\nShilajit is thought to have neuroprotective and adaptogenic effects. In an animal model of alcohol addiction, shilajit reduces alcohol intake and withdrawal anxiety. The mechanism of action may be related to alterations in cortico hippocampal dopamine, but not serotonin or gamma-aminobutyric acid, levels (112629). Shilajit is of interest for the prevention of Alzheimer disease. In patients with Alzheimer disease, research shows that taking shilajit reduces levels of the oligomeric tau marker in the blood (112637).\nSkeletal effects\nShilajit is of interest for increasing bone density. In postmenopausal adults, shilajit modestly increases bone mineral density by reducing bone turnover, oxidative stress, and inflammation (112613). In an animal model of osteoporosis, some shilajit extracts modestly improve serum levels of calcium and phosphorus, as well as osteocalcin and calcitonin, hormones involved in bone turnover. Antioxidant and inflammatory markers were reduced (112633)."

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nSiberian cocklebur is generally regarded as unsafe for use. Any benefits of therapy might not outweigh the risk of toxicity. Orally, Siberian cocklebur seeds and seedlings can cause various adverse effects. Initial effects include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, elevated liver function tests, increased risk of bleeding, drowsiness, dizziness, dyspnea, sweating, fever, and palpitations (27827, 27828, 99948). In some cases, symptoms have progressed to metabolic acidosis, worsening changes in blood sugar, arrhythmia, seizures, convulsions, coma, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, renal failure, myocardial and muscle injury, and death due to multi-organ failure (27827, 27828, 99948). Fatal hepatic failure due to the Siberian cocklebur fruit has also been reported in a 20-month old child (27815).\nCardiovascular\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seed can cause both tachycardia and bradycardia (27828, 99948). Palpitations can occur in as little as 3 hours after ingestion, with arrhythmia occurring a few hours later (27828). Elevated heart enzymes can also occur soon after intake (27828). White blood cell infiltration in the myocardium has been reported in autopsy findings from patients who died after consuming Siberian cocklebur (27828).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause hypoglycemia. This occurs soon after consumption. Later, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and/or worsening hypoglycemia might occur. In some individuals, these changes can cause seizures (27828, 99948).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur within a few hours after consumption (27827, 27828, 99948). In one case, pancreatitis occurred approximately 2 days after intake of the seeds in a 15-year-old girl (99948).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can increase the risk of bleeding, mainly due to hepatotoxic effects (27828).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause liver damage, including increased bilirubin levels and increases in liver enzyme levels by as much as 6 times the normal value. These symptoms can progress to include jaundice, hepatomegaly, and edema, resulting in liver failure and death in some patients (27827, 27828, 99948). In one case, grade 3 encephalopathy and liver failure necessitated a liver transplant in a 15-year-old girl who had consumed approximately 80 Siberian cocklebur seeds (27815, 99948).\n\nThe Siberian cocklebur fruit has also been reported to cause fatal hepatic failure in a 20-month old child who consumed Siberian cocklebur fruit over a 2-month period (27815)\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause rhabdomyolysis (27828). White blood cell infiltration in the muscles has been reported in autopsy findings from patients who died after consuming Siberian cocklebur (27828).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause altered mental status, malaise, dizziness, sweating, fever, seizures, convulsions, unconsciousness, and coma (27827, 27828, 99948). Malaise, dizziness, and sweating onset are rapid (27828). Fever onset is usually after the onset of vomiting (27827). Unconsciousness can follow vomiting within minutes or hours, with coma occurring later in some individuals (27827, 27828). Microvascular hemorrhage in the brain has been reported in autopsy findings for patients who died after consuming Siberian cocklebur (27828).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds can cause dyspnea and irregular breathing. White blood cell infiltration in the lungs has been reported in autopsy findings from patients who died after consuming Siberian cocklebur (27828).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur seedlings and seeds have resulted in cases of renal injury with increased levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. This can result in decreased urine output. In some individuals, renal symptoms return to normal. However, renal failure can occur and renal proximal tubular necrosis has been reported in autopsy findings for patients who died after consuming Siberian cocklebur (27828, 99948).\nless\nOther\nOrally, Siberian cocklebur can cause death associated with multi-organ failure. In some cases, death occurred less than 12 hours following intake. In one outbreak of illness related to consumption of Siberian cocklebur seedlings, death occurred in 25% of those affected. In another group of individuals with Siberian cocklebur seed poisoning, death occurred in three of nine of those affected. Death is more likely to occur in young children, especially those less than 15 years of age (27827, 27828).\n\nThe quantity of Siberian cocklebur associated with death is not clear. In one illness outbreak, deaths were mainly in children and the seedlings were consumed in large quantities due to a food shortage (27827). In another, children died after consuming an unknown quantity of seeds while working on a farm (27828).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Atractyloside, carboxyatractyloside, and 40-desulphate-atractyloside have been identified as toxic principles of Siberian cocklebur, and are concentrated in the seeds and seedlings (27816, 27817, 27826, 27828, 99947). These compounds appear to induce hepatotoxicity in animal and in vitro models by inducing oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial function, and affecting the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids (99947).\n\nIn pigs, feeding seedlings at 0.75% to 3% of body weight, or ground bur at 20% to 30% of feed, caused acute depression, convulsions, and death (27816). In animal research, a water extract of Siberian cocklebur fruit was associated with an 80% death rate at an acute single dose of 400 grams/kg. Lower doses were not associated with deaths, and processing of the fruit reduced the number of deaths by approximately 50% (99945). Acute toxicities were lacking with consumption of Siberian cocklebur fruit at up to ten times what is used in traditional Chinese medicine treatments. However, there was evidence of liver and kidney damage, as well as death, with chronic use for 12 weeks at levels 3 times what is used in traditional treatments (99945).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Siberian cocklebur are the whole plant (99946). The fruit and other aerial parts of Siberian cocklebur contain xanthiazinone, xanthiazone, xanthiside, xanthienopyran, and 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one (27819), various caffeoylquinic acids (27820, 99944), the eremophilanolides siberiolide A and B (27821), neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, and cynarin (27823, 99944). They also contain sesquiterpene lactones including pungiolides A, D, and E, xanthatin and its derivatives, and xanthinosin (27830, 27833). Atractyloside, carboxyatractyloside, and 40-desulphate-atractyloside have been identified as toxic principles in the seeds and seedlings. Mature plants contain much lower levels of these compounds (27816, 27817, 27826, 27828, 99947). Carboxyatractyloside levels can be as high as 600 mg/kg of dried plant material or 400 mg/kg of fresh plant material (27828).\nAntiarthritic effects\nSiberian cocklebur is traditionally used for rheumatoid arthritis. Animal research suggests that an extract of Siberian cocklebur fruit has activity against experimentally-induced rheumatoid arthritis in rats (27829). Siberian cocklebur fruit extract shows anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, possibly explaining this traditional use. The production of inflammatory mediators is inhibited in various in vitro models (27814, 27818, 27822, 99946).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSiberian cocklebur is traditionally used for diabetes. Siberian cocklebur fruit extract and the constituent caffeic acid have shown antidiabetic effects in animal models, with improvements in glucose levels and insulin sensitivity (27824, 27832). In vitro, Siberian cocklebur fruit extract protected against inflammation-induced beta-cell damage (27825). The Siberian cocklebur constituent methyl-3,5-di-caffeoyquinic acid is thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic effects of this plant. This compound inhibits the activities of various enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion and response to insulin. It also inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products (27831, 99944).\nHepatic effects\nSome laboratory research shows that extracts of the fruit or aerial parts of Siberian cocklebur have hepatoprotective effects, decreasing lipogenesis and reducing inflammation (27824, 99946). However, Siberian cocklebur seeds and seedlings contain hepatotoxic compounds, including atractyloside, carboxyatractyloside, and 40-desulphate-atractyloside. These compounds appear to induce hepatotoxicity in animal and in vitro models by inducing oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial function, and affecting the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids (99947). Hepatotoxicity and liver failure have occurred with the consumption of Siberian cocklebur seeds in humans (27827, 27828, 99948)."

These include anorexia, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, difficulty urinating, dizziness, dry mouth, flushing, headache, hypertension, hyperthermia, increased thirst, insomnia, irritability, myocardial infarction, nausea, palpitations, personality changes, psychosis, restlessness, rhabdomyolysis, stroke, tachycardia, and vomiting (1270, 1276, 3719, 6008, 6486, 6998, 8647, 10004, 10382, 10689).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with Sida cordifolia.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Sida cordifolia.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Sida cordifolia are the root, leaves, and seeds. Sida cordifolia contains the alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenethylamine, vasicinone, vasicine, vascinol, and others. Other components of Sida cordifolia include flavonoids, ecdysteroids, saponins, aliphatics, betaine, and choline. The leaves and stems of Sida cordifolia contain higher concentrations of ephedrine as compared to the roots (93694).\nAdaptogenic activity\nAnimal research suggests that Sida cordifolia root extracts have adaptogenic and anti-stress activity (93692).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that Sida cordifolia extracts have analgesic activity (4299, 12906, 33521, 93691, 93693, 93694), with some research showing similar analgesic activity to diclofenac (93691). The analgesic effects may result from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition (4299, 12906).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that Sida cordifolia extracts exert anti-inflammatory effects (4299, 12906, 33521, 93694). In one study, the ethyl acetate extract of Sida cordifolia root demonstrated comparable anti-inflammatory activity to indomethacin. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects appear to result from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition (4299, 12906).\nAnti-ulcerogenic effects\nSome animal research suggests that the methanolic extract of Sida cordifolia aerial parts has anti-ulcerogenic effects (33522).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSida cordifolia might have antibacterial and antifungal activity. Sida cordifolia extracts have demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity in vitro against Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Staphylococcus aureus, and Xanthonomonas axonopoelies. Some in vitro research shows that extracts of Sida cordifolia have antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Candida strains, and Cryptococcus neoformans (93694).\nAntioxidants effects\nIn vitro research suggests that Sida cordifolia extracts have antioxidant effects (33525, 93691, 93694), but to a much lesser degree than ascorbic acid (93391).\nAntipyretic effects\nSome animal research suggests that the methanolic extract of Sida cordifolia aerial parts has antipyretic effects (33522).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome animal research shows that the aqueous fraction of the hydroalcoholic extract of the leaves of Sida cordifolia produces hypotension through direct stimulation of the endothelial vascular muscarinic receptor. It also produces bradycardia, mainly due to indirect cardiac muscarinic activation (33517). Additional animal research shows that the aqueous fraction of the hydroalcoholic extract of Sida cordifolia leaves induces vasorelaxation (33519).\n\nBecause Sida cordifolia contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, the opposite cardiovascular effects might also be seen. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are both non-selective alpha- and beta-receptor agonists. The ephedrine and pseudoephedrine constituents can directly and indirectly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (12813). Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility, and cause peripheral vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and central nervous system stimulation (8644).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nSome animal research suggests that Sida cordifolia may have CNS depressant effects (33515). Further research in this area is needed, as Sida cordifolia is most often believed to have stimulant, not depressant, effects.\nCytotoxic effects\nSome in vitro research shows that a methanol extract of Sida cordifolia exhibited cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cells (93694).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome animal research shows that an aqueous extract of Sida cordifolia leaves can stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats (33520).\nHypoglycemic effects\nSome animal research suggests that Sida cordifolia methanol and ethanol extracts have hypoglycemic activity (4299, 93694). The clinical significance of this is unknown.\nWeight loss effects\nSome animal research suggests that an aqueous extract of Sida cordifolia may be effective in reducing food intake and body weight (33524). This effect may be partly due to the ephedrine content of Sida cordifolia. Ephedrine is thought to stimulate thermogenesis and contribute to modest short-term weight loss, possibly by increasing norepinephrine release. Aspirin and caffeine might act synergistically with ephedrine by inhibiting prostaglandin, which also increases norepinephrine release (314, 729, 10003)."

However, fewer than 30 cases associated with antacids containing silicates have been reported, despite these products being commercially available since the 1930s. Although exceptionally rare, silicon dioxide kidney stones can also occur without magnesium trisilicate ingestion (11556). Their formation is caused by an acidic urinary pH. In at least one case, urine alkalinization resulted in resolution of the symptoms (75075).\n\nCase-control studies have shown that occupational exposure to silicon dioxide is related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis (75114).

Patients with occupational pulmonary silicosis may develop microscopic polyangiitis (inflammation of the blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, throat, lungs, and kidneys, also known as Wegener's granulomatosis). Meta-analyses suggest that occupational exposure to silicon dioxide increases the risk of lung cancer (75085, 75095, 75115).

This could reduce the risk of osteoporosis (10470, 12425). However, it is unclear if silicon supplements can reduce the risk for osteoporosis.\n\nSilicon intake has also been evaluated in postmenopausal females. Clinical and population-based research suggests that higher silicon intake does not seem to benefit postmenopausal females in general, although it may benefit those on hormone replacement therapy (10470, 12425, 75118, 92135). Bone loss in postmenopausal females is primarily due to bone resorption. Silicon seems to affect only bone formation (12425).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral silicon is beneficial in patients with aging skin.\nA small preliminary clinical study in healthy volunteers aged 40-60 years shows that taking a specific product (Exsynutriment by Biotec) containing organic silicon 600 mg in hydrolyzed marine collagen once daily, 15 minutes before breakfast, for 90 days improves skin firmness, hydration, and texture, but not wrinkles, brightness, or softness, when compared with placebo (100837).\nless\nAlzheimer disease.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with silicon.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSilicon is rapidly absorbed in the proximal small intestine (75074, 75089, 92135, 92136). Some absorption may also occur in the stomach; after total gastrectomy, plasma silicon levels can be reduced by as much as 26% (92134).\n\nThe absorption of silicon depends on the total amount present, as well as the forms in which it is present (75096, 92136). The readily available and absorbable form of silicon is the oxidized form, silicic acid [Si(OH)4, monomeric silicic acid, monosilicic acid, orthosilicic acid] which is present in water and other beverages (75089). After oral consumption, silicon is converted to silicic acid, which increases its absorption (10470, 75080, 75096, 92136, 95009). Silicic acid is approximately 50% bioavailable; however, it polymerizes when it is highly concentrated, and the bioavailability decreases to approximately 7% (75074, 92136). Silicon absorption is inversely correlated to the degree of polymerization of silicic acid (75096, 92136). The bioavailability of dietary silicon is about 40% (10470). Silicate additives have low oral bioavailability but are absorbed when solubilized to silicic acid (75089). Typically, the maximum serum concentration of silicon is reached 1-2 hours after ingestion (92136).\nDistribution\nThe human body contains 1-2 grams of silicon (75089). Silicic acid equilibrates freely across biological membranes, resulting in relatively constant intracellular concentrations of silicon (75097). In humans, most of the silicon is contained in connective tissues such as the aorta, trachea, bone, tendons, and skin (7135, 12425). Silicon is also found in breast milk (75092).\nMetabolism\nPreliminary research suggests that the pathways of silicon and iron metabolism may be directly linked (75093).\nExcretion\nAbout 70-80% of ingested silicon is excreted via the kidneys by glomerular filtration into the urine (110029). The majority is excreted in less than eight hours following ingestion (10470, 75074, 75089, 92135, 92136). Elimination of silicon involves two first-order processes with half-lives of about 3 hours and 11 hours, and total outputs of 90% and 10%, respectively (75116, 110029). Renal clearance occurs at a rate of 82-96 mL/minute, but is reduced in people with kidney failure (7135, 75074).\n\nFecal excretion of silicon may also occur and has been reported to be as high as 40% (92136).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSilicon is a nonmetallic element which binds with high affinity to oxygen and may occur as crystalline or amorphous silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2), silicic acid (orthosilicic acid, monomeric silicic acid, monosilicic acid, Si(OH)4), and as silicates, such as quartz, which consist of silicon and oxygen bound to other elements. Chemical and biological weathering solubilizes silicon and makes it available as silicic acid (75101). Silicon is a trace mineral obtained from the diet, with a typical daily intake of 14-21 mg (7135, 11556, 12425, 75089, 92135, 95009).\nAluminum binding effects\nAnimal research suggests that silicon supplementation may sequester aluminum and prevent accumulation in tissues (75079, 75101, 75104). Administering aluminum and silicon in the drinking water of rats for five weeks lowers aluminum concentrations in the urine, brain, liver, bone, spleen, and kidneys, when compared with giving aluminum alone (75117). Also, silicon present in beer may reduce deposition of aluminum in the brain by forming nontoxic aluminosilicates (75101). However, other animal research has shown no protective effect of silicon on aluminum toxicity (75112).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using silicon for bone development and maintenance. In animal research, a diet deficient in silicon leads to gross structural abnormalities in the skull, long bones, and cartilage (75107, 75108). Human research has shown that increased dietary intake of silicon is associated with increased bone mineral density in males and premenopausal females. In postmenopausal females taking hormone replacement therapy, it may also be beneficial (10470, 12425, 75089, 75118, 92135). Preclinical research suggests that silicon supplementation might inhibit bone resorption and stimulate bone formation in laboratory models of estrogen deficiency (4988).\n\nOther human studies have demonstrated an association between silicon intake and trabecular bone volume and bone mineral density (BMD) in osteoporotic subjects, and between markers of bone formation and BMD in females with low bone mass (75106, 75110, 75119). Silicic acid seems to stimulate osteoblasts in humans (12425), and laboratory research suggests that silicon stimulates synthesis of collagen and other molecules associated with extracellular matrix production (75089).\nCollagen synthesis effects\nLaboratory, animal, and human research suggests that silicon is involved in collagen synthesis or stabilization and/or extracellular matrix mineralization (75089, 75106, 75107, 75108, 75110, 75118, 75119).

It is derived from vegetable oils or the oil from pine tree wood pulp. When used in commercial products, sitostanol is made fat-soluble by converting to a sitostanol ester using canola oil (5435, 5430, 5814). Sitostanol is an ingredient in the functional food product Benecol margarine and in some salad dressings. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of labeling health claims for foods containing sitostanol-esters and other plant stanol esters for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This ruling is based on the FDA's conclusion that plant stanol esters in conjunction with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol might reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels (6668). However, while there is plenty of evidence that sitostanol lowers cholesterol levels, so far there is no proof that long-term use actually lowers the risk of developing CHD.",

            "Effectiveness": "LIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHypercholesterolemia. Taking sitostanol orally is likely effective for reducing total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in adults with hypercholesterolemia (1886, 3888, 5336, 5429, 5430, 5431, 5432, 5433, 5434, 5435)(5437, 5438, 5439, 5441, 7103, 112081). Sitostanol also seems to be effective for reducing cholesterol levels in healthy children (7193, 7194). However, treating children is not recommended unless LDL levels are greater than 190 mg/dL or greater that 160 mg/dL in the presence of other coronary risk factors. Sitostanol is usually taken as a component of a sitostanol-enriched food such as margarine. It is effective in about 88% of patients when used alone or in combination with a low-fat diet or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") for reducing total and LDL cholesterol (3888, 5431, 5433, 5435, 5437, 5814, 7195). Taking sitostanol 1.8-4 grams daily can reduce total cholesterol levels by 6% to 13% and LDL cholesterol levels by 6% to 20% (5431, 5432, 5433, 5439, 5441, 90731). When added to a statin such as pravastatin (Pravachol) or simvastatin (Zocor), sitostanol reduces total cholesterol by an additional 3% to 11% and LDL cholesterol by another 7% to 16% (5431, 5433). Analyses of clinical research show that sitostanol reduces cholesterol levels as effectively as or better than plant sterols (90730, 90744).\nMost research shows that peak cholesterol lowering effects of sitostanol occur at about 2-3 grams daily, with higher doses not offering any additional benefit (5814, 6185, 7195, 14298, 14814, 90748). However, some clinical research shows that taking sitostanol-rich plant stanols 3-9 grams daily induces a dose-dependent decrease in LDL cholesterol in patients not taking cholesterol-lowering medication (90725). But there is some concern that such high doses of sitostanol might not be safe long-term (90729). Treatment with sitostanol for 2-3 weeks is usually necessary before cholesterol levels decrease significantly. If sitostanol is discontinued, cholesterol levels tend to rise within 2-3 weeks (7105).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Taking sitostanol orally in three divided doses daily reduces total cholesterol by 11% to 14% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15% to 33% in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (3888, 3889, 5438). Sitostanol also seems to improve cholesterol levels in adults with familial hypercholesterolemia who are already being treated with statins. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking sitostanol about 2 grams in three divided doses daily for 6 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 14% and LDL cholesterol by 20% compared to baseline in adults with familial hypercholesterolemia who are already taking simvastatin 20-40 mg daily (3888). Sitostanol does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels in children or adults with familial hypercholesterolemia (3888, 5438, 90743).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer.

Single daily doses seem to be as effective as divided doses administered twice or three times daily (7195).\nChildren\nOral:\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia: Sitostanol 1.5-6 grams taken in three divided doses daily has been used (3888, 3889, 5438).\n\nHypercholesterolemia: Sitostanol 1.5 grams daily for 3 months has been used in 6-year-old children (7194).\nStandardization & Formulation\nSitostanol is usually taken as a component of a sitostanol-enriched food, including margarine spreads (Benecol Light, McNeil Nutritionals) and cereal bars (Benecol, McNeil Nutritionals) (5430, 5439, 90726). In some cases, sitostanol is included in these products as the only plant stanol (3888), while in other cases sitostanol is taken as a plant stanol mixture consisting of sitostanol and campestanol in a 9:1 to 5:1 ratio (5430, 90725).",

Sitostanol lowers blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is a major carrier of fat-soluble antioxidants (7103, 7104, 7105). When corrected for lower LDL levels, the reduction in beta-carotene levels does not seem to be clinically significant (7103, 7104, 7105). Supplementation with beta-carotene is probably not necessary. Suggest that concerned patients increase dietary consumption of beta-carotene-rich vegetables (7104).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSitostanol is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (5435, 5439, 5814, 7196).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSitostanol is a saturated form of the plant sterol sitosterol. Structurally it resembles cholesterol. It is prepared commercially from vegetable oils or the oil from pine tree wood pulp and is then made fat-soluble by forming an sitostanol ester derivative using canola oil (5435, 5430, 5814).\nEffects on absorption of fat-soluble nutrients\nThere is some concern that sitostanol might decrease absorption of some nutrients since it decreases fat absorption. Sitostanol does seem to reduce the absorption of dietary beta-carotene. However, when corrected for lower levels of LDL, the major carrier of beta-carotene, the reduction in beta-carotene levels may not be clinically significant (7103, 7104, 7105). Sitostanol does not seem to affect alpha-tocopherol, retinol, vitamin D, or lycopene (5434, 7104, 7105, 90725). Most studies suggest that taking plant stanol-enriched margarine does not reduce blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin (90719, 90725, 90727).\nLipid-lowering effects\nSitostanol competitively inhibits both dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption by competing with cholesterol for the limited space in mixed micelles (5435, 5439, 5814, 7196). However, sitostanol does not have to be taken with meals to lower cholesterol blood levels. Some researchers think sitostanol remains in the intestinal lumen or in the enterocytes after ingestion. So administration of sitostanol at any time of day seems to be as effective as multiple daily doses with meals (7103). Cholesterol levels decrease within 2 to 3 weeks of initiation of sitostanol, and return to pretreatment levels within 2 to 3 weeks of discontinuation (7105), which also suggests a prolonged effect. Sitostanol may not have the same effect in all people. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that sitostanol might work better in people with apolipoprotein E4 alleles, a genetic predisposition to hypercholesterolemia (7105, 7195). About 12% of patients do not respond to sitostanol. In certain patients, hepatic cholesterol synthesis might increase in response to decreased availability of cholesterol, resulting in no change in cholesterol levels (5430). Do not confuse sitostanol with beta-sitosterol, an unsaturated plant sterol in the cholesterol-lowering margarine Take Control (5443). Both sitostanol and beta-sitosterol are used to lower cholesterol levels in people with hypercholesterolemia and appear to be equally effective (7196)."

According to animal research, skullcap contains a flavonoid, baicalin, which is reported to bind to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor (74008). However, preliminary clinical research on skullcap for anxiety is conflicting (12216, 91690).\nSerotonergic effects\nConstituents of skullcap seem to bind the serotonin receptor, 5-HT7, but it is not known if these constituents have agonist or antagonist activity. Any activity on the 5-HT7 receptor is at least partly due to the presence of the flavonoids scutellarin and ikonnikoside I (12104). Activity at the 5-HT7 receptor may contribute to skullcap's purported sedative effects."

It increases the total antioxidant capacity, and decreases total oxidative status and levels of malondialdehyde (112772).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, smartweed extract given orally at doses of 100-200 mg/kg daily for 5 days protects against gastric mucosal injury induced by absolute ethanol. It also protects human gastric epithelial cells against alcohol-induced damage in vitro. The gastric protective effects in animals appear to be due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Smartweed increases the activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione, and decreases malondialdehyde levels in gastric tissue. It also reduces generation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1-beta, by downregulating expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (112771)."

Intravenous sodium chloride is commonly used for various indications (26226, 26227, 29404); however, the use of intravenous sodium chloride within commonly prescribed dosages is not within the scope of this topic.",

Tell patients to avoid exceeding the CDRR intake level of 2.3 grams daily (100310). Higher intake can cause hypertension and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (26229, 98176, 98177, 98178, 98181, 98183, 98184, 100310, 109395, 109396, 109398, 109399).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of sodium when used topically.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (26229, 100310).

Also, both the highest and the lowest pre-pregnancy sodium quintile intakes are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and the delivery of small for gestational age (SGA) infants when compared to the middle intake quintile (106264).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, sodium is well tolerated when used in moderation at intakes up to the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) intake level. Topically, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Worsened cardiovascular disease, hypertension, kidney disease.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, intake of sodium above the CDRR intake level can exacerbate hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) (26229, 98176, 100310, 106263). A meta-analysis of observational research has found a linear association between increased sodium intake and increased hypertension risk (109398). Observational research has also found an association between increased sodium salt intake and increased risk of CVD, mortality, and cardiovascular mortality (98177, 98178, 98181, 98183, 98184, 109395, 109396, 109399). However, the existing research is unable to confirm a causal relationship between sodium intake and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; high-quality, prospective research is needed to clarify this relationship (100312). As there is no known benefit with increased salt intake that would outweigh the potential increased risk of CVD, advise patients to limit salt intake to no more than the CDRR intake level (100310).\n\nA reduction in sodium intake can lower systolic blood pressure by a small amount in most individuals, and diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension (100310, 100311, 106261). However, post hoc analysis of a small crossover clinical study in White patients suggests that 24-hour blood pressure variability is not affected by high-salt intake compared with low-salt intake (112910). Additionally, the available research is insufficient to confirm that a further reduction in sodium intake below the CDRR intake level will lower the risk for chronic disease (100310, 100311). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that reducing sodium intake increases levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, by a small amount (106261).\n\nIt is unclear whether there are safety concerns when sodium is consumed in amounts lower than the adequate intake (AI) levels. Some observational research has found that the lowest levels of sodium intake might be associated with increased risk of death and cardiovascular events (98181, 98183). However, this finding has been criticized because some of the studies used inaccurate measures of sodium intake, such as the Kawasaki formula (98177, 98178, 101259). Some observational research has found that sodium intake based on a single 24-hour urinary measurement is inversely correlated with all-cause mortality (106260). The National Academies Consensus Study Report states that there is insufficient evidence from observational studies to conclude that there are harmful effects from low sodium intake (100310).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that higher sodium intake is associated with an average increase in body mass index (BMI) of 1.24 kg/m2 and an approximate 5 cm increase in waist circumference (98182). It has been hypothesized that the increase in BMI is related to an increased thirst, resulting in an increased intake of sugary beverages and/or consumption of foods that are high in salt and also high in fat and energy (98182). One large observational study has found that the highest sodium intake is not associated with overweight or obesity when compared to the lowest intake in adolescents aged 12-19 years when intake of energy and sugar-sweetened beverages are considered (106265). However, in children aged 6-11 years, usual sodium intake is positively associated with increased weight and central obesity independently of the intake of energy and/or sugar-sweetened beverages (106265).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIn one case report, severe gastritis and a deep antral ulcer occurred in a patient who consumed 16 grams of sodium chloride in one sitting (25759). Chronic use of high to moderately high amounts of sodium chloride has been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (29405).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nObservational research has found that low sodium levels can increase the risk for osteoporosis. One study has found that low plasma sodium levels are associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis. Low levels, which are typically caused by certain disease states or chronic medications, are associated with a more than 2-fold increased odds for osteoporosis and bone fractures (101260).\n\nConversely, in healthy males on forced bed rest, a high intake of sodium chloride (7.7 mEq/kg daily) seems to exacerbate disuse-induced bone and muscle loss (25760, 25761).\nless\nOncologic\nPopulation research has found that high or moderately high intake of sodium chloride is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer when compared with low sodium chloride intake (29405). Other population research in patients with gastric cancer has found that a high intake of sodium is associated with an approximate 65% increased risk of gastric cancer mortality when compared with a low intake. When zinc intake is taken into consideration, the increased risk of mortality only occurred in those with low zinc intake, but the risk was increased to approximately 2-fold in this sub-population (109400).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nIn patients with hypertension, population research has found that sodium excretion is modestly and positively associated with having moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea. This association was not found in normotensive patients (106262).\nless\nRenal\nIncreased sodium intake has been associated with impaired kidney function in healthy adults. This effect seems to be independent of blood pressure. Observational research has found that a high salt intake over approximately 5 years is associated with a 29% increased risk of developing impaired kidney function when compared with a lower salt intake. In this study, high salt intake was about 2-fold higher than low salt intake (101261).\nless",

Long-term nebulized hypertonic sodium chloride improves lung function and reduces pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in adults with cystic fibrosis show that, when taken along with a bronchodilator and other standard therapies, nebulized hypertonic sodium chloride in concentrations of 3% to 7%, up to 10 mL twice daily for 4 weeks, increases forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) when compared with isotonic saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) (26230, 26230). This benefit was not seen at 48 weeks. Other clinical research in adults with cystic fibrosis shows that inhaling sodium chloride 7%, 4 mL twice daily for 48 weeks, does not improve FEV1 when compared with isotonic saline. However, chronic treatment with hypertonic saline does reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations and increase the number of patients without pulmonary exacerbations when compared with isotonic saline (29402). It is not clear if this benefit occurs in children with cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe Pulmonary Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends that individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 6 years or older use nebulized hypertonic saline long-term to improve lung function, reduce the number of exacerbations, and improve quality of life (29403).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAmphotericin B nephrotoxicity.

A small, open-label clinical study in newborns less than 35 weeks gestation shows that high sodium intake, defined as an average of 0.25% sodium in maintenance fluids, for 48 hours on day 2 and 3 after birth results in less weight loss within the first 72 hours of life when compared with control, but does not improve mortality, length of hospital stay, or complications from prematurity (112908). However, interpretation of these findings is limited by varied concentrations of sodium as an intervention.\nless\nCongestive heart failure. It is unclear if oral sodium is beneficial in patients with acute decompensated heart failure requiring decongestive therapy with diuretics.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure requiring high-dose intravenous furosemide shows that taking sodium chloride 2 grams three times daily for up to 96 hours does not affect patient weight or serum creatinine levels when compared with placebo (112911).

There is also some concern regarding the consumption of too little sodium. Some observational research suggests that the lowest levels of sodium intake might be associated with increased risk of death and cardiovascular events (98181, 98183). However, this research is limited by uncontrolled confounding variables and inaccurate measures of sodium intake (98177, 98178, 101259).

These compartments include plasma (sodium concentration 140 mmol/L), interstitial fluid (sodium concentration 145 mmol/L), and plasma water (sodium concentration 150 mmol/L), as well as tissues such as muscle (sodium concentration about 3 mmol/L). Maintaining appropriate levels of sodium throughout the body involves various systems and hormones, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, the atrial natriuretic peptide, and the sympathetic nervous system. These systems and hormones are able to influence the excretion or retention of sodium (26229).\nExcretion\nIn patients with a sodium and fluid balance at \"steady state\", sodium excretion in the urine is equal to sodium intake (26229). Sodium can also be excreted in sweat. The amount of sodium lost in sweat varies depending on the rate of sweating, the individual's acclimation to heat, and total sodium intake (26229).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe most common dietary form of sodium is sodium chloride (26229). Other dietary sodium salts include acetate, bicarbonate (baking soda), citrate, lactate, phosphate, and benzoate (26229).\nCardiovascular effects\nHigh intake of sodium chloride results in greater amounts of sodium in the body, which leads to water retention and subsequent increases in blood pressure. High sodium intake can worsen hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (26222, 26229, 98181, 109398).\nFluid and electrolyte balance effects\nSodium, the principle cation found in extracellular fluid, plays a large role in regulating the fluid and electrolyte balance of the body (26224, 26229). Fluid movement in the body follows electrolytes such as sodium, whose movement in and out of cells is regulated by the sodium-potassium pump (26229).\nGastrointestinal effects\nHigh intake of sodium chloride can reduce the viability of gastric epithelial cells and increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Acute effects of high doses of sodium chloride may include severe gastritis and deep antral ulcer (25759). Chronic use of high to moderately high amounts of sodium chloride has been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (29405).\nInflammatory effects\nIncreased dietary sodium is thought to induce inflammation, possibly contributing to autoimmune disease onset. Observational research in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus has found that an intake of sodium above 2,000 mg daily is associated with an increased risk of having high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as well as levels of anti-double stranded DNA and complement C4, markers of autoimmune disease (109397).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nSodium is required by the body for muscle function (26229, 90839).\nNeurological effects\nSodium is required by the body for nerve function (26229, 90839).\nRespiratory effects\nSodium chloride solution such as hypertonic saline can increase sputum clearance by breaking ionic bonds within mucus gel, which lowers the stretchiness and thickness of mucus gel. This reduces the size of mucin, a macromolecule in mucus, and promotes the flow of water into mucus layers, improving mucus flow and clearance (26230)."

            "Overview": "Sodium bicarbonate is a salt that dissociates in aqueous solution to form sodium and bicarbonate ions. This dissociation affords a solution that is alkaline. Because of its alkalinity, sodium bicarbonate is often used as a treatment for disorders in which body fluids, such as the blood, urine, or gastric contents become too acidic (29411).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Over-the-counter antacid products containing sodium bicarbonate are considered safe and effective by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when taken for up to 2 weeks at a maximum daily dosage of 200 mEq sodium and 200 mEq bicarbonate by patients up to 60 years old and when taken at a maximum daily dosage of 100 mEq sodium and 100 mEq bicarbonate by patients over 60 years old (90912). Lower doses of sodium bicarbonate, such as 17.5-35 mEq daily, have been safely used for up to 2 years (104845, 104851). ...when used intravenously and appropriately with proper medical supervision. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions are approved by the US FDA to be used as an electrolyte replenisher and as a systemic alkalinizer (13309). ...when used in oral rinses or dentifrices up to twice daily (97731, 98210).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Over 20 cases of stomach rupture have been reported for patients who used sodium bicarbonate to relieve stomach discomfort after eating large meals (29414, 29415, 29416, 29962, 90913). In some of these cases, it is believed that the patients consumed dry sodium bicarbonate or a sodium bicarbonate suspension rather than a completely dissolved sodium bicarbonate solution. Ingestion of undissolved or partially undissolved sodium bicarbonate is believed to produce excess carbon dioxide and corresponding gastric dilation, leading to stomach rupture (90913). There is also concern that excessive or prolonged use of oral sodium bicarbonate may cause metabolic alkalosis characterized by hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hypernatremia (25733, 29962, 90913).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of sodium bicarbonate when used topically.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used intravenously and appropriately with proper medical supervision. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in infants and children (13309).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used topically. At least two cases of hypernatremia resulting from topical application of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been reported (29962, 90914).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of sodium bicarbonate when used orally; avoid using unless advised by a physician.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally or intravenously during pregnancy. There is concern that sodium bicarbonate may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis or fluid retention when used orally during pregnancy (90915).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of oral or intravenous sodium bicarbonate when used in medicinal amounts during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, sodium bicarbonate is generally well tolerated when used in over-the-counter antacid products. However, it is possibly unsafe when used in excessive amounts. Intravenously, sodium bicarbonate is generally well tolerated when used appropriately with proper medical supervision. Topically, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Metabolic alkalosis and stomach rupture.\n\nIntravenously: Alkalotic tetany, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, sodium bicarbonate has been reported to cause increased blood pressure (109689).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, sodium bicarbonate may cause mild adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbance such as bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (25706, 106250). The severity of these effects appears to increase with dose (104850). When taken in large amounts (300 mg/kg as a single dose, 4 ounces over a 24-hour time period, or 10-12 ounces over 5 days), sodium bicarbonate can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bloating, flatulence, and abdominal pain (29962, 104853, 104850). Gastrointestinal side effects during exercise can be reduced when single doses of 200-300 mg/kg are taken 3 hours before with a high-carbohydrate meal (106250). Taking enteric-coated or delayed-release formulations may also reduce the incidence and severity of mild gastrointestinal symptoms (104853, 106250), but enteric-coated formulations may also reduce overall absorption of bicarbonate (104853).\n\nSodium bicarbonate antacids may cause serious gastrointestinal effects, including stomach rupture, if taken orally as a partially dissolved slurry rather than a solution, especially if taken when overly full from food or drink (25735, 25736, 29414, 29415, 29416, 90913).\nless\nHematologic\nIn patients with normal kidney function, appropriate use of oral sodium bicarbonate may not cause significant alkalosis, although it may increase loss of sodium, chloride, potassium, and volume due to diuresis (25733). However, excessive use or chronic oral intake of sodium bicarbonate may induce metabolic alkalosis characterized by levels of sodium bicarbonate ≥40 mEq/L, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hypernatremia (25733, 29962, 106255). When administered intravenously, the most common complication of sodium bicarbonate is hypokalemia (25709). Hypocalcemia or hypernatremia may also occur, although these effects are less common and typically associated with overaggressive therapy (25709, 106255).\n\nAt least two cases of hypernatremia resulting from topical application of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been reported (29962, 90914).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nMetabolic alkalosis induced by sodium bicarbonate has reportedly been associated with tetany that results from hypocalcemia; however, this condition is rare (25709).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, concomitant use of excessive sodium bicarbonate (intake of \"tablespoons\" of sodium bicarbonate daily or up to one box of baking soda weekly) has been associated with at least two cases of hypercalcemia-induced metabolic alkalosis, characterized by dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness with shivering (25733). Rare symptoms include drowsiness, lethargy, seizures, and coma (106255). Sodium bicarbonate may also cause metabolic alkalosis and the associated symptoms when administered intravenously (13309). However, these effects are typically associated with therapy that is overaggressive.\nless\nOcular/Otic\nAt least three cases of otitis externa have been reported following the use of eardrops containing sodium bicarbonate (25696).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDyspepsia. Over-the-counter oral antacid products containing sodium bicarbonate are considered effective by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nOver-the-counter oral antacid products containing sodium bicarbonate are considered effective by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when taken for up to 2 weeks at a maximum daily dosage of 200 mEq sodium and 200 mEq bicarbonate by patients up to 60 years old and when taken at a maximum daily dosage of 100 mEq sodium and 100 mEq bicarbonate by patients over 60 years old (90912).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral sodium bicarbonate seems to improve athletic performance in most populations. It is unclear if topical or intravenous sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for athletic performance.\nAlthough conflicting research exists, oral sodium bicarbonate seems to improve athletic performance in males and females. This conclusion is the position of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) based on a comprehensive review of the literature (106250). The greatest evidence of benefit, with the lowest risk of adverse effects, is shown for single-dose protocols using 300 mg/kg 60-180 minutes before exercise, or protocols involving intakes of 100-200 mg/kg 2-3 times daily for 3-7 days, for a total daily dose of 400-500 mg/kg. Generally, increasing the dose of sodium bicarbonate above 300 mg/kg does not improve athletic performance and may increase the severity of gastrointestinal adverse effects (25706, 104850, 106250).\n\nMultiple meta-analyses of clinical research in male athletes and non-athletes shows that acute doses of oral sodium bicarbonate, taken as 200-400 mg/kg 40-120 minutes prior to exercise, improves mean performance on sprint exercises by 2% to 16% when compared with controls (25706, 104847). Another meta-analysis shows that oral or intravenous sodium bicarbonate 100-400 mg/kg, taken within 3 hours of exercise, modestly improves exercise performance, total work, performance time, and power, and increases time to exhaustion when compared with placebo (25707). Although the majority of research has been conducted in males, most available evidence also supports the ergogenic effects of sodium bicarbonate in females (25706, 106250, 106252).\n\nIn general, the ergogenic benefits of sodium bicarbonate have been shown in muscular endurance-type activities, as well as high-intensity activities, such as cycling and running, and are especially relevant for single exercise sessions lasting 30 seconds to 12 minutes or for repeated exercise measures (106250). One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that sodium bicarbonate does not improve mean power during sprint tests lasting 10 minutes or longer (25706). Also, although some individual research disagrees (104849), meta-analyses of research assessing athletic performance on Wingate tests, generally lasting up to 30 seconds, shows that acute sodium bicarbonate ingestion does not improve peak or mean power when compared with placebos such as calcium carbonate or sodium chloride (101265, 106243). However, it does produce modest improvements in these measures for repeated performance (106243) or when ingested for 5-7 days (101265).\n\nIn addition to cycling and running, the ergogenic benefits of sodium bicarbonate have been shown in some studies for activities such as swimming and rowing (106250). Although a small study in highly trained rowers found no benefit with sodium bicarbonate (97732), more recent research and a meta-analysis shows that taking sodium bicarbonate 100-300 mg/kg up to 4 hours prior to competition seems to be beneficial for improving mean power during a 2000-meter rowing performance (106245, 106250, 106253). Also, in elite level rowers, clinical research shows that taking sodium bicarbonate 300 mg/kg prior to competition, on an individualized schedule based on time to peak bicarbonate levels, improves rowing performance when compared with using a standardized administration time of 60 minutes prior to performance (106245). The ergogenic effects of sodium bicarbonate have also been shown for middle-distance, but not short-distance, swimming competitions (106249, 106250). A meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking sodium bicarbonate 200-300 mg/kg 60-120 minutes prior to competition has a small benefit on 200-meter and 400-meter swim tests, but not on tests of 100 meters or less (106249).\n\nResearch related to the ergogenic effects of sodium bicarbonate for combat sports or martial arts is mixed (106244, 106250, 109691). Although the ISSN have suggested that the available clinical research shows that sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for combat sports (106250), a recent meta-analysis of clinical research in combat sport athletes, including judo, wrestling, and others, shows that sodium bicarbonate as single or multiple doses does not improve athletic performance, power, or perceived exertion when compared with placebo (109691). Also, a small clinical trial in jiu-jitsu athletes shows that taking sodium bicarbonate before testing does not improve muscle contractions (106244).\n\nOne meta-analysis suggests that the ergogenic effects of sodium bicarbonate are associated with the degree of alkalosis (25707). However, initial research in male athletes shows that although taking 200 mg/kg sodium bicarbonate for 8 days does not significantly increase blood pH, it still improves performance on the Wingate test when compared with a single dose (104849).\n\nMore research is needed to determine if taking sodium bicarbonate during training improves adaptations to exercise or whether sodium bicarbonate is beneficial in multi-sport or multi-day events (106250).\n\nSodium bicarbonate has also been investigated in combination with other ergogenic compounds. There is some clinical evidence showing that combining sodium bicarbonate with beta-alanine or creatine may have additive effects (106250). Although most of the individual studies disagree with these findings, one meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking a combination of sodium bicarbonate, usually a single dose, along with beta-alanine has a moderately greater ergogenic effect than taking beta-alanine alone (94357). Also, a small number of individual studies shows that taking sodium bicarbonate as a single dose or along with creatine improves performance in various sports (106250). More research is needed to determine any additional benefit of combining sodium bicarbonate with caffeine or nitrates (106250).\n\nTopical sodium bicarbonate has also been evaluated. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that topical application of 0.9036 grams/kg of sodium bicarbonate as a specific sodium bicarbonate 33.2% lotion (PR Lotion; Amp Human Performance) 30 minutes prior to exercise does not improve performance on the Wingate test when compared with placebo. This lotion also led to smaller increases in blood pH and bicarbonate ion levels when compared with a single oral dose of sodium bicarbonate 0.3 grams/kg (104848).\nless\nDrug-induced sodium channel blockade. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate seems to be beneficial for the management of drug-induced sodium channel blockade.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that intravenous sodium bicarbonate treats QRS widening following exposure to various drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), cocaine, diphenhydramine, citalopram, some antiarrhythmics, and others. Benefits of sodium bicarbonate may be related to an increased sodium concentration and/or a change in pH. The best evidence of effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate is for TCA-induced sodium channel blockade. Further research is needed to determine the most effective dosing regimen (106257, 106258).\nless\nGingivitis. Brushing the teeth with sodium bicarbonate seems to be beneficial for gingivitis.\nA meta-analysis of seven clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate gingivitis shows that using a 67% bicarbonate toothpaste twice daily for 3-24 weeks has a small beneficial effect on gingivitis, plaque, and bleeding when compared with placebo toothpaste (109692), One specific toothpaste (Parodontax Daily Toothpaste, GlaxoSmithKline) was used in some of the individual studies (98210, 109692).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCardiac arrest. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate does not seem to improve survival in children or adults with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational research shows that sodium bicarbonate administration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults does not improve the survival rate until hospital discharge in patients that had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when compared with no sodium bicarbonate administration. There was also no difference in the rate of return to spontaneous circulation (ROSC), with some preliminary evidence suggesting that the use of sodium bicarbonate actually reduces the incidence of sustained ROSC and the incidence of good neurological outcome at discharge (106247).\n\nThere is also concern regarding the use of sodium bicarbonate in pediatric cardiac arrest. American Heart Association Pediatric Life Support (PLS) guidelines state that sodium bicarbonate administration is not recommended for routine management of cardiac arrest in pediatric patients (106254). A meta-analysis of seven observational studies has found that intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate during pediatric resuscitation actually led to a moderate reduction in the rate of survival until hospital discharge (106246).\n\nThe effect of sodium bicarbonate administration on neurological outcomes in adults with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has also been evaluated. Observational research in a French dataset has found that sodium bicarbonate administration is not associated with neurological outcome after 30 days. However, in North America, sodium bicarbonate administration is associated with 55% decreased odds of having a favorable functional outcome and a 41% reduction in survival (109693).\nless\nIschemia-reperfusion injury. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate does not seem to prevent ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that administering intravenous sodium bicarbonate does not prevent ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury when compared with placebo in adults undergoing cardiac surgery (97733).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical sodium bicarbonate for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nBowel preparation. Sodium bicarbonate is an ingredient in some approved medications for bowel cleansing. However, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate alone for this use.\nBurns. Although there is interest in using topical sodium bicarbonate for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nCancer. Although there is interest in using intratumoral sodium bicarbonate for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for CKD.\nPreliminary clinical studies in adults with stage 3-5 CKD and low serum bicarbonate levels show that taking oral sodium bicarbonate 5.95-11.9 mEq three times daily or 0.4 mEq/kg daily for 12 months increases serum bicarbonate levels, but does not improve kidney function, quality of life, bone mineral density, or physical functioning scores, when compared with placebo (104845, 104851). Some clinical research in adults undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis shows that adding oral sodium bicarbonate 900 mg three times daily for 12 months to prescription dialysis improves nutritional status and reduces the duration of hospitalization, but not number of hospitalizations, when compared with placebo (29940). One preliminary clinical trial shows that taking sodium bicarbonate, titrating up to an average of 3.7 grams daily in two divided doses, for 12 weeks reduces the frequency of hyperkalemia from 11% of measurements at baseline to 4%. Also, pre-dialysis bicarbonate levels were increased by 2.12 mmol/L (109689). However, the target bicarbonate level of 22 mmol/L was not consistently achieved and there was no benefit in lean body mass, muscle strength, or electrocardiogram changes (109689). Also, other clinical research in patients with metabolic acidosis prior to dialysis shows that administering dialysate bicarbonate 40 mEq/L with or without oral sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg daily in three divided doses for 16 weeks does not improve nutritional parameters when compared with dialysate bicarbonate 35 mEq/L alone (29939).\nless\nConstipation. Although there is interest in using oral and topical sodium bicarbonate for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if intravenous sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for contrast induced nephropathy prevention.\nClinical trials evaluating the use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate report conflicting results and utilize heterogeneous doses, comparators, and concomitant therapies. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that intravenous sodium bicarbonate (sodium concentration 80-154 mEq/L) 1 mL/kg/hr for up to 12 hours or 3 mL/kg/hr for 1 hour prior to cardiac angiography, followed by 1 mL/kg/hour for 6-12 hours following cardiac angiography, reduces the risk of contrast induced nephropathy when compared to hydration with normal saline (25714, 25715, 25717, 25718, 25721, 25754, 97036). However, when only studies that compared the effects of sodium bicarbonate plus N-acetylcysteine to normal saline plus N-acetylcysteine are considered, the favorable effect of sodium bicarbonate was less significant or not significantly different (25715, 25717), suggesting that N-acetylcysteine may have been responsible for the enhanced effectiveness shown in other studies. Additionally, most of the analyses note that significant heterogeneity exists among the published studies.\n\nWhen only large, higher methodological quality, randomized controlled trials are considered, sodium bicarbonate does not appear to reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy when compared to hydration with sodium chloride (25716, 25721, 97036). Clinical research shows that sodium bicarbonate does not appear to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, the need for renal replacement therapy, or mortality when compared with normal saline (25711, 25713, 25714, 25717, 25718, 25721, 25754). Preliminary clinical research in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease also shows that no hydration is similar to hydration with 250 mL of sodium bicarbonate (sodium concentration 170 mEq/L). Follow up after 2-5 days and 7-14 days shows that the relative increase in serum creatinine with no hydration is non-inferior to sodium bicarbonate. However, the volume and concentration of sodium bicarbonate used in this trial was lower than many trials that previously demonstrated benefits (104846). Finally, a meta-analysis of the available literature suggests that xanthine and statins are superior to both sodium bicarbonate and normal saline for the treatment of contrast induced nephropathy (97036).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if brushing the teeth or rinsing the mouth with sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for dental plaque reduction.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that brushing teeth one time with 1.5 grams of toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate 20% to 65% removes plaque better than brushing teeth with toothpaste containing triclosan/copolymer or fluoride/silica and no sodium bicarbonate, particularly for teeth that are difficult to reach with a toothbrush (25708). Products assessed in the analysis included Arm & Hammer Dental Care, Arm & Hammer Advanced White Brilliant Sparkle, Arm & Hammer Advance White Baking Soda and Peroxide, and Arm & Hammer Liquid Gel (Church & Dwight Co. Inc.). However, the meta-analysis is limited by the fact that most studies were only single-brushing crossover comparisons. Therefore, it is not clear if sodium bicarbonate-containing toothpastes are significantly better than toothpastes that do not contain sodium bicarbonate when used long-term. Additionally, some limited research suggests that sodium bicarbonate seems to work as well as fluoride in toothpaste for removing dental plaque. One small clinical study shows that brushing teeth once with toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate 20% to 67% is no different for reducing plaque than brushing teeth with control toothpaste containing 0.312% fluoride (101264).\n\nPreliminary clinical research also shows that using an oral rinse (Periogen) containing sodium bicarbonate, sodium fluoride, and multiple other ingredients for 60 seconds, twice daily for 3 days, decreases dental plaque and bleeding by a small amount when compared with baseline in healthy patients who did not brush their teeth during the study (97731).\nless\nEarwax. It is unclear if ear drops containing sodium bicarbonate are beneficial for removing earwax.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that treatment with sodium bicarbonate solution four drops twice daily for 5 days prior to irrigation improves earwax clearance better than no treatment and similar to Cerumol ear drops. The percentage of ears completely cleared by irrigation after treatment with Cerumol, sodium bicarbonate, and no treatment is 22%, 20%, and 5%, respectively (29936). Other clinical research shows that administering 10% sodium bicarbonate solution four drops daily for 14 days is similarly effective to 2.5% acetic acid solution for reducing the degree of earwax in children and adults with occlusive earwax (29937).\n\nHowever, treatment with sodium bicarbonate solution prior to irrigation may make syringing more difficult when compared to other methods. Some clinical research shows that administering Cerumol ear drops once daily for 3 days prior to syringing makes syringing easier when compared to administering sodium bicarbonate for the same treatment duration in elderly patients (29938).\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Sodium bicarbonate is an ingredient in some approved medications for GERD. However, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate alone for this use.\nHyperkalemia. Although there is interest in using oral and intravenous sodium bicarbonate for hyperkalemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nInfertility. Although there is interest in using intravaginal sodium bicarbonate for infertility, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nInsect bite. Although there is interest in using topical sodium bicarbonate for insect bite treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nJellyfish stings. It is unclear if topical sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for jellyfish stings.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of a sodium bicarbonate 50% slurry on gauze, replaced every 2 minutes for 30 minutes, does not reduce pain associated with jellyfish stings when compared with placebo. However, application of the slurry reduces overall redness (97730).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there is interest in using oral sodium bicarbonate for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for muscle strength.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in healthy adults shows that taking sodium bicarbonate 300-400 mg/kg 1-2 hours before exercise does not improve mean muscle strength when compared with placebo (104852).\nless\nNeonatal resuscitation. It is unclear if intravenous sodium bicarbonate improves outcomes in neonates requiring resuscitation.\nPreliminary clinical research in asphyxiated newborns still requiring positive pressure ventilation at 5 minutes of life shows that intravenous sodium bicarbonate 4 mL/kg (1.8 mEq/kg) for 3-5 minutes does not improve survival or reduce the risk of neurological abnormality, encephalopathy, cerebral edema, need for inotropic support, or risk of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with 5% dextrose (25692).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for chemotherapy-associated oral mucositis.\nClinical research in patients with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis shows that using 7.5 mL of a mouthwash containing sodium bicarbonate 5% for 3 weeks has a moderate to large beneficial effect on the severity of mucositis and quality of life when compared with placebo. The mouthwash was swished for two, two-minute sessions separated by 15 minutes, repeated every 8 hours (109690).\nless\nOrganophosphorus pesticide poisoning. Although there is interest in using intravenous sodium bicarbonate for organophosphorus pesticide poisoning, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nPeptic ulcers. Sodium bicarbonate is an ingredient in some approved medications for peptic ulcers. However, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate alone for this use.\nPoison oak and poison ivy dermatitis.

Although there is interest in using topical sodium bicarbonate for pruritus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for psoriasis.\nIn patients with mild to moderate stable plaque psoriasis, a small clinical trial shows that topical sodium bicarbonate 30% does not improve symptoms of psoriasis when compared with a lanette wax vehicle only (106256).\nless\nSalicylate intolerance. Although there is interest in using intravenous sodium bicarbonate for salicylate intolerance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there is interest in using oral sodium bicarbonate for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sodium bicarbonate reduces the risk of VAP.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults who have been mechanically ventilated for at least 4 days shows that using an oral rinse containing sodium bicarbonate 0.13 grams in 20 mL every 2 hours, in conjunction with tooth brushing three times daily, does not reduce the risk of VAP when compared with sterile water and tooth brushing (97737).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical sodium bicarbonate for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nRhabdomyolysis. Although there is interest in using intravenous sodium bicarbonate for preventing rhabdomyolysis-induced kidney injury, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sodium bicarbonate for this condition.\nTooth discoloration. It is unclear if brushing the teeth with sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for tooth discoloration.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a specific toothpaste containing 35% sodium bicarbonate (Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant Toothpaste, Church & Dwight Co. Inc.) for 2 minutes twice daily for 6 weeks reduces tooth staining by approximately 45% when compared to baseline.

Bicarbonate absorption begins in the stomach and continues in the jejunum (106250).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSodium bicarbonate is a salt that dissociates in aqueous solution to form sodium and bicarbonate ions. This dissociation affords a solution that is alkaline (29411).\nBuffering effects\nIn aqueous solutions, sodium bicarbonate dissociates to produce sodium and bicarbonate ions. Increasing bicarbonate levels in the blood buffers excess hydrogen ions and increases blood pH (29411). This helps treat the clinical manifestations, though not the cause, of metabolic acidosis. Increased bicarbonate in the urine increases urinary pH. This may help dissolve urinary stones. In the stomach, increased bicarbonate can reduce gastric acidity, which can help relieve symptoms associated with conditions such as dyspepsia. Also, sodium bicarbonate may enhance exercise performance by improving intra- and extracellular buffering capacities (25695).\nCardiovascular effects\nSodium bicarbonate reduces ventricular QRS complexes per minute in dogs with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (25739).\nErgogenic effects\nThe ability to perform high-intensity exercise is thought to be limited by the intramuscular buildup of lactic acid. During high-intensity exercise, muscles convert carbohydrates to lactic acid to meet energy demands (90918). The buildup of lactic acid in the muscles is one factor attributed to exercise-induced fatigue (90918). Increased extracellular bicarbonate levels may result in efflux of lactate from skeletal muscle (106250). In humans, sodium bicarbonate increases lactate levels in the blood (106248, 109691).\n\nTaking sodium bicarbonate increases pH in a dose-dependent manner (97735, 106248). Greater improvement in exercise performance appears to correlate with a greater increase in pH (25707, 106250). However, there is a large variability in changes in bicarbonate levels and time to highest pH in the blood after supplementation, suggesting that athletes might need to individualize their ingestion protocol and dosing. Time to peak pH ranges from 10-85 minutes after ingestion (97734, 97735). Some research also suggests that taking sodium bicarbonate chronically during training might improve mitochondrial adaptation by reducing accumulation of hydrogen ions (97732).\n\nTaking sodium bicarbonate also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. However, there is no effect on oxygen levels in the blood (106248). Finally, bicarbonate levels in the blood and changes in pH can affect muscle membrane excitability. Some early research shows that sodium bicarbonate increases the efflux of potassium from muscle cells and then increases its reuptake after exercise. This is thought to be related to the potential for preserved muscle cell excitability (106250)."

It continues to be cultivated in regions throughout the world, including Asia, Africa, and the United States. The grains from sorghum are used by many cultures to make staple foods (37254, 97670). For instance, sorghum is used to make kunu, a nonalcoholic cereal beverage commonly consumed in Nigeria (37248). While over 20 different species of sorghum exist throughout the world, Sorghum bicolor is the variety most commonly cultivated, consumed, and studied (104135).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sorghum are the seed and the leaf (18, 97674, 97675). Sorghum seed contains starch, fiber, and protein. It also contains thiamine and riboflavin. Dhurrin, a cyanogenic glycoside, is present in a very low amount in the fruit (0.005-5 mg per 100 grams). In contrast, the foliage contains a much higher level (250-700 mg per 100 grams) (18, 97670). The leaf contains anthocyanins, anthocyanidines, and deoxyanthocyanidins, especially apigenin dimers, apigenindin-flavene dimers, and luteolinidins (97672, 97675). The grain contains a protein, kafirin, which makes up as much as 70% of the total protein (97670). It also contains phenolic compounds such as deoxyanthocyanins, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, other hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoid glycosides (97671, 97673, 97676).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro, sorghum grain extract inhibits the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells (97676).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, kafirin, the major protein in sorghum grain, reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferes with cellular processes involved in inflammation (97670).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, sorghum grain extracts have antioxidant effects due to the constituent hydroxycinnamic acids and anthocyanin-related compounds (97671, 97676). The clinical relevance is unclear.\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro, sorghum leaf extract has antiparasitic activity; this effect is thought to be related to specific anthocyanidins in sorghum (97672).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSorghum is thought to have a soothing effect on the alimentary tract (18).\nHepatic effects\nThere is interest in using sorghum to prevent hepatic impairment associated with obesity and other metabolic conditions. Research in rats fed a high-fat diet shows that consuming flour made from extruded sorghum reduces liver weight and hepatic lipogenesis, although the precise mechanism of these effects is unclear (103899)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sorrel are the above ground parts (94018). Flavan-3-ols and oligomeric proanthocyanidins including procyanidin B2-di-gallate, are the main active components of sorrel (94020). It also contains 3% to 15% tannins, consisting of a mixture of proanthocyanidins, including procyanidins and propelargonidins (11, 94018). Sorrel leaves also contain around 0.3% oxalate (71314, 94019). This combines with calcium in plasma to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that may precipitate in the kidneys, blood vessels, and liver (71314, 75138, 94019). Other constituents of sorrel include ascorbic acid, anthracene derivatives including anthraquinones, quinoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and polysaccharides (75137, 75146, 94018).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that a high concentration of Essiac, a tea containing sorrel and other ingredients, has inhibitory effects on various human cancer cell lines (75136). Other in vitro research shows that anthraquinones isolated from the aerial parts of sorrel may have cytotoxic effects on cultured human tumor cell lines (75137). Animal research suggests that a polysaccharide constituent of sorrel might have antitumor activity, possibly due to complement (C3) activation, phagocytic activity, or inhibition of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes (13425).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThere is conflicting evidence about sorrel's activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (75139, 94021). In one in vitro study, it had no activity (75139), but in another in vitro study, an acetone-water proanthocyanidin-enriched extract of sorrel demonstrated activity against HSV-1. It interfered with glycoproteins in the viral envelope which are involved in viral attachment, and at higher concentrations, it was able to block the penetration of viral particles already attached to the cell. Proanthocyanidins and flavan-3-ols were thought to be responsible for the antiviral effects (94021).\n\nIn vitro research shows that sorrel extract has activity against influenza A virus, by directly interacting with virus particles, blocking viral adsorption, interfering with penetration at higher concentrations, and interfering with cell surface receptor binding of viral hemagglutinin. Procyanidin B2-di-gallate is the main constituent of sorrel extract thought to be responsible for the antiviral effect, the content of which is about 1% (94020).\n\nA small clinical study in adults with Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the mouth, but no evidence of periodontitis, shows that using a mouthwash containing 0.8% of a proanthocyanidin-enriched extract of sorrel, 10 mL three times daily for 7 days with routine oral hygiene, does not reduce colonization with P. gingivalis or improve periodontal health when compared with placebo (107874).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that sorrel does not have activity against adenovirus type 3 (94021), herpes simplex virus-2, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, or Staphylococcus aureus (75139).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro, a methanolic extract of sorrel inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanisms include inhibition of intracellular mobilization of calcium, decreased ATP release in the platelets, and blocking of fibrinogen binding to integrins (103607)."

            "Overview": "Soybean is a legume that originated in China, but is now grown in other countries, including North and South America (90991, 90992). Soybeans are processed into soy milk, soy fiber, or soy protein, which includes soy powder, soy protein concentrate, and isolated soy protein products (90993). Soy is a primary source of phytoestrogens called isoflavones, a class of compounds that are structurally similar to endogenous estrogen (90954).",
            "Warnings": "The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 2004 recognizes soy as a major food allergen in the United States and requires that soy contents be labeled on packaged food and supplement products (105410).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when soy protein is used orally and appropriately. Soy protein products in doses up to 60 grams, providing up to 185 mg isoflavones, daily have been safely used in studies lasting up to 16 weeks (842, 2293, 2294, 2296, 3025, 3402, 3977, 4755, 6412, 8530)( 10372,11805).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when soy extracts are used orally and appropriately, short-term. Soy extracts containing concentrated isoflavones in doses of 35-120 mg daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 6 months (4751, 6455, 7802, 12040, 12048, 13209, 95994, 95999).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods or as a component of infant formula (3400, 4912, 7331). Soy milk that's not designed for infants should not be used as a substitute for infant formula. Regular soy milk can lead to nutrient deficiencies (12045). Most evidence shows that exposure to soy formula or other soy products in infancy does not cause early onset of puberty or health or reproductive problems later in life (7331, 11080, 108245). However, some small cohort studies have suggested that higher soy intake during childhood may be associated with an increased risk of precocious puberty (108240) and may be weakly correlated with the development of breasts in children less than 2 years of age (75520). This is in contrast to an observational study in Chinese children ages 7-9 years which suggests that higher soy intake is associated with delayed puberty (108252). One small cohort study has also found that use of soy infant formula may be associated with an increased risk of endometriosis in adulthood, although endometriosis was also correlated with prematurity, which may have confounded the findings (101803).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally as an alternative to cow's milk in children with severe milk allergy (75359). Although soy protein-based infant formulas are often promoted for children with milk allergy, children with a severe allergy to cow's milk are also frequently sensitive to soy protein (9883). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of soy products when used in amounts higher than typical food quantities for children.\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (4912).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in medicinal amounts. Soy contains mildly estrogenic constituents (3373, 3988, 3989, 3990, 3994, 6029, 75303). Theoretically, therapeutic use of soy might adversely affect fetal development; avoid using.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (4912). A single 20-gram dose of roasted soybeans, containing 37 mg isoflavones, produces four to six times less isoflavones in breast milk than provided in a soy-based infant formula (2290). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of long-term use of therapeutic amounts of soy during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, soy is well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.\n\nAll ROAs: Allergic reactions.\nEndocrine\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, cases of altered thyroid function, particularly goiter, were reported in children taking soy formula. However, adding iodine to soy formula or replacing soy flour in formula with soy protein isolate has nearly eliminated the risk of altered thyroid function in most infants (75353, 75651).\n\nIn adults, there is some evidence that soy intake can alter thyroid function. Results from one clinical trial suggests that consuming soybeans 30 grams daily for as little as one month can increase thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and decrease thyroxine, causing diffuse goiters, constipation, fatigue, and lethargy in some Japanese men. Recovery was achieved by discontinuing soybean intake (75206, 75353). There is also some evidence that soy inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis resulting in increased secretion of TSH in some postmenopausal patients (7806). However, this seems to only occur in people with iodine deficiency (6466, 75311). In postmenopausal patients with normal levels of iodine, taking a soy extract for 6 months does not seem to significantly affect thyroid hormone levels (13010).\n\nEvidence from a single case-control study suggests that consumption of soy-based formulas may be associated with an observed three-fold increase in the risk of breast development in Puerto Rican children less than 2 years-old (75520). The correlation has been attributed to the estrogenic activity of soy. However, other risk factors, including a maternal history of ovarian cysts and consumption of meat products were also associated with the increased risk of breast development prior to 2 years of age. Also, the investigators noted that in over half of the cases, the child had not been exposed to soy or any of the other risk factors. Therefore, factors other than soy consumption may be more strongly associated with the increased risk of breast development prior to 2 years of age.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal upset, such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and nausea are the most common side effects of soy (2297, 11033, 11082, 15851, 75491, 95999). Reports of \"bad taste\" and taste intolerance have also been documented in clinical research (15851, 39007, 75491). Firmer stools, diarrhea, colitis, and intestinal mucosal damage has been reported in infants fed soy protein formula (75161, 75448, 75516, 75525).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, soy might increase discomfort during menstrual periods. Evidence from a small, retrospective cohort study has found that consuming soy formula as an infant may slightly increase the duration and discomfort of menstrual periods later in life. However, the investigators noted that these differences may not be clinically significant (7331).\n\nOrally, frequent soy consumption might be a risk factor for uterine leiomyoma, an estrogen-dependent benign tumor located on the uterus. Observational research found that consumption of soy milk or soybean at least four times weekly is associated with a 7-fold increased odds of uterine leiomyoma (98869).\n\nThere is some concern that use of soy-based formulas in infants might result in long-term health complications. However, results from a retrospective cohort study has found that intake of soy-based formula as an infant does not affect height, weight, body mass index, pubertal maturation, menstrual history, or pregnancy history, nor does it increase the risk of reproductive organ disorders, hormonal disorders, libido dysfunction, or birth defects in the offspring of adults who received soy formula as infants (7331, 11080). Additionally, research in adults shows that urinary phytoestrogens are not associated with endometriosis risk (101804). However, some population research has found that regular exposure to soy-based formulas during infancy is associated with an increased risk for endometriosis (101803).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, soy can cause allergic reactions such as skin rash and itching in some people (6412). In an 11-year-old female, allergy to soy protein resulting in a delayed itching papular rash was thought to be responsible for the reaction to injected benzathine benzylpenicillin containing possible soy protein-contaminated soy lecithin (96422).\n\nTopically, soy-based ingredients were responsible for the development of hand atopic dermatitis in a young female using cosmetic lotions in the workplace. Percutaneous sensitization resulted in the development of anaphylaxis to oral soy (96000).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, one clinical study showed that insomnia was more common in postmenopausal adults taking soy isoflavone supplements when compared with those receiving placebo (9917).\n\nSome research suggests that dietary consumption of tofu during midlife might decrease cognitive function in later years. Evidence from one retrospective cohort study suggests that males who consume at least two servings of tofu weekly during midlife have increased risk of cognitive impairment in late life (19% vs. 4%) compared to those who consume tofu less frequently. Although the effect of tofu was considered to be marginal compared to other factors such as age, education, or history of stroke, results from the study suggest that the effect of significant midlife consumption of tofu is comparable to the effect of an age difference of 4 years or an education difference of 3 years. However, numerous other factors, such as lifestyle and health, could be involved (6415, 6416). Therefore, these findings are too preliminary to be used as a basis for clinical recommendations.\nless\nOncologic\nThere is controversy about the role of soy in breast cancer. Population studies suggest that soy is protective against breast cancer. Asian females who eat a traditional diet high in soy seem to have a lower risk of developing breast cancer (4590, 5939, 9674). Early exploratory studies have suggested that soy stimulates proliferation of normal human breast tissue (3980, 3981). However, taking a soy tablet containing 50 mg soy isoflavones daily for 12 months does not alter mammographic or breast MRI tissue density in adults at high risk of breast cancer, with non-endocrine treated breast cancer, or previously treated for breast cancer and without evidence of recurrence (95999).\n\nThere is some concern that soy supplements, but not soy foods, might increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects. Population and clinical research suggests that soy foods do not have a proliferative effect on endometrial cells (7358, 2429, 7654, 9676, 9917), and increased dietary soy and phytoestrogens are associated with reduced endometrial cancer risk (7338, 10372). However, the effects seem to be different with concentrated soy isoflavone extract. While taking products providing isoflavones 120 mg daily for 6 months does not increase endometrial thickening (13209), taking higher doses such as isoflavones 150 mg daily for 5 years might increase the risk of simple endometrial hyperplasia (12105). However, there is no evidence that soy isoflavones increase the risk of atypical hyperplasia which has a much higher risk of developing into endometrial cancer than simple endometrial hyperplasia (12105, 90973).\n\nThere is also concern that increased soy intake increases the risk for other types of cancer. Some observational research has found that higher dietary intake of soy is associated with a higher risk for bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer (9677, 105609).\n\nA meta-analysis of results from cohort and case-control studies evaluating the risk of stomach cancer related to consumption of fermented soy products is unclear and inconclusive. The highest quality data from cohort studies suggests that these products have no significant effect on stomach cancer (7340, 7341). More research is required to determine if soy products have any correlation with stomach cancer.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nInhaled soy dust and soy hull aeroallergen can trigger symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis (5084, 5085, 5086).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBreast cancer. High dietary intake of soy might be beneficial for the prevention of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence in some patients. However, soy supplements do not seem to be beneficial.\nFor prevention, most population research has found that higher dietary intake of soy is associated with up to a 26% reduced odds of developing breast cancer when compared with a lower intake (7335, 7336, 11038, 11807, 75377, 75587, 90955, 108251). One meta-analysis of population research found that patients who consumed more than 15 mg soy isoflavones daily made up about 25% of all cases of breast cancer, compared with 75% of cases in the group of patients consuming less than 15 mg daily (108251). The effects appear to vary depending on the ethnicity of the patient. Population research has consistently found that a high-soy diet in Asian and Asian-American females is associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (7335, 7336, 11038, 11807, 75377, 75587, 90955). However, the amount of soy consumed in a Western diet, even among those who consume the highest amounts of soy, was not found to have a preventative effect (11391, 17109, 90955, 90967). The reason for the disparate findings are unknown but may be related to genetic differences or differences in quantification of soy intake (7663, 94153). Also, the prophylactic benefit seems to apply regardless of whether high amounts of soy are consumed during adolescence or later in life (7335, 7336, 9674).\n\nLimited population research has also found that consuming a diet high in soy is associated with up to a 25% reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence; however, it is unclear whether there is an association with reduced mortality in breast cancer patients (90956, 90969, 94154). The effect appears to be greater for certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. Increased dietary soy intake is associated with a 28% to 36% risk reduction in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, a 30% risk reduction in patients with ER-positive/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumors, and a 25% to 36% risk reduction in postmenopausal patients (90956).\n\nSome small clinical studies have also evaluated the use of soy isoflavone extract . One small clinical study in patients with breast cancer shows that taking a soy isoflavone extract 200 mg daily for 2 weeks prior to surgery does not seem to affect cancer cell growth when compared with a historical control (11042). Another small clinical study in patients at high risk for breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer shows that taking a soy tablet containing 50 mg soy isoflavones (Novasoy, Archer Daniels Midland Co.) daily for 12 months does not alter mammographic or breast tissue density when compared with placebo (95999).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral soy protein seems to improve some measures of disease severity in patients with CKD.\nClinical research shows that consuming soy protein seems to reduce proteinuria in people with kidney disease (2286, 2287, 2288, 75249, 75634). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis shows that soy protein intake reduces serum levels of creatinine by 0.07 mg/dL, phosphorus by 2.5 mg/dL, and triglyceride by 18 mg/dL when compared with placebo or control (90989).\nless\nDiabetes. Diets high in soy seem to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Also, oral soy protein, but not soy isoflavones, seems to modestly improve glycemic indices. It is unclear if soy is beneficial for lowering blood lipid levels or reducing cardiovascular (CVD) mortality risk in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of observational studies has found that higher dietary intake of tofu, soy protein, or soy isoflavones is associated with an 8% to 16% lower risk of developing diabetes when compared with a lower dietary intake (105608). In menopausal patients without diabetes, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intake of soy isoflavones 40-161 mg daily seems to improve glycemic indices when compared with control (96423).\n\nSome research shows that soy can modestly improve glycemic indices in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of small low-quality clinical studies in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome shows that taking various formulations of soy protein modestly reduces fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with control (96001). An older meta-analysis assessing both healthy patients and patients with diabetes shows that a whole soy diet reduces fasting blood glucose by about 4 mg/dL when compared with control (75493). Small clinical studies also suggest that an extract of the fermented soybean product, Touchi, acts as an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It seems to modestly lower blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and triglycerides in patients with type 2 diabetes (11762, 75205). However, some conflicting evidence exists. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking soy isoflavones does not improve glycemic indices when compared with control (105610). Also, another meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking soy protein and/or soy isoflavones for 6-12 weeks does not improve glycemic indices when compared with either soy protein without isoflavones, other protein, or placebo (105610). Reasons for these conflicting results are unclear but may relate to differences in baseline blood glucose levels, the formulation of soy, or the duration of treatment.\n\nSome research shows that soy may modestly improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that taking soy protein and/or soy isoflavones for 6-12 weeks modestly reduces levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with control (105610).\n\nConsuming soy foods might reduce the risk of mortality related to CVD in patients with diabetes. Population research suggests that consuming soy foods at least four days each week is associated with a 23% reduced risk of CVD mortality when compared with never consuming soy foods. Consuming soy foods less than four times weekly is not associated with CVD mortality risk (108242).\n\nSoy is also of interest in the prevention or treatment of gestational diabetes. Population research has found that consumption of less than 40 grams of soy daily in the second trimester is associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk of gestational diabetes when compared with daily soy intake of 40 grams or more (108241). Also, a small clinical trial in patients with gestational diabetes shows that consuming a diet containing about 0.3 grams/kg soy protein for 6 weeks, beginning at 24-28 weeks' gestation, reduces blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and triglyceride levels when compared with consuming a non-soy control diet (95993).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral soy fiber seems to reduce acute diarrhea in infants, although it may not be beneficial in adults.\nGiving soy fiber-supplemented formula orally, either alone or in combination with oral rehydration solution, seems to reduce the duration of acute diarrhea in infants when compared with cow's milk formula or oral rehydration solution alone (2291, 2292, 75474, 75517, 75523, 75531, 75572). However, in some studies, a reduction in the duration of acute diarrhea was not observed when compared with cow's milk formula (75522, 75542).\n\nIn adult patients receiving nutrition via intubation, preliminary clinical research suggests that treatment with soy-polysaccharide fiber does not improve the incidence of diarrhea when compared to control (75508).\nless\nGalactosemia. Oral soy protein can be used in infant formula to prevent symptoms of galactosemia.\nSoy does not contain the sugar galactose. Some research suggests that giving oral isolated soy protein-based formula in place of milk-based formula to infants seems to be helpful for preventing symptoms of galactosemia (3400).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral soy protein seems to modestly reduce lipid levels. However, purified soy isoflavone may not have the same benefit.\nConsuming soy protein orally, in place of other dietary protein, seems to modestly reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 3% to 4% when compared with control (842, 2293, 2294, 2296, 2585, 3402, 4755, 6412, 7346, 7803)(8530, 10459, 42059, 75356, 105598, 105604). Additionally, some research shows that soy protein might be more effective in patients with more severe hyperlipidemia (75497). The FDA has approved labeling for specific soy products that states that they may be used for cholesterol reduction in combination with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. To be eligible for this labeling, soy products must provide at least 6.25 grams of soy protein per serving, which is 25% of the effective daily intake (3977).\n\nHowever, not all evidence is positive. Some studies have shown no benefit of soy protein or isoflavones on LDL cholesterol levels when compared to control (8521, 9679, 12034, 17105, 53771, 75236)(75242, 75274, 75276). Furthermore, although a few clinical trials have shown significant decreases in triglycerides following supplementation with soy or soy protein isolate (75258, 75365), most studies suggest that soy protein does not decrease triglycerides when compared to control (2293, 6412, 8530, 12034, 17105). The effect of soy protein on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is inconsistent. Most studies suggest that it does not increase HDL levels (2293, 6412, 8530, 12034, 75286)(75524), although some analyses of clinical research suggest that soy might increase HDL cholesterol levels by up to 4% when compared to control (75480, 75497).\n\nDoses of soy protein have ranged from 25-135 grams daily, providing 40-318 mg daily of isoflavones; however, higher doses do not seem to be more effective (17106, 105598). Some evidence suggests that soy protein providing more isoflavones, or supplemented with isoflavones, might be more effective (3402, 6413, 10459), but this has not been consistently found in studies (3402). Most studies evaluating soy protein products containing little to no isoflavones suggest that these products are not effective (3402, 7346, 9679); however, purified soy isoflavone supplements alone do not seem to decrease LDL cholesterol (851, 4738, 7345, 8502, 10459, 14066). In addition to soy protein, limited evidence suggests that soy fiber alone might reduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (75686, 75689). There is also some evidence that ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment of soy milk destroys any cholesterol-lowering activity (17106).\nless\nHypertension. Oral soy seems to modestly reduce blood pressure in some patients.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that consuming soy products modestly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 1.6 mmHg and 1.2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with control (105605). This analysis is limited by high risk of bias and the lack of a dose-response relationship. An older meta-analysis, as well as individual clinical studies, in patients with prehypertension or mild hypertension show that consuming soy protein 18-40 grams, providing 118-143 mg of isoflavones, daily or black soy peptide 4.5 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 4-8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 3-5 mmHg when compared with control (1313990962, 90965). In normotensive patients, soy protein does not seem to reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure (90965).\nless\nLactose intolerance. Oral soy protein can be used in infant formula to prevent symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nProviding isolated soy protein-based formula orally to infants is an acceptable alternative to milk-based formulas, especially for infants with symptoms of lactose intolerance (3400).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral soy seems to reduce hot flashes in patients with menopausal symptoms.\nConsuming soy protein 15-60 grams, providing 34-100 mg of isoflavones, daily seems to modestly decrease the frequency and severity of hot flashes in some menopausal adults. Improvement seems to be greater in those with a higher frequency of hot flashes at baseline (2296, 2297, 3978, 3986, 3987, 7653, 9917, 11805, 15220, 17110, 75478)(75486, 75649, 92661, 95997). Taking concentrated soy isoflavone extracts, providing 35-200 mg of isoflavones, daily seems to have similar effects (4751, 6455, 7802, 9916, 10460, 11805, 11993, 11994, 13209, 15220)(15850, 75478, 90950, 90979, 92661). Higher doses of 100-200 mg of isoflavones daily and higher frequency of dosing intervals seem to have greater benefit (90950). Furthermore, the amount of the specific isoflavone genistein contained in a soy product may influence outcomes. According to one analysis, studies using products that provide at least 15 mg of genistein daily consistently show positive outcomes. Studies using products containing a lower concentration of genistein have produced inconsistent findings (15133). Not all research has found that soy extracts reduce hot flashes (7801, 11806, 14062, 15038, 15851, 16762); some experts speculate that this is due to a high placebo response (9916).\n\nSome clinical research has compared soy isoflavone extracts to conventional estrogen replacement. In one study, a concentrated soy isoflavone extract of genistein 54 mg daily reduced hot flashes by 22% to 29%, compared to 54% in those taking 17beta-estradiol as 1 mg daily plus norethisterone acetate 0.5 mg daily (11994). Additional preliminary research suggests that taking a soy isoflavone extract providing 60 mg isoflavones twice daily is comparable in efficacy to conjugated estrogens 0.625 daily for reducing menopausal symptoms. Conjugated estrogens seem to work more quickly; it seems to take up to 2 months to achieve the full effect of soy isoflavones (13209). One clinical trial compared soy isoflavones 10-40 mg daily to S-equol, a soy isoflavone metabolite. Soy isoflavones were less effective for reducing hot flash frequency when compared with S-equol (90960). This has led to some speculation that the effectiveness of soy in relieving hot flashes is influenced by a patient's ability to convert daidzen, a soy isoflavone, to S-equol (90950). It is theorized that patients who are S-equol producers are more likely to achieve symptom relief from soy. However, observational and clinical research does not support this theory (90990, 94162).\n\nSoy has also been evaluated for the management of other symptoms of menopause. Some clinical research in menopausal patients with depression suggests that taking soy 100 mg, providing 50 mg of soy isoflavones, in combination with sertraline 50 mg daily for three months improves depression severity when compared with sertraline or soy alone (90958). An analysis of two small clinical trials shows that supplemental soy providing 50-118 mg of isoflavones can reduce vaginal dryness scores by 0.26 when compared with control (92661). Also, an open-label study suggests that drinking a specific beverage (ViveSoy) containing soy protein 15 grams and soy isoflavones 50 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces overall urogenital symptoms when compared with a control group (95997). However, one small clinical study in perimenopausal patients shows that a soy-rich diet does not relieve urogenital symptoms, including vaginal dryness, itching, and urinary incontinence, when compared with a soy-free diet (75285).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral soy protein seems to improve glycemic control and other markers of metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome shows that following a diet high in soy protein can decrease fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with a control diet. Furthermore, dietary intake of soy protein modestly decreases diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by a small amount in this population, although there is no effect on systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides (96001). Other clinical research shows that consuming a soy nut diet or a soy protein diet reduces fasting plasma glucose and LDL cholesterol levels when compared to baseline in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome; however, the soy nut diet seems to more beneficial than either the soy protein diet or a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (75378).\nless\nMuscle strength. Oral soy protein seems to increase muscle strength.\nOverall, soy protein combined with resistance training seems to increase muscle strength when compared with placebo (16748, 75246, 96942, 98871). A meta-analysis of three clinical studies shows that consuming soy protein in addition to resistance training improves strength and lean body mass in untrained athletes (98871). Other clinical research shows that soy also improves muscle strength in trained athletes and postmenopausal adults (75246, 96942). One study in Olympic endurance athletes shows that consuming isolated soy protein (Supro) 1.5 grams/kg daily for 8 weeks increases body mass and strength indices and reduces fatigue when compared with no protein supplementation (75246). Clinical research in postmenopausal adults undergoing resistance training 3 days weekly shows that taking soy protein 25 grams daily in skim milk for 16 weeks increases the maximum amount of weight lifted in one repetition by over 80% for both bench press and knee extension when compared to a maltodextrin placebo (96942).\n\nSoy protein has also been compared with other protein supplements. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical studies and other clinical research show that soy protein seems to work as well as whey, beef, and dairy (casein and whey) protein for improving muscle strength (75404, 85941, 98871, 105591). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the small size and high heterogeneity of the studies.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral soy isoflavones seem to improve bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis in post-menopausal adults.\nMost clinical research suggests that soy protein or soy extract containing 75-90 mg of isoflavones can increase bone mineral density (BMD), or slow BMD loss, and improve biochemical markers of bone turnover in peri- and postmenopausal adults when compared with control (842, 4951, 6449, 9775, 11082, 90972, 90980). Lower doses of isoflavones do not seem to be as beneficial. However, some observational research in postmenopausal Japanese adults and Chinese females aged 30-40 years has found that consuming about 50 mg dietary soy isoflavones daily is associated with a higher BMD when compared with lower soy isoflavone intake (7342, 11081). An observational study in postmenopausal Asian patients has found that consuming higher dietary soy protein is associated with a lower risk of developing fractures when compared with lower amounts (13181).\n\nHowever, not all research has been positive. Some conflicting evidence suggests that soy protein does not improve BMD in some postmenopausal adults. The discrepancy in findings may be due to differences in soy formulations, concomitant treatments, or variable patient populations (4952, 12034, 14064, 90978). For example, most evidence shows that soy does not affect BMD in premenopausal patients or bone turnover in adolescents (7660, 8532, 9684, 11086).\n\nIt is theorized that only people who can convert daidzein, a soy isoflavone, to S-equol might obtain benefits from soy (4952). However, clinical research suggests that there is no difference in bone calcium retention between equol producers and nonproducers (95995).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral soy does not seem to reduce BPH symptoms.\nClinical research in patients with BPH shows that taking soy isoflavones 40 mg (Soylife 40, Acatris) daily for 12 months does not improve peak urine flow rate, residual urine volume, symptoms of BPH, or general quality of life when compared with placebo (90983).\nless\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. Oral soy does not seem to reduce the risk for breast cancer-related hot flashes.\nClinical research shows that consuming a soy beverage providing soy isoflavones 90 mg daily or taking a soy extract providing soy isoflavones 50 mg three times daily does not reduce hot flashes in breast cancer survivors (3991, 7658, 8499). Observational research in breast cancer survivors has also found no association between hot flash incidence and soy isoflavone consumption (105602).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral soy does not seem to reduce the risk for colorectal cancer.\nSome observational research from China and Japan has found that intake of soy protein or soy isoflavone is not associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer (105601). Furthermore, some clinical research shows that soy protein powder 58 grams containing isoflavones 83 mg, taken daily for 12 months, does not reduce the proliferation of colorectal epithelial cells in patients with adenomatous polyps when compared to control (75282).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral soy does not seem to reduce muscle soreness after exercise.\nSome clinical research shows that taking soy isoflavone extract 120 mg orally for 30 days prior to exercise doesn't ameliorate muscle soreness caused by exercise when compared with placebo (8524).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral soy improves cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking soy isoflavones (Novasoy, Archer Daniels Midland Co.) 100 mg daily for 6 months does not improve cognition when compared with placebo (96424).\nless\nAndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT)-associated hot flashes. One small clinical study in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT shows that taking soy protein powder 20 grams, providing 160 mg of isoflavones, alone or along with venlafaxine 75 mg, once daily for 12 weeks does not improve the severity of hot flash symptoms when compared with milk protein, with or without venlafaxine (90981).\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral soy reduces asthma symptoms.\nOne population study has found that people with asthma who consume soy foods providing more than 250 mcg of genistein for every 1000 kcal consumed (e.g., 500 mcg/day for 2000 kcal diet) daily have increased lung function, as measured by FEV1 scores, when compared to those who consume less (11084). However, clinical research in adult and pediatric patients with poorly controlled asthma shows that taking soy isoflavones 50 mg twice daily for 24 weeks does not improve FEV1 scores, reduce the number of asthma episodes, or improve asthma symptoms when compared with placebo (90977).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if soy consumption reduces the risk for CVD or CVD-related mortality. More research is needed to determine whether certain populations may benefit from increased soy intake.\nDue to mixed findings, it is unclear if consuming soy is associated with a reduced risk of CVD events. One population study has found that consuming at least 60 grams of soy daily over a 12-month period is associated with a 14% reduced risk of having a CVD event over the next 5 years, as well as a reduced risk of stroke, when compared with consuming less than 15 grams daily (108253). A study in Japan has found that consuming soy five or more times per week over a 10-year period is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular outcomes in only a certain subset of patients when compared with consuming soy twice a week or less. Postmenopausal adults with the highest consumption had a 36% lower risk of stroke, a 45% lower risk of myocardial infarction, and a 65% lower risk of CVD mortality. However, risk was not significantly reduced in males or premenopausal adults (17108). In contrast, a study in Korea has found that consuming a median of 16.5 servings of soy per week is associated with a 64% reduced risk of CVD incidence in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, adults when compared with a median of 4.7 servings per week. A subgroup analysis has found that the highest intake of tofu, but not soybeans, fermented soy paste, or soy milk, is associated with a reduced incidence of CVD (108243). Additionally, higher dietary intake of soy does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in Western females (13040). The amount of phytoestrogens typically consumed in Western diets is significantly lower than the amount typically consumed in Asian diets. The form of soy food and isoflavone content might play a role in these discrepancies.\n\nAny association between consumption of soy-containing foods and CVD mortality is also unclear. A meta-analysis of observational studies conducted in China or Japan has found that the highest intake of soy-containing foods is not associated with a lower risk of CVD-related mortality when compared with the lowest intake (96941). A population study in patients with or without a prior history of CVD has also found that soy-containing food consumption is not associated with a lower risk of CVD-related mortality when compared with the lowest intake (108244). However, some research has found a positive effect of soy consumption on CVD mortality risk. A subgroup analysis of a meta-analysis has found that the highest intake of fermented soy products is associated with a 16% reduced risk of CVD mortality; higher intake of non-fermented soy is not associated with CVD mortality (96941). Population research in patients without a prior history of CVD has found that soy-containing food consumption is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction-related mortality when compared with the lowest intake (108244). Also, one population study in adults with type 2 diabetes has found that consuming soy-containing foods at least four days each week is associated with a 23% reduced risk of CVD mortality when compared with never consuming soy foods. Consuming soy foods less than four times weekly is not associated with CVD-related mortality (108242).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral soy reduces the risk for cervical cancer.\nPopulation research has found that the highest dietary intake of soy over approximately 17 years is associated with a 57% decreased risk of cervical cancer when compared to the lowest intake of soy in females who also drank green tea. However, neither soy intake nor green tea intake alone was associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer. Additionally, other population research has not confirmed an association between soy intake and cervical cancer (101800).\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral soy protein enhances child growth.\nPreliminary clinical research in Colombian children 2-7 years of age shows that consuming a soy protein supplement dissolved in fruit juice on 6 days of every week for 1 year does not improve body mass index, body composition, weight, or height when compared with consuming fruit juice and whole milk. A sub-analysis shows that children consuming the soy protein supplement had an increase in weight-for-age when compared with the control group, indicating that the supplement may be beneficial for ensuring adequate weight and nutritional status during prepubertal growth (100320). However, the children in this study had normal or below average weight-for-age at baseline, limiting the applicability of these findings to other patient populations.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral soy improves cognitive function; research is conflicting.\nSome research shows that college students who increase consumption of soy foods providing isoflavones 100 mg daily have improved short- and long-term memory (9671). Postmenopausal patients aged 50-65 years who take a soy extract supplement providing isoflavones 60 mg daily also seem to have some improvement in some measures of cognitive function (12048). There is also evidence in postmenopausal patients aged 55-75 years that taking a soy extract supplement providing isoflavones 110 mg daily might improve verbal memory scores (12040). However, another study in this population shows that consuming 25.6 grams daily of soy protein providing 99 mg of isoflavones does not improve cognitive function (12034). Similarly, population research in females aged 42-52 years has found that increasing dietary intake of the isoflavones genistein and daidzein is not associated with improved measures of cognitive function (15042). These differing findings might be explained by variations in study design and soy formulations.\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral soy has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults 55 years of age and older with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a specific combination product (DW2009) containing fermented soybean powder and Lactobacillus plantarum daily for 12 weeks modestly improves composite cognitive function when compared with placebo (100319). It is not clear if this effect is due to soy, lactobacillus, or the combination.\nless\nColic. It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial in infants with colic.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming soy-based formula might reduce the duration of colic symptoms in infants with cows' milk intolerance (75509, 75543). However, other clinical research shows that consuming soy-based formula does not improve crying in infants with colic when compared with dicyclomine hydrochloride 3 mg/kg daily (75573). Also, a meta-analysis of only high quality clinical research shows that soy milk formula does not improve the persistence of colic or the duration of crying in infants with colic when compared with control (75611).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral soy improves symptoms of Crohn disease.\nA small observational study in patients with inactive Crohn disease has found that taking oral soy-derived protein in combination with enteral treatment for 4 weeks is associated with increased bowel movements, improved symptoms such as fatigue and mental strain, and increased body weight when compared with standard enteral treatment alone (75175).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral soy improves kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that consuming soy products, such as soy protein and soy milk, modestly reduces proteinuria and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose, when compared with animal protein or cow's milk. However, there was no effect on any measures of kidney function (108247). Some individual small clinical trials show that replacing dietary animal protein with soy protein reduces urinary albumin excretion in patients with diabetic nephropathy (7348, 12555, 12556). However, one small clinical study shows that consuming soy milk 240 mL daily for 4 weeks does not affect urinary creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, proteinuria, or glomerular filtration rate in patients with diabetic nephropathy (90966).\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral soy protein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild or moderate dyspepsia shows that consuming 1 gram of toasted soy flour fermented with Lactobacillus delbrueckii up to three times daily for 3 weeks does not improve heartburn severity or frequency when compared with placebo (105599).\nless\nEndometrial cancer. It is unclear if oral soy protein reduces the risk for endometrial cancer.\nMost epidemiological research has found that increased soy intake is associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer incidence is lower in Japan, China, and other Asian countries where the typical diet is low in calories and high in soy, whole grain foods, vegetables, and fruits (7338, 11036, 90954). Also, a large meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest total and fermented soy intake is associated with a 17% to 19% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer when compared to the lowest intakes in postmenopausal adults (96002). However, one clinical study shows that taking soy protein 25 grams daily providing 91 mg of aglycon equivalents of isoflavones and glycosides for three years does not reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer when compared with placebo in postmenopausal adults. However, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect small differences in the low rates of endometrial hyperplasia (90971).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral soy reduces fibromyalgia symptoms.\nClinical research shows that consuming a shake containing soy protein 20 grams and soy isoflavone 160 mg once daily for 6 weeks does not improve physical functioning or symptoms of depression in patients with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo (75451).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral soy reduces the risk for gastric cancer.\nMeta-analyses of population research have found that the highest intake of soy-containing foods and nonfermented soy products is associated with a 21% to 37% decreased risk of gastric cancer when compared with the lowest intake (95998, 108246). Intake of at least 100 grams daily of nonfermented soy foods was found to be the most protective (95998). However, a high intake of fermented soy products is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, and intake of 1-5 cups daily of the fermented soy product miso soup is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in males (95998, 108246).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial for hepatitis C.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hepatitis C shows that taking soy protein 32 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces the number of cases of steatosis by 47% and reduces alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels by 13% when compared to baseline. However, it is no different than taking casein protein (90970).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A small study suggests that oral soy isoflavones might reduce IBS symptoms.\nA small clinical study in females with IBS shows that taking soy isoflavones 40 mg daily for 6 weeks improves symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal distention and abdominal pain severity and duration, by approximately 27% when compared with placebo. Quality of life is also improved. Some symptoms are also improved when soy isoflavones are taken in combination with vitamin D; however, the combination of soy isoflavones and vitamin D does not seem to improve symptoms better than soy isoflavones alone (96425).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if dietary soy reduces the risk for lung cancer.\nA meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that although increased soy intake is not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer overall, it is associated with a slightly reduced risk in nonsmoking adults (90985).\nless\nMastalgia. It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial for mastalgia.\nA small clinical study suggests that soy milk providing 34 grams soy protein daily might reduce cyclical breast pain when compared with no intervention (2428).\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral soy has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of soy isoflavones 60 mg, dong quai 100 mg, and black cohosh 50 mg daily for 24 weeks reduces the frequency of menstrual-associated migraine attacks when compared with placebo (35797). It is not clear if this effect is due to soy, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral soy reduces the risk of neonatal jaundice.\nClinical research shows that patients with gestational diabetes who consume a diet containing soy protein along with other plant and animal proteins for 6 weeks beginning at 24-28 weeks' gestation have a 73% reduced risk for newborn hyperbilirubinemia when compared with those consuming a control diet containing only non-soy plant and animal proteins (95993).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of NAFLD.\nObservational research in a Chinese population has found that increased frequency of dietary soy consumption is associated with a lower incidence of NAFLD when compared with lower consumption (105612). A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials in patients living in Iran with NAFLD shows that consuming soy milk, soy foods, or a genistein supplement for 8 weeks might reduce some liver transaminase levels when compared with control (105611). Another meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with NAFLD shows that consuming soy milk, soy foods, or a genistein supplement for 8 or 24 weeks modestly improves insulin resistance but does not improve body mass index, cholesterol levels, or liver transaminase levels (108239). These analyses are limited by their generally small population size and the heterogeneity of interventions.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if consuming oral soy protein as part of a calorie-restricted diet improves weight loss; research is conflicting.\nSome clinical research shows that consuming soy protein in conjunction with calorie restriction for 2-6 months helps reduce weight in those who are obese and overweight when compared with calorie restriction alone (11085, 75397). Other clinical research shows that consuming soy protein for 16 weeks improves weight loss in overweight females when compared with consuming protein from meat (75620). Also, consuming black soy peptide 4.5 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight and body fat mass more than placebo in overweight and obese adults (90961). In addition, some clinical evidence shows that eating biscuits supplemented with soy fiber 100 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight, body mass index (BMI), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared to control in overweight and obese patients (90960).\n\nHowever, contradictory evidence exists. Some clinical research shows that following a calorie-restricted diet and consuming soy-based meal replacements 3-5 times daily for 12-16 weeks, or eating soy protein-rich foods in place of animal protein for 2-12 weeks, does not improve weight loss in overweight or obese individuals when compared to a calorie-restricted diet alone (75277, 75372, 75376, 90968). Also, in overweight and obese females following a free-choice diet, soy protein 56 grams daily for 23 weeks does not appear to improve weight loss when compared to eating an isoenergetic amount of carbohydrates (86077). Finally, a subgroup analysis of six preliminary clinical trials shows that soy products do not improve weight loss in postmenopausal adults (98870). The reason for these disparate findings is unclear but may be due to differences in the soy products used or differences in patient population. For example, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that phytoestrogen consumption reduces weight in healthy postmenopausal adults but not in those with comorbid conditions (98870). However, the clinical validity of this analysis is limited because it did not evaluate the effect of soy-only phytoestrogens.\n\nSoy protein has also been compared with whey protein. One small clinical study in overweight and obese adults shows that patients taking soy protein isolate 52 grams for 23 weeks had similar overall weight and fat loss as those taking whey protein concentrate 52 grams daily (86077). In contrast, another small clinical study in overweight males shows that taking soy isolate 60 grams before lunch daily for 12 weeks is less effective for weight loss when compared with taking whey protein concentrate 65 grams (91801).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral soy protein reduces osteoarthritis pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking soy protein 40 grams daily for three months improves range of motion, pain, and quality of life in osteoarthritis patients, particularly males, when compared to baseline. However, these beneficial effects seem to also be observed following supplementation with milk-based protein, indicating that the benefits may have resulted from a placebo effect (75266).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if dietary soy reduces overall mortality; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of observational studies has found that the highest intake of soy products is not associated with a lower risk of overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, or mortality from cancer when compared with the lowest intake (96941). However, a more recent population study has found that consuming at least 60 grams of soy daily over a 12-month period is associated with a 17% reduced risk of overall mortality over the next 5 years when compared with consuming less than 15 grams daily (108253). Also, an observational study in Japanese patients followed over 14.8 years has found that although overall soy intake is not associated with any benefit, increased intake of fermented soy products, such as natto and miso, was found to be associated with a slightly reduced risk of mortality (105600).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral soy reduces PCOS symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking soy isoflavones 50 mg daily for 12 weeks improves insulin levels and insulin resistance by a small amount when compared with placebo in patients with PCOS. Furthermore, taking soy isoflavones improves the free androgen index by approximately 25% and triglyceride levels by 14% when compared to baseline. However, taking soy isoflavones does not improve low- or high-density lipoprotein (LDL or HDL) cholesterol levels or markers of inflammation (95994).\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial for postmenopausal conditions.\nA meta-analysis of generally small clinical trials in postmenopausal adults shows that taking soy protein with isoflavones or soy isoflavones, usually for 3-24 months, has modest beneficial effects on total cholesterol, and possibly high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with milk protein, soy protein without isoflavones, or placebo. However, there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Subgroup analyses show that reductions in LDL cholesterol levels occur when soy is used for less than 6 months, in individuals older than 55 years, and when the soy protein contains isoflavones (108249).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral soy reduces PMS symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with PMS shows that taking isolated soy protein containing soy isoflavones 68 mg daily for two menstrual cycles reduces cramps and swelling when compared with placebo (75279).\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if oral soy reduces the risk for preterm labor.\nClinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that consuming a diet containing soy protein along with other plant and animal proteins for 6 weeks, beginning at 24-28 weeks' gestation, does not reduce the likelihood for caesarean section, preterm delivery, or maternal hospitalization when compared with a control diet containing only non-soy plant and animal proteins (95993).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral soy is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of prostate cancer; research is conflicting.\nObservational and clinical research has evaluated the effects of soy intake on prostate cancer risk. Observational research has found that consuming an Asian diet, which contains 10 times more soy than the average American diet, is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer; however, it is unclear whether it is the soy content of the diet or if genetic differences or environmental factors such as fat ingestion are responsible for this correlation (2298, 12884, 12886, 12887). A meta-analysis of observational trials from North America, Europe, and Asia has found that highest intake of total soy foods, unfermented soy foods, or soy isoflavones is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer when compared with the lowest intakes. However, higher intake of fermented soy foods is not associated with a reduced risk (96939). Furthermore, some observational research in Japanese males has found a weak association between increased prostate cancer mortality and a higher dietary intake of soy isoflavones when compared with a lower intake (105607). Research evaluating the use of soy supplements is also conflicting. One clinical study shows that taking soy protein 40 grams daily for 6 months reduces the development of prostate cancer six-fold in those at risk of prostate cancer when compared with milk protein (75432). However, another clinical study in healthy adults aged 50-80 years shows that taking soy protein, providing 83 mg isoflavones, daily for a year does not affect PSA levels when compared with a soy protein drink without isoflavones (12888).\n\nSoy products have also been evaluated in patients with prostate cancer. One clinical study shows that consuming a specific bread containing 50 grams of soy, providing 117 mg isoflavones, reduces PSA levels after about 3 weeks of treatment when compared with control (13140). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with rising PSA levels following prior therapy for prostate cancer shows that consuming 8 ounces of soy milk, standardized to contain 47 mg isoflavones, three times daily for 12 months slows the increase in PSA levels from 56% to 20% when compared with baseline (75435). However, one clinical study shows that taking soy protein 40 grams daily for 6 months does not reduce prostate size or improve PSA levels in those diagnosed with prostate cancer when compared with milk protein (75432). Also, in those with early stage prostate cancer, consuming a soy beverage daily providing genistein 60 mg does not seem to affect risk factors for progression of prostate cancer, including testosterone, estradiol, PSA, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels (11033). Furthermore, consuming soy protein isolate 20 grams standardized to contain approximately 70 mg isoflavones daily for two years does not prevent prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy when compared with placebo (90953). Reasons for the discrepancies are not entirely clear, but may include the relatively short trial durations (up to 12 months) and heterogeneity of soy preparations and dosing regimens.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral soy reduces RA symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with RA shows that consuming a liquid diet containing hydrolyzed soy protein (Top Up) daily for 4 weeks does not improve pain intensity, morning stiffness, or joint swelling and tenderness when compared to consuming a normal daily diet (75619).\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral soy reduces age-related muscle loss; evidence is conflicting.\nSome clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that consuming soy protein containing isoflavones 99 mg daily for 12 months does not improve hand grip strength or physical performance when compared with a milk protein placebo (75283). However, another small clinical study in older adults with low muscle mass living in China shows that taking soy, or a whey-soy blended protein, 16 grams daily for 6 months, slightly attenuates muscle loss when compared with no intervention (105603).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral soy improves outcomes and overall function in people who have had a stroke.\nOne small clinical study shows that older adults with a history of stroke who consumed soy milk 500 mL daily while participating in a rehabilitation program had greater improvements in hand grip strength, 8-feet walking speed, walking performance, and 6-minute walk test after 8 weeks when compared with placebo. However, consuming soy milk did not lead to greater improvements in lean mass or overall short physical performance battery (SPPB) scores when compared with placebo (100321).\nless\nThyroid cancer. It is unclear if dietary soy reduces the risk for thyroid cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that high dietary intake of soy is associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer when compared with lower intake (7662, 12041).\nless\nVaginal atrophy. It is unclear if topical soy improves vaginal atrophy.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with vaginal atrophy shows that applying one gram of soy extract 4% vaginal gel daily for 12 weeks reduces vaginal dryness and pain during sexual intercourse and improves vaginal endometrial thickness when compared with placebo (90964).\nless\nWrinkled skin. Small studies suggest that oral and topical soy might reduce wrinkles.\nA small clinical study in middle-aged females shows that consuming soy isoflavone 40 mg daily for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity and the appearance of fine wrinkles when compared with placebo (75388). Another small clinical study in females with photodamaged skin shows that applying a soy moisturizer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor and Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer, Johnson & Johnson CCI) twice daily for 12 weeks improves skin pigmentation, fine lines, texture, tone, and appearance when compared with a placebo moisturizer (75410).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate soy for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSoy foods are available in many forms such as tofu, miso, and soy milk. Soy protein is most commonly used in daily doses of up to 40 grams for up to 6 months. Daily doses as high as 60 grams have been used for up to 4 months. Soy isoflavones up to 120 mg daily have been used for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nSoy products may be standardized to specific soy isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein (96425),\nTopical:\nSoy has been used in various topical formulations including as a gel and a moisturizer. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSoy foods contain variable amounts of isoflavones. The typical amount of soy isoflavones per gram of soy product is as follows: soy flour, 2.6 mg; fermented soybeans, 1.3 mg; boiled soybeans, 0.6 mg; soy milk, 0.4 mg; soybean curd, 0.5 mg; fried soybean curd, 0.7 mg; soybean paste; 0.4 mg, and soy sauce, 0.016 mg (7342).\n\nOne study investigating the amount of isoflavones in soy products found that only 1 of 15 products contained isoflavones in the amount labeled by the manufacturer, with most products containing a lower amount (90974). Another study found that less than 25% of commercially available products contain within 90% of labeled soy isoflavone content. Higher prices did not correlate with higher quality products (11088).\n\nTouchi is a traditional Chinese soy product that is prepared by steaming then fermenting soybeans with koji (75205).\n\nClinical trials have used sources of soy isoflavones. Mixed isoflavones have contained 50% daidzein, 42.5% genistein, and 7.5% glycetin (96425); 75% genistein, 20% daidzein, and 5% glycitein (95994); or 46% daidzein, 42% genistein, and 2% glycitein (Novasoy, Archer Daniels Midland Co.)

Also, individuals following a soy-based meal replacement plan seem to require lower doses of sulfonylureas and metformin to manage blood glucose levels when compared with individuals following a diet plan recommended by the American Diabetes Association (75268).\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review))\nTheoretically soy protein may have additive effects with antihypertensive drugs and increase the risk of hypotension.\nAlthough some contradictory research exists (14254), most clinical evidence suggests that consuming soy protein modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension (13139, 75482).\nless\nCAFFEINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, soy might reduce the clearance of caffeine.\nSoy contains genistein. Taking genistein 1 gram daily for 14 days seems to inhibit caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy females (23582). This effect has been attributed to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism. It is unclear if this effect occurs with the lower amounts of genistein found in soy.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nSoy might modestly induce CYP2C9 enzymes. However, this effect does not seem to be clinically significant.\nIn vitro research suggests that an unhydrolyzed soy extract might induce CYP2C9. However, the significance of this interaction is likely minimal. In healthy females taking a specific extract of soy (Genistein Soy Complex, Source Naturals), blood levels of losartan, a CYP2C9 substrate, were not significantly affected (16825).\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, soy might have additive effects when used with diuretic drugs.\nAnimal research suggests that genistein, a soy isoflavone, increases diuresis within 6 hours of subcutaneous administration in rats. The effects seem to be similar to those of furosemide (75604). This effect has not been reported in humans.\nless\nESTROGENS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, soy might competitively inhibit the effects of estrogen replacement therapy.\nSoy contains phytoestrogens and has been shown to have estrogenic activity in some patients (3860). Although this has not been demonstrated in humans, theoretically, concomitant use of soy with estrogen replacement therapy might reduce the effects of the estrogen replacement therapy.\nless\nLEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nSoy products might reduce the absorption of levothyroxine in some patients.\nPreliminary clinical research and a case report suggest that soy-based formulas inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism (20636, 20637, 75548, 90959). A levothyroxine dosage increase may be needed for infants with congenital hypothyroidism while using soy-based formulas, and the dose may need to be reduced when soy-based formulas are no longer administered. However, in postmenopausal adults, clinical research shows that taking a single dose of soy extract containing isoflavones 60 mg along with levothyroxine does not affect the oral bioavailability of levothyroxine (95996).\nless\nMONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nC (Expert opinion)\nTaking soy products containing high amounts of tyramine along with MAOIs can increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.\nFermented soy products such as tofu and soy sauce contain tyramine, a naturally occurring chemical that affects blood pressure regulation. The metabolism of tyramine is decreased by MAOIs. Consuming more than 6 mg of tyramine while taking an MAOI can increase the risk of hypertensive crisis (15649). The amount of tyramine in fermented soy products is usually less than 0.6 mg per serving; however, there can be significant variation depending on the specific product used, storage conditions, and length of storage. Storing one brand of tofu for a week can increase tyramine content from 0.23 mg to 4.8 mg per serving (15649, 15701, 15702).

A relatively low in vitro concentration of soy isoflavones such as 1 microM/L seems to interfere with tamoxifen, whereas high in vitro concentrations such as those >10 microM/L might actually enhance tamoxifen effects. People on a high-soy diet have soy isoflavones levels ranging from 0.1-6 microM/L.

This effect has been attributed to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism. It is unclear if this effect occurs with the lower amounts of genistein found in soy. See caffeine-containing ingredients here.\nless\nGREEN TEA\nTheoretically, soy protein may reduce the benefits of green tea when consumed concomitantly.\nClinical evidence in healthy females shows that consuming a drink containing green tea extract in combination with soy protein reduces the bioavailability of total catechins, epigallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate from green tea. Advise patients to separate dosing of green tea and soy protein products by at least three hours (90957).\nless\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nSoy might have hypoglycemic effects.\nClinical research suggests that whole soy diets and soy-based meals reduce fasting glucose levels in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, including those taking antidiabetes medications (75268, 75296, 75378, 75493, 96001). Soy products might have additive effects and side effects when used with other supplements that decrease blood glucose levels.

Other clinical research suggests that various fermented soy products and dephytinized soy formula increase iron bioavailability in adults and infants when compared to control (20639, 75564). However, some conflicting evidence suggests that soy protein isolate reduces the absorption of non-heme iron from foods (5053). These differing effects are likely due to the presence of phytic acid. This constituent inhibits iron absorption, but its concentration is reduced after fermentation.\nless\nMANGANESE\nSoy might reduce manganese absorption from food.\nClinical evidence suggests that soy formula reduces the bioavailability of manganese when compared with human milk or cow's milk. This effect has been attributed to the ability of phytic acid, a constituent of some soy products, to chelate elements such as manganese and reduce their absorption (61534).\nless\nZINC\nSoy might reduce zinc absorption from food.\nClinical evidence suggests that administering soy-based formula to infants for 4 months reduces plasma zinc levels when compared with breastfeeding (20641).

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBREAST CANCER\nThe effects of soy in patients with breast cancer are unclear. Soy isoflavones have weak estrogenic effects, which has led to concerns about the use of soy in patients with breast cancer. There is evidence that soy might increase breast cell proliferation in healthy females (3980, 3981). However, in a 2-week study of soy isoflavones 200 mg/day in patients with breast cancer, soy isoflavones did not seem to stimulate breast cancer cell growth (11042). Also, taking a soy tablet containing 50 mg soy isoflavones daily for 12 months did not alter mammographic or breast MRI tissue density in females at high risk of breast cancer, with non-endocrine treated breast cancer, or previously treated for breast cancer and without evidence of recurrence (95999).\nless\nCROSS-ALLERGENICITY\nSoy might cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the Fabaceae family.

There is some evidence that soy might inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and increase thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in infants with congenital hypothyroidism or in postmenopausal adults (7806, 20637). There are also cases of hypothyroidism and goiter in infants fed soy formula (6466). However, this seems to occur primarily in people with low iodine levels (6466). In postmenopausal adults with normal levels of iodine, taking a soy extract for 6 months does not seem to significantly affect thyroid hormone levels (13010, 90973).\nless\nKIDNEY FAILURE\nTheoretically, patients with kidney failure could be more sensitive to the phytoestrogens in soy. In patients with kidney failure, phytoestrogens in soy may reach higher plasma concentrations, increasing the risk for toxicity (8522).\nless\nKIDNEY STONES (Nephrolithiasis)\nThere is some concern that soy products might increase the risk of kidney stones due to high oxalate content. Soy products can contain from 0.02-42 mg oxalate/gram or approximately 2-640 mg/serving of soy, depending on the soy food type (7073, 11079).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with soy.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn the gastrointestinal tract, the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein are hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases in the jejunum, releasing the isoflavone aglycone forms of genistein and daidzein (3982, 5937, 9346). Genistein and daidzein are absorbed from the human gut, although about 85% of soy isoflavones are degraded in the intestines following ingestion (75574, 75585). Daidzein is further metabolized by gut flora in some people to the estrogenic compound, equol, which is also absorbed (12049). The absorption of isoflavones from food may be saturable, suggesting improved effect if ingested throughout the day, but there is considerable variation in absorption from person to person (3380, 3982, 7344). In general, healthy intestinal flora appears to be important for proper absorption of soy (75549). Also, there is some variation in how isoflavones are absorbed from different soy products. Soy germ products result in higher plasma levels of daidzein and lower levels of genistein. Soy protein products result in higher levels of genistein. Soy foods such as tofu produce less dramatic rises of daidzein and genistein. Genistein from soy food sources appears to be more bioavailable than daidzein (7330). Isoflavone bioavailability is similar for most soy foods (4750). However, fermented soy contains a more easily absorbed form of isoflavones than those found in nonfermented products (75606).\nDistribution\nGenistein and daidzein are widely distributed in the body and undergo enterohepatic recycling (7330, 75585). Peak concentrations appear at 4-8 hours after dietary intake, and excretion is within 24 hours (3982). They are found both free in serum and bound to plasma proteins. Both genistein and daidzein are conjugated to sulfate and glucuronide compounds. In plasma, 48% of genistein and 33% of daidzein are present as a glucuronide and 8% of genistein and 26% of daidzein are present as a sulfate (9673).\nMetabolism\nIsoflavonoid glycosides from soy are converted to hormone-like compounds by intestinal bacteria (75558). The elimination half-life of free genistein and free daidzein are 3.2 and 4.2 hours, respectively. The elimination half-life of total genistein and total daidzein are 9.2 and 8.2 hours, respectively (7661). The half-lives of genistein glucuronide and daidzein glucuronide are 3.2 and 8.4 hours, respectively. The half-lives of genistein sulfate and daidzein sulfate are 3.1 and 5.7 hours, respectively (9673).\nExcretion\nSoy isoflavones, including equol, O-desmethylangolensin, daidzein, and genistein, are primarily excreted in the urine (75314, 75546). Only 1% to 2% of ingested isoflavones undergo fecal excretion (75574). Approximately 10% of consumed daidzein is excreted in the urine as its equol conjugate (75678). However, many patients are unable to biotransform daidzein to equol, so higher levels of daidzein and genistein may be seen in the urine (75629).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of soy is the bean. Soybeans are legumes that contain up to 50% protein; 24% carbohydrates; and 25% oil including stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. The active constituents of soybeans are the phytoestrogens, known as isoflavones and lignans (3387, 3978, 4753, 6029, 11041), and phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (8528). Lignans are commonly found in grains but are also found in legumes such as soy. Soy lignans include syringaresinol, secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, and others (11041). Soy protein also contains phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, and various saponins (11040).\n\nSoybeans are also rich in calcium, iron, potassium, amino acids, vitamins, and fiber. Soy protein contains all of the essential amino acids in sufficient quantities to support human life (2426). Non-fortified soy beverages such as soy milk contain only about 10 mg of calcium per serving (6414). Most soy milk products are fortified with calcium carbonate, which has an equivalent bioavailability to the calcium from cow's milk (11078). Tricalcium phosphate-fortified soy milk can contain from 80-500 mg of calcium per serving, but has a poor calcium bioavailability compared to cow's milk (6414, 11078). Fermented soy foods, such as soy sauce, miso, tempeh, and natto, may have higher amounts of calcium and vitamin K2 (7342).\n\nFermented soy products such as tofu and soy sauce contain tyramine. The amount of tyramine in these products is usually relatively small, often less than 0.6 mg per serving; however, there can be significant variation depending on the specific product, storage conditions, and length of storage. For example, storing one brand of tofu for a week can increase tyramine content from 0.23 mg to 4.8 mg per serving (15649, 15701, 15702).\n\nSoybeans and soy foods are the most significant dietary source of isoflavones (3387, 3978, 4753, 6029). They contain the isoflavone glucosides genistein and daidzein in their inactive conjugated forms. In the gastrointestinal tract, genistein and daidzein are hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases in the jejunum, releasing the isoflavone aglycone forms of genistein and daidzein (3982, 5937, 9346). Daidzein is further metabolized by gut flora to the estrogenic compound, equol. The extent of conversion of daidzein to equol varies among people due to differences in gut flora. Theoretically, people who do not convert significant amounts of daidzein to equol (\"non-equol producers\") might not experience the same pharmacological effects as people who do convert significant amounts (\"equol producers\"). However the ability to produce equol does not always determine the clinical benefits of soy (12049, 95995). About 50% of the population does not produce equol (4952). To overcome this, some people are trying probiotics to attempt to increase isoflavone levels. But using probiotics in combination with soy supplements does not seem to increase plasma phytoestrogen levels or increase the conversion of isoflavones to equol (11037). The amount of isoflavones varies among the forms of soy. Soy milk and soy powder have a lower concentration of isoflavones than other soy products (7655). Soy protein usually contains 1-3 mg of isoflavones per gram of protein (7333).\n\nSoy isoflavones are heterocyclic phenols with structural similarity to estradiol and selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs). Soy isoflavones bind to both the alpha- and beta-estrogen receptors. But they have a higher affinity for the beta-estrogen receptor (3983, 3992, 6029, 7344, 7657).\n\nThe beta-estrogen receptor predominates in the heart, vasculature, bone, and bladder; and may account for some of soy's beneficial effects. Actions at the cellular level depend on the target tissue, receptor status of the tissue, and the level of endogenous estrogen (7344).\nAntiasthma effects\nSome evidence suggests that dietary soy is associated with reduced asthma severity. Preliminary evidence suggests that genistein, a soy isoflavone, decreases eosinophil leukotriene C(4) synthesis by 33% in asthma patients (75413). Leukotriene C(4) plays a role in bronchoconstriction.\nAnticancer effects\nIn cancer, soy is thought to be beneficial due to preliminary evidence that suggests soy isoflavones have antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic activity (2296, 3983). Soy also contains other anticarcinogenic compounds such as saponins, phytates, protease inhibitors, and phytosterols (9346).\n\nThere is a lot of controversy about soy's potential role in breast cancer. Some researchers think that soy is protective against breast cancer. Asian females who eat a traditional diet high in soy seem to have a lower risk of developing of breast cancer (4590, 5939). This benefit persists even when Asian females immigrate to the western cultures where soy is less likely to be a regular component of the diet (9674). This suggests that exposure to soy early in life (i.e., before menopause), provides the most benefit against breast cancer. It is theorized that isoflavones found in soy enhance early cellular differentiation and maturation of mammary glands. More mature mammary glands seem to be less susceptible to carcinogens (4590). Animal models show that soy protein can prevent chemically induced breast cancer (3976). There is also some evidence that genistein can suppress breast cancer cell growth by arresting the cell cycle and stimulating apoptosis (3378, 11035, 75617). Additional research suggests that soy isoflavones might inhibit angiogenesis (11035). Other research suggests that genistein influences enzymes involved in signal transduction that regulate cell growth and replication (7337, 75201). Genistein seems to exert multiple antiproliferative effects on both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) as well as estrogen receptor negative (ER-) human breast cancer cells (9346, 10461). The ability of genistein to inhibit the growth of precancerous dysplastic cells in breast tissue might contribute to the prevention of breast cancer (8965). Also, genistein appears to decrease levels of 17beta-estradiol, an ovarian steroid involved in transformation and tumorigenesis in human breast epithelial cells (75581).\n\nThere is also some evidence that soy isoflavones can prolong the menstrual cycle and suppress midcycle surges of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which may also decrease the risk of breast cancer (9346, 11035). Other research suggests that soy isoflavones do not significantly increase plasma levels of estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in premenopausal and postmenopausal individuals (11086, 11087, 12571).\n\nSome research suggests that soy consumption alters the ratios of various estrogen metabolites in the urine, reducing excretion of potentially carcinogenic estrogen metabolites. This suggests that soy might cause a shift in estrogen metabolism to produce more benign metabolites (2430). However, some researchers suggest that due to the estrogenic effects of soy, it might actually increase the risk of breast cancer (6030). There is also preliminary in vitro data suggesting that soy can stimulate proliferation of normal human breast tissue (3980, 3981). However, taking a soy tablet containing 50 mg soy isoflavones daily for 12 months does not alter mammographic or breast MRI tissue density in females at high risk of breast cancer, with non-endocrine treated breast cancer, or previously treated for breast cancer and without evidence of recurrence (95999). Higher serum estradiol levels are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. There is evidence that drinking soy milk daily can reduce serum 17-beta-estradiol and progesterone levels in premenopausal patients. However, other research shows only a very modest effect of a high soy isoflavone diet on plasma hormones (2429, 7654, 9676).\n\n\"Unopposed estrogen\" from the estrogenic activity of soy and its effects on the uterus has been a concern. There doesn't seem to be any significant effects on vaginal cytology or endometrial biopsy in premenstrual or postmenopausal adults (2429, 7654, 9676, 9917). Dietary phytoestrogens are associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer. In addition to their effect on estrogen, isoflavones and other phytoestrogenic substances in soy might inhibit aromatase, which converts androstenedione to estrone, and may in turn increase endometrial cancer risk (7338, 10372). Also, some in vitro evidence shows that genistein can induce apoptosis in human uterine adenocarcinoma cell lines at the G2/M phase (75661).\n\nLaboratory research suggests that genistein decreases the growth of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer tissue (11238). Other preliminary research suggests that genistein might change androgen receptor expression and transcriptional activity of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (12885, 75221, 75399). In addition, genistein appears to reduce the secretion of prostaglandin E2 from prostate cells. Prostaglandin E2 is known to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer (75455). Genistein also appears to induce apoptosis of human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (75660).\nAntidiabetic effects\nFor diabetes, soy protein might reduce glucose levels due to its fiber content. There is also evidence that soy might improve glycemic control by inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity, improving insulin receptor affinity, improving glucose transport and increasing tissue sensitivity to insulin (8513). Touchi, a traditional Chinese food used as a seasoning agent, is prepared by steaming and then fermenting soybeans with the fungus Aspergillus. Touchi extract might be beneficial for diabetes patients because it seems to inhibit intestinal alpha-glucosidase and lower postprandial glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. It may also lower triglyceride levels (11762).\nBone effects\nFor preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis, soy is thought to work due to its weak estrogenic effects on bone (5598, 6029). Like estrogen, soy seems to have the most effect on the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (7660). Soy seems to increase serum levels of osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation, in postmenopausal adults (7659). The soy isoflavone genistein appears to directly inhibit osteoclast activity (9346). High intake of soy also seems to lower parathyroid hormone levels, which might lower bone turnover (7660). In vitro tests suggest that genistein may promote the proliferation of osteoblasts by inhibiting oxidative damage (9682). Although some research suggests that soy protein and isoflavones do not seem to influence calcium absorption in postmenopausal adults, the evidence is mixed with respect to calcium retention (7343, 11083, 95995).\nCardiovascular effects\nSoy has several pharmacological effects that might be beneficial for preventing cardiovascular disease (6029). It may lower homocysteine levels by unknown mechanisms, possibly related to the folic acid found in soy protein. Soy may also inhibit platelet aggregation (3992, 8530, 9776, 75288, 75295, 75357). Soy might increase bile acid excretion, up-regulate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, inhibit endogenous cholesterol synthesis (2426, 2594, 6029, 6030, 7344, 17106, 75295, 75667). Phytosterols in soy also contribute to the lowering of LDL cholesterol by competitively inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the small bowel (2594, 8528).\n\nSome preliminary evidence suggests that soy might prevent progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis (7333). The isoflavones found in soy, particularly genistein, inhibit oxidation of LDL particles, a process thought to play a role in early atherosclerosis (2586, 6029, 7347, 9560, 9561). The isoflavones seem to inhibit LDL oxidation by acting as free radical scavengers and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) (9683). In addition to preventing LDL oxidation, genistein also seems to protect vascular cells from oxidized LDL (8527). Some evidence suggests that genistein may prevent vascular remodeling, which is an important component of atherosclerotic plaque formation (8503). Genistein might produce these effects by inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity, and reducing the production of proteolytic enzymes and the migration of endothelial cells (9346). Genistein also appears to lower levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein that plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis (75440). Soy also seems to improve arterial compliance in perimenopausal females (851).\n\nUnlike oral estrogen, phytoestrogens don't seem to elevate C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (9919), furthermore, some clinical research suggests that soy supplements might slightly lower CRP levels (105597, 108250). However, lipoprotein (a), which has been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, does not seem to be affected by soy in postmenopausal adults. In males, most research suggests that soy doesn't negatively affect lipoprotein (a) (7347, 8530, 8963, 8964). The effect of soy on endothelial function, an early marker of vascular disease, is variable. In middle-aged males, soy might improve endothelial function. However, soy does not seem to affect endothelial function in postmenopausal adults and might worsen endothelial function in older males (8963, 8964, 14820, 105596).\n\nSoy seems to lower blood pressure, in particular the diastolic pressure (9346). Some clinical evidence shows that soybean powder can reduce diastolic blood pressure by increasing levels of adiponectin and nitric oxide (90975). Adiponectin stimulates the production of nitric oxide, which is involved in regulating blood pressure (90976).\nCoagulant effects\nDue to the estrogenic effects of soy isoflavones, there is some concern that soy might have pro-coagulant effects and potentially increase the risk for blood clots, similar to estrogen. But clinical evidence suggests that soy isoflavones have no significant effect on markers of coagulation, such as factor VII, or fibrinolysis (13168).\nDental effects\nPreliminary clinical evidence shows that soy-based formula reduces plaque pH compared with other formulas (75582). By reducing plaque pH, soy formula may increase the development of tooth decay in infants.\nDiuretic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that the soy isoflavone genistein can inhibit Na-K-Cl cotransporters similarly to the loop diuretic furosemide (75604).\nDrug metabolizing effects\nThere is some evidence that isoflavones can inhibit oxidative and conjugative metabolism of drugs (4736). Isoflavones might also affect drug absorption and biliary excretion by interacting with drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein and the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (4736). Given the wide range of drugs and metabolites whose pharmacokinetics depends on these mechanisms, drug interactions with isoflavones might be more common than literature reports suggest.\nGastrointestinal effects\nReduction in duration of diarrhea in children fed soy formula may result from enhancement of sodium and water absorption by digested soy glucose and amino acids in the gut (75474).\nHormonal effects\nSoy phytoestrogens might act as SERMs (3387, 3990). In premenopausal adults with normal endogenous estrogen levels, soy phytoestrogens may have an anti-estrogen effect since soy isoflavones might displace endogenous estrogen from receptors. Consuming soy protein might also lower circulating levels of estradiol in premenopausal adults over the entire menstrual cycle (7663, 7805, 75226). In postmenopausal adults with low endogenous estrogens, soy phytoestrogens have a weak estrogenic effect (3373, 3988, 3989, 3990, 3994, 6029, 8529). Estrogenic effects of soy have also been attributed to benefit menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. Genistein seems to relieve hot flashes in some females (11994). However, some research suggests that the incidence of hot flashes does not seem to correlate with serum levels of the phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and equol. Other components of soy, in addition to phytoestrogens, may be responsible for reduction in hot flashes (4752).\n\nThe soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, seem to be responsible for the effects on thyroid hormones. These isoflavones seem to block production of thyroid hormone by interfering with thyroid peroxidase catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin. This can result in increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and goiter. However, these clinical results appear most likely to occur in people with low iodine levels (6466). The effect on thyroid function is not likely to be clinically significant in patients with adequate dietary iodine intake (7806).\n\nThe soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, seem to be responsible for the effects on thyroid hormones.

The effect on thyroid function is not likely to be clinically significant in patients with adequate dietary iodine intake (7806).\nNeurological effects\nSoy isoflavones have potential benefits on cognitive function. Preliminary evidence suggests that the effects of soy isoflavones seem to be equivalent to those of 17 beta-estradiol in up-regulating choline acetyl transferase and nerve growth factor. These chemical factors are thought to be essential for learning and memory. Soy also might decrease the phosphorylation of the brain protein tau. Phosphorylation of this protein is associated with the development of Alzheimer disease (9346).\nProstate effects\nIn prostate diseases, soy phytoestrogens are thought to be potentially beneficial due to estrogenic mechanisms as well as inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3984, 3985). A diet high in soy foods seems to reduce serum estradiol levels and testosterone levels, but not PSA levels in healthy volunteers (7339, 9683, 9777, 11039). However, in patients with prostate cancer consuming a soy beverage does not seem to decrease PSA or testosterone (11033).\n\nLaboratory research suggests that genistein decreases the growth of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer tissue (11238). Other preliminary research suggests that genistein might change androgen receptor expression and transcriptional activity of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (12885).\nProtection against heavy metal toxicity\nTofu, a soybean product, seems to inhibit the absorption of lead and prevent its build up in the body, possibly because of its phytic acid and calcium content (7656).\nWeight loss effects\nPostmenopausal adults with high dietary intake of the soy isoflavone genistein seem to have a lower body mass index, waist circumference, and fasting insulin levels than those with lower intake (7804). However, soy supplementation does not significantly increase concentrations of leptin, a protein associated with appetite and weight loss, in postmenopausal adults. In fact, some evidence suggests that soy supplementation can reduce leptin levels in patients who are obese or overweight (75428). But some evidence suggests that consumption of soy isoflavones as part of cereal bars increases levels of peptide YY, a satiety hormone (75340). In healthy female freshmen college students, consuming meal replacement shakes containing soy protein 20 grams and soy isoflavones 161 grams daily for 16 weeks did not prevent weight gain when compared with consuming casein-based meal replacements (90952)."

No adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials in adults eating foods enriched with soybean oil or taking supplements containing soybean oil unsaponifiable fractions (10693, 10694, 33238, 33257, 93110, 93111).

Applying soybean oil 2% (Bite Blocker, HOMS LLC) to the skin provides complete protection against mosquitoes for up to approximately 1.5 hours. This is comparable to products containing DEET 4.7%. However, higher concentrations of DEET have a significantly longer duration of action (13077). DEET 10% to 35% provides 4-12 hours of protection depending on the product formulation (13077, 13083).\nHealth Canada considers soybean oil to be an alternative to low concentration DEET for protection against mosquitoes with the caveat that soybean oil is considerably shorter-acting (13083, 93685).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypercholesterolemia. Clinical research suggests that consuming soybean oil has modest beneficial effects on levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with palm oil products. The effect on levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with normal and high cholesterol shows that adding 20 grams of a soybean oil-based mayonnaise to the diet daily for 2 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 10 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 7 mg/dL when compared with using palm olein-based mayonnaise. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is also decreased by 5 mg/dL (93684). In young, healthy adults without hyperlipidemia, a small clinical study shows that consuming soybean oil as 20% of total energy intake modestly reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with palm olein, with no effect on triglyceride or HDL cholesterol levels (108255). However, a small clinical trial in middle-aged and elderly females at increased cardiovascular risk shows that cooking food in soybean oil for 3 months does not improve levels of triglycerides or total or LDL cholesterol when compared with baseline or other oils including olive oil or camellia seed oil (108257).\nIn adults with moderately elevated LDL cholesterol, a small clinical trial evaluated the effects of consuming foods containing either high-oleic soybean oil (50:50 blend of Vistive Gold; Monsanto Company and Plenish; Pioneer) or a mixture of high-oleic soybean oil and fully hydrogenated soybean oil in an 80:20 ratio, providing about 17% of total daily energy intake, for 28 days. Both of these interventions reduce levels of total and LDL cholesterol by 9% to 11% when compared with a blend of palm oil and palm kernel oil. However, foods containing the soybean oil blend also reduced HDL cholesterol levels by 6%; this reduction did not occur with foods containing high-oleic soybean oil alone (108254).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer-related fatigue.

In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 tablespoons of soybean oil per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD. However, the FDA has concluded that this claim is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (102361). In addition, the FDA allows for a qualified health claim that using high-oleic acid soybean oil as a replacement for dietary fats and oils higher in saturated fat may reduce the risk of CHD. To achieve this benefit, high-oleic acid soybean oil should not increase total daily energy intake. The suggested daily dietary intake is about 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of high-oleic soybean oil in place of other fats and oils (98563).\nMore evidence is needed to rate soybean oil for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of spearmint are the leaf and oil. Spearmint oil contains 50% to 70% carvone, as well as rosmarinic acid, limonene, pinene, linalool, and related compounds (94924, 94925, 98522). Spearmint oil bred to be higher in rosmarinic acid contains undetectable levels of carvone and higher levels of myrcene, borneol, mintlactone, and gamma-elemene (94925, 98523).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSpearmint has shown anti-inflammatory effects in various animal models (59548, 75794). Spearmint essential oil and the constituent carvone have been shown to reduce the accumulation of white blood cells and the activity of inflammatory cytokines in laboratory research (59540, 59548). An extract of spearmint from a plant breed high in rosmarinic acid can inhibit the production of inflammatory eicosanoid mediators (94923).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSpearmint is traditionally used as an antiseptic. In vitro spearmint oil has shown antibacterial and antifungal activity against various species. Menthol and carvone are possible active constituents (31344, 47789, 68380, 68487, 75772, 75793, 98522).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSpearmint is traditionally used for cancer. Animal and in vitro research suggests that spearmint might reduce the proliferation of cancer cells by providing antioxidants (75707, 75741, 98522). In laboratory research, spearmint tea protects against the development or action of chemical carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines (75733).\nErgogenic effects\nThere is some interest in using spearmint to improve cognitive function during athletic activities to enhance athletic performance. Some research in recreationally active adults shows that taking spearmint extract may improve reactive agility, possibly through anti-inflammatory activity (101714). However, it is unclear from this study whether improvement in reactive agility enhances athletic performance.\nHepatotoxic effects\nAnimal research shows that drinking spearmint tea for 30 days can increase markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and can cause liver degeneration and necrosis; the effect appears to be dose-dependent (12731). These changes appear to be related to an induction of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in the liver (12731).\nHormonal effects\nSpearmint has shown hormonal effects in animal and human research. In females, spearmint tea reduced the level of free testosterone in the blood, without affecting the levels of total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (68451, 68500). In animal research, spearmint induces alterations in testicular gene expression and hormone production resulting in testicular anti-androgenicity, possibly by inducing oxidative stress in the hypothalamus (68478). In rats, spearmint tea also decreased the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in rats (12732). These hormone changes resulted in a decreased sperm density (68478). Although not confirmed, there have been anecdotal reports of reduced libido in men (68500).\nMemory effects\nSpearmint oil bred to be higher in polyphenols, such as rosmarinic acid, might modestly improve memory quality in older adults with cognitive decline. However, it does not seem to improve memory in healthy younger adults. In an animal model of senescence, the improvements in memory were related to antioxidant effects in the hippocampus (98523).\nNephrotoxic effects\nAnimal research shows that drinking spearmint tea for 30 days can increase markers of kidney damage, including levels of urea and creatinine, and can induce nephrotoxic changes in kidney tissue; the effect appears to be dose-dependent. These changes appear to be related to an induction of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in the kidney (68398).\nPulmonary effects\nSpearmint oil is used traditionally for inflammation of the respiratory tract.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral intake, iron and calcium in spinach are poorly absorbed (75820, 75853, 75856). Carotenoids in spinach are absorbed more readily when the spinach is consumed with fat or when the spinach is liquified (60089, 75824, 75826).\nExcretion\nOxalates from spinach are excreted in the urine (36547, 75865).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of spinach is the leaf. Spinach contains various nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, B vitamins, magnesium, nitrates, lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, folic acid, phenolics, and chlorophyll (18, 19, 11285, 96856, 96861, 106567). It also contains triterpene saponins and oxalic acid (18). Spinach is considered a valuable source of dietary fiber (106567).\nAntineoplastic effects\nConsumption of spinach has been linked with a decreased risk of various types of cancer, including stomach cancer (4112, 49651, 75830, 75838). Laboratory research suggests that spinach compounds have an antiproliferative effect on various types of cancer cells. In animal research, spinach can reduce tumor size (41770, 75806, 75823, 75834, 96861). The anti-cancer effects of spinach may be related to the antioxidant activity of the various constituents, including vitamins, polyphenols, and carotenoids. Antioxidant effects of spinach have been shown in laboratory, animal, and human research (49650, 60331, 75823, 96861).\nLiver effects\nIn animal research, adding a hydroalcoholic spinach extract 400 mg/kg twice daily for 7 weeks to a high-fat diet reduces the risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) when compared with the high-fat diet alone. Mechanisms include reduced food intake and weight gain, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) gene expression, and decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression in the liver (109547).\n\nIn animals with NAFLD induced by 7 weeks of a high-fat diet, giving the hydroalcoholic spinach extract 400 mg/kg twice daily for 4 weeks while continuing the high-fat diet lowers serum hs-CRP and PTX-3 levels, increases serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GPX) enzyme activity, and increases liver gene expression of PPAR-gamma and TNF-alpha, but does not reduce weight gain or food intake (109547).\nMuscle effects\nA spinach extract containing phytoecdysteroids, particularly 20-hydroxyecdysone, increases strength, muscle mass, and protein synthesis during resistance training. Doses above 5 mcg/kg body weight are required for these effects in animals (109546).\nNeurological/CNS effects\nLaboratory research suggests that compounds contained in spinach might slow the effects of aging on the nervous system (1418, 1419).\nWeight loss effects\nSpinach is of interest for weight loss (96856, 96857). Research in animals shows that thylakoids, constituents of spinach chloroplast membranes, delay fat digestion by inhibiting pancreatic lipase and colipase, which increases circulating levels of satiety hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK). Thylakoid intake also decreases fat accumulation in the liver by increasing gene expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) in adipose tissue (109547). Also, preliminary clinical research suggests that a product containing spinach has a small effect on weight loss, hunger, and satiety in overweight and obese females (96853, 96854, 96856). This may be related to the increased levels of CCK and release of glucagon-like peptide 1, both of which modulate hunger and satiety (96853, 96856, 109547). However, spinach does not seem to reduce food intake at the next meal (96854, 96855). In obese males, taking a thylakoid-rich spinach extract for 12 weeks while undergoing an exercise program reduces obesity-related inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction by increasing activity of the Kruppel-like factor 15 and C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 12 pathways in adipose tissue, and decreasing levels of pro-inflammatory furin (115751)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of squill.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of squill is the bulb. Squill contains cardioactive glycosides, including bufadienolides, scillaren A, glucoscillaren A, and proscillaridin A (4, 6, 18, 3488, 76039). Squill bulb extract also contains squalene, decane, 4-methyl decane, tetramethyl pyrazine, ethyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, ethyl linolelaidate, ethyl oleate, betaxolol, heptacosane, nonacosane, cholesterol formate, and beta-sitosterol (104984).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research in rats shows that taking squill bulb extract 1.5 grams/kg once orally reduces chemically-induced paw and ear edema when compared with control. Additional research in rats with chemically-induced arthritis shows that taking squill bulb extract 1.5 grams/kg daily for 15 days reduces the signs of arthritic development such as pannus formation, bone erosion, and inflammatory cell infiltration in joints when compared with control (104984).\nCardiac effects\nSquill seems to have cardiac effects similar to digoxin, including positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects (4, 7, 3488). Squill has additional cardiovascular properties that include reducing left ventricular diastolic pressure, and reducing pathologically elevated venous pressure (18, 76038).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe aglycones in squill are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are therefore less potent than digitalis cardiac glycosides. Large amounts of squill can induce vomiting due to gastric irritation and central action (4).\nHematologic effects\nTAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced arthritis shows that taking squill bulb extract 1.5 grams/kg daily for 15 days increases hemoglobin and red blood cell levels and reduces white blood cell and platelet levels when compared with control (104984).\nRespiratory effects\nIn small doses, squill is reported to cause an expectorant-like effect (6)."

    "St. John's Wort": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "St. John's wort is a plant native to Europe with yellow, star-shaped flowers. St. John's wort is named after John the Baptist because the plant generally begins to flower around the 24th of June, the feast day of St. John the Baptist (11804).",
            "Warnings": "St. John's wort has been associated with potentially serious interactions with certain drugs. Because of this, France has banned the use of St. John's wort products. Several other countries require drug-herb interaction cautionary language on St. John's wort products (4892).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. St. John's wort extracts in doses up to 900 mg daily seem to be safe when used for up to 12 weeks (3547, 3550, 4835, 5096, 6400, 6434, 7047, 13021, 13156, 13157)(14417, 76143, 76144, 89666, 89669, 95510). Some evidence also shows that St. John's wort can be safely used for over one year (13156, 13157, 76140), and may have better tolerability than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (4897, 76153, 76143, 104036).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used topically and appropriately. St. John's wort 0.5% extract seems to be safe when used once weekly for 4 weeks (110327). St. John's wort oil has been used with apparent safely twice daily for 6 weeks (110326). However, topical use of St. John's wort can cause photodermatitis with sun exposure (110318).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large doses. St. John's wort extract can be unsafe due to the risk of severe phototoxic skin reactions. Taking 2-4 grams of St. John's wort extract (containing hypericin 5-10 mg) daily appears to increase the risk of photosensitivity (758, 4631, 7808).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, and appropriately, short-term. St. John's wort extracts in doses up to 300 mg three times daily seem to be safe when used for up to 8 weeks in children aged 6-17 years (4538, 17986, 76110).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Preliminary population research has found that taking St. John's wort while pregnant is associated with offspring that develop neural tube, urinary, and cardiovascular malformations. Subgroup analyses suggest that these risks may be higher when taking St. John's wort during the first trimester when compared with the second or third trimester. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings (106052). Animal-model research also shows that constituents of St. John's wort might have teratogenic effects (9687, 15122). Until more is known, St. John's wort should not be taken during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Nursing infants of mothers who take St. John's wort have a greater chance of experiencing colic, drowsiness, and lethargy (1377, 15122, 22418); avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, St. John's wort is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, gastrointestinal discomfort (mild), fatigue, headache, insomnia, restlessness, and sedation.\n\nTopically: Skin rash and photodermatitis.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been rare case reports of suicidal ideation and psychosis after taking St. John's wort.\nCardiovascular\nIn clinical research, palpitations have been reported for patients taking St. John's wort orally, although the number of these events was higher for the patients taking sertraline (76070). In one case report, an adult female developed recurrent palpitations and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) within 3 weeks of initiating St. John's wort 300 mg daily. SVT and related symptoms responded to Valsalva maneuvers and did not recur after discontinuing therapy (106051).\n\nEdema has also been reported in clinical research for some patients treated with St. John's wort 900-1500 mg daily for 8 weeks (10843). Cardiovascular collapse following induction of anesthesia has been reported in an otherwise healthy patient who had been taking St. John's wort for 6 months (8931). A case of St. John's wort-induced hypertension has been reported for a 56-year-old patient who used St. John's wort extract 250 mg twice daily for 5 weeks. Blood pressure normalized after discontinuation of treatment (76073). A case of new-onset orthostatic hypotension and light-headedness has been reported for a 70 year-old homebound patient who was taking multiple prescription medications and herbal products, including St. John's wort (76128). When all herbal products were discontinued, these symptoms improved, and the patient experienced improvement in pain control.\nless\nDermatologic\nBoth topical and chronic oral use of St. John's wort can cause photodermatitis (206, 620, 758, 4628, 4631, 6477, 13156, 17986, 76072, 76148)(95506, 110318). The average threshold dose range for an increased risk of photosensitivity appears to be 1.8-4 grams St. John's wort extract or 5-10 mg hypericin, daily. Lower doses might not cause this effect (4542, 7808). For example, a single dose of St. John's wort extract 1800 mg (5.4 mg hypericin) followed by 900 mg (2.7 mg hypericin) daily does not seem to produce skin hypericin concentrations thought to be high enough to cause phototoxicity (3900, 4542, 76266). Females appear to have a higher risk of dose-related photosensitivity. In a dose-ranging, small clinical trial, almost all of the female participants experienced mild to moderate photosensitivity with paresthesia in sun-exposed skin areas after administration of St. John's wort (Jarsin, Casella Med) 1800 mg daily for 3-6 days. Symptoms resolved about 12-16 days after discontinuation (95506). Male participants reported no adverse effects at this dose, and both genders reported no adverse effects at lower doses. Light or fair-skinned people should employ protective measures against direct sunlight when using St. John's wort either topically or orally (628).\n\nTotal body erythroderma without exposure to sunlight, accompanied by burning sensation of the skin, has also been reported (8930). Orally, St. John's wort may cause pruritus or skin rash, although these events seem to occur infrequently (76140, 76148, 76245). A case of persistent scalp and eyebrow hair loss has been reported for a 24-year-old schizophrenic female who was taking olanzapine plus St. John's wort 900 mg/day orally (7811). Also, a case of surgical site irritation has been reported for a patient who applied ointment containing St. John's wort (17225).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in a 67-year-old male with depression has been reported. During a 3-month period, the patient was taking St. John's wort 300 mg daily then increased to 600-900 mg daily with no adverse effects despite a low serum sodium level of 122mEq/L, elevated levels of urine sodium, and urine osmolality suggestive of SIADH. St. John's wort appeared to be the only contributing factor. The patient's sodium level normalized 3 weeks after discontinuation of St. John's wort (95508).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, St. John's wort may cause dyspepsia, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, although these events seems to occur infrequently (4897, 13021, 17986, 76070, 76071, 76113, 76146, 76150, 76271).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, St. John's wort can cause intermenstrual or abnormal menstrual bleeding (1292, 76056). However, this effect has occurred in patients who were also taking an oral contraceptive. Changes in menstrual bleeding might be the result of a drug interaction (1292, 76056). Also, St. John's wort has been associated with anorgasmia and frequent urination when used orally (10843, 76070).\n\nSexual dysfunction can occur with St. John's wort, but less frequently than with SSRIs (10843). A case of erectile dysfunction and orgasmic delay has been reported for a 49-year-old male after taking St. John's wort orally for one week. Co-administration of sildenafil 25-50 mg prior to sexual activity reversed the sexual dysfunction. Previously, the patient had experienced orgasmic delay, erectile dysfunction, and inhibited sexual desire when taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline) (4836).\nless\nHepatic\nA case of acute hepatitis with prolonged cholestasis and features of vanishing bile duct syndrome has been reported for a patient who used tibolone and St. John's wort orally for 10 weeks (76135). A case of jaundice with transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia has been reported for a 79 year-old female who used St. John's wort and copaiba (95505). Laboratory values normalized 7 weeks after discontinuation of both products.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, St. John's wort may cause muscle or joint stiffness, tremor, muscle spasms, or pain, although these events appear to occur rarely (76070).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nSt. John's wort may cause headache, dizziness, fatigue, lethargy, or insomnia (5096, 13021, 76070, 76071, 76113, 76132, 76133, 76150, 89666). Isolated cases of paresthesia have been reported for patients taking St. John's wort (5073). A case of subacute toxic neuropathy has been reported for a 35-year-old female who took St. John's wort 500 mg daily orally for 4 weeks (621).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nThere is concern that taking St. John's wort might increase the risk of cataracts. The hypericin constituent of St. John's wort is photoactive and, in the presence of light, may damage lens proteins, leading to cataracts (1296, 17088). In population research, people with cataracts were significantly more likely to have used St. John's wort compared to people without cataracts (17088). Ear and labyrinth disorders have been possibly attributed to use of St. John's wort in clinical research, although these events rarely occur (76120).\nless\nPsychiatric\nSt. John's wort can induce hypomania in depressed patients and mania in depressed patients with occult bipolar disorder (325, 3524, 3555, 3568, 10845, 76047, 76064, 76137, 110318). Cases of first-episode psychosis have been reported for females who used St. John's wort orally. In both cases, symptoms resolved following discontinuation of St. John's wort and treatment with antipsychotics for several weeks (13015, 89664). Also, psychosis and delirium have been reported for a 76-year-old female patient who used St. John's wort for 3 weeks. The patient may have been predisposed to this effect due to undiagnosed dementia (76270). Restlessness, insomnia, panic, and anxiety have been noted for some patients taking St. John's wort orally (5073, 13156, 76070, 76132, 76268, 76269, 89665).\n\nIn isolated cases, St. John's wort has been associated with a syndrome consisting of extreme anxiety, confusion, nausea, hypertension, and tachycardia. These symptoms may occur within 2-3 weeks after it is started, in patients with no other predisposing factors. This syndrome has been diagnosed as the serotonin syndrome (6201, 7811, 110318). In one case, the symptoms began after consuming tyramine-containing foods, including aged cheese and red wine (7812). In an isolated case, a 51-year-old female reported having had suicidal and homicidal thoughts for 9 months while taking vitamin C and a St. John's wort extract. Symptoms disappeared within 3 weeks of discontinuing treatment (76111). A case of decreased libido has been reported for a 42-year-old male with mood and anxiety disorders who had taken St. John's wort orally for 9 months (7312).\n\nSt. John's wort has been associated with withdrawal effects similar to those found with conventional antidepressants. Headache, nausea, anorexia, dry mouth, thirst, cold chills, weight loss, dizziness, insomnia, paresthesia, confusion, and fatigue have been reported. Withdrawal effects are most likely to occur within two days after discontinuation but can occur one week or more after stopping treatment in some people. Occurrence of withdrawal symptoms may not be related to dose or duration of use (3569, 11801).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, St. John's wort may cause sore throat, swollen glands, laryngitis, sinus ache, sweating, and hot flashes, although the frequency of these events appears to be similar to placebo (76150).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, St. John's wort has been associated with a case report of acute kidney failure in a 46-year-old female after one dose of homemade St. John's wort tea. Three sessions of hemodialysis were required before there was full recovery (106741). However, causality is unclear since the patient had also been taking diclofenac intermittently for a month prior to developing kidney failure.\nless\nOther\nSjogren's syndrome has been reported in a patient taking herbal supplements including St. John's wort, echinacea, and kava. Echinacea may have been the primary cause, because Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The role of St. John's wort in causing this syndrome is unclear (10319).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDepression. Specific formulations of oral St. John's wort are effective for mild or moderate major depressive disorder. St. John's wort may also cause fewer side effects than certain conventional antidepressants.\nModerate quality meta-analyses and individual clinical trials show that St. John's wort extracts are more effective than placebo (76057, 76140, 76143, 76271, 89669, 104036), and likely as effective as low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (6434, 76143), tetracyclic antidepressants (76174), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (76143, 76144, 96551), including fluoxetine (Prozac) (3550, 4897), sertraline (Zoloft) (6400), and paroxetine (Paxil) (13021) for treating depression. However, some of these studies have been critiqued for using lower doses of SSRIs than typical dosing in comparative studies (104037). St. John's wort also seems to have better tolerability and less gastrointestinal, neurologic, and sexual adverse effects than certain conventional antidepressants (104036).\n\nTaking St. John's wort extract improves mood and decreases anxiety, somatic symptoms, and insomnia related to mild to severe major depression (3550, 4897, 6400, 13021, 13157, 76143, 104036). Short-term response rates to St. John's wort appear to be between 65% and 100%; however, long-term, the response rates appear to range from 60% to 69% (13156).\n\nMost studies have evaluated St. John's wort in adults; however, there is also some evidence that taking St. John's wort 300-1800 mg daily might be effective for depression in children less than 17 years old (4538, 10844, 76110). There is some concern that St. John's wort may not be effective for severe major depressive disorder necessitating psychiatric care. Two studies in psychiatric care settings showed no benefit of using St. John's wort (5096, 10843).\n\nClinical guidelines from the American College of Physicians state that St. John's wort may be as effective and better tolerated than conventional antidepressants for mild to moderate depression (104037). Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that St. John's wort is recommended as monotherapy for mild to moderate forms of major depressive disorder (110318). There is no guarantee that people living in the United States can obtain St. John's wort preparations of similar potency and effectiveness as those used in clinical research (104037). The CANMAT Taskforce recommendation is for specific formulations of 3:1 to 7:1 extracts, standardized to approximately 0.2-0.3% hypericin and/or 5-6% hyperforin, in single or divided doses of 600 mg to 1800 mg daily (110318). Most studies have used St. John's wort extracts standardized to hypericin content, usually 0.3%, but extracts standardized to 1% to 4% hyperforin also seem to be effective. Extracts containing hypericin 0.2% to 0.3%, including LI 160 (Lichtwer Pharma) and Remotiv (Zeller) have most often been studied in doses of 300 mg three times daily for up to 6 weeks, or 250 mg twice daily for up to 6 weeks. Extracts containing 3% to 6% hyperforin, including Movana (Pharmaton) and WS 5570 (Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) have most often been studied in doses of 300-600 mg three times daily for 6-26 weeks (761, 4538, 4630, 104036).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral St. John's wort seems to be beneficial for patients with menopausal symptoms.\nMost clinical research shows that taking St. John's wort as a single supplement can reduce menopausal symptoms. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in menopausal adults shows that taking St. John's wort up to 900 mg daily for up to 16 weeks, alone or in combination with other herbs, reduces frequency and severity of hot flashes when compared with placebo (95510). Some research also suggests that St. John's wort might improve quality of life and psychological symptoms when compared with placebo (76043, 76146, 89666, 95510). St. John's wort has also shown benefit when used in combination with black cohosh (Remifemin Plus, Schaper & Brummer GmbH & Co. KG; Gynoplus, Jin-Yang Pharm; Feramin Q, Dongkook Pharm) (15037, 15893, 35853, 95510), and with Vitex agnus-castus (41482).\nless\nSomatic symptom disorder. Oral St. John's wort seems to be beneficial for patients with somatoform disorder.\nTwo clinical trials in patients with somatoform disorders shows that taking a specific standardized St. John's wort extract (LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma) 600 mg daily seems to reduce symptoms of somatization disorder by 45% after 6 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo (9476, 76089).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBurning mouth syndrome. Oral St. John's wort does not appear to reduce pain from burning mouth syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking St. John's wort 300 mg (standardized to hypericin 0.3% and hyperforin 3.0%) three times daily for 12 weeks does not alleviate pain when compared to placebo (76133).\nless\nHepatitis C. St. John's wort contains hypericin. Synthetic hypericin has been studied and shown to be ineffective as an oral drug for hepatitis C.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection shows that giving synthetic hypericin 0.05-0.1 mg/kg orally daily does not seem to be effective for reducing viral load and may be unsafe due to the risk for phototoxic reactions (4631).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. St. John's wort contains hypericin. Synthetic hypericin has been studied and shown to be ineffective as an oral and intravenous drug for HIV.\nA small clinical study in adults infected with HIV shows that giving synthetic hypericin 0.25-0.5 mg/kg, either intravenously 2-3 times weekly or orally every day, as an antiretroviral agent does not seem to be effective and may be unsafe due to the risk for phototoxic reactions, which occurred in about 50% of patients (206).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral St. John's wort does not seem to improve symptoms in patients with IBS.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific St. John's wort extract (St. John's Wort Extract Extra Strength, Enzymatic Therapy) 450 mg twice daily is no more effective than placebo for reducing symptoms of IBS after 12 weeks of treatment. In fact, patients taking placebo had improved symptoms compared to St. John's wort (16893).\nless\nPeripheral neuropathy. Oral St. John's wort does not seem to relieve pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with polyneuropathy shows that taking St. John's wort containing 0.9 mg hypericin orally daily for 5 weeks does not seem to relieve most measures of pain when compared with placebo (7047).\nless\nSocial anxiety disorder. Oral St. John's wort does not seem to be beneficial for patients with social anxiety disorder.\nA small clinical study shows that taking St. John's wort 600-1800 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve social phobia or social anxiety disorder when compared with placebo (76101).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if topical St. John's wort is beneficial for acne.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate acne treated with photodynamic therapy shows that topical application with 1.5 mL of a St. John's wort 0.5% extract (DR-Light complex; Genicos Co., Ltd, Cheongju, Korea) for 10 minutes for four weekly sessions reduces acne lesion count as effectively as treatment with indole-3-acetic acid (110327).\nless\nAnxiety. Although there is interest in using oral St. John's wort for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of St. John's wort for this condition.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for improving symptoms in children with ADHD.\nA small clinical study in children ages 6-17 years with ADHD shows that taking a specific St. John's wort extract standardized to 0.3% hypericin, 300 mg three times daily for 8 weeks, does not improve symptoms such as inattentiveness when compared with placebo (17986).\nless\nBrain tumor. St. John's wort contains hypericin. Synthetic hypericin has been studied as an oral drug for malignant brain tumors, with unclear benefit.\nA small clinical study in patients with malignant gliomas shows that taking synthetic hypericin 0.05-0.5 mg/kg daily orally for up to 3 months was associated with stable disease in 7 of 42 patients and partial response in 2 of 42 patients (76160). However, it is unclear how these outcomes would compare with historical controls or a prospectively enrolled control group.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral St. John's wort for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of St. John's wort for this condition.\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome type 2. It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for patients with this condition.\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of bilirubin in the body. One case report of a 24 year-old female with this condition shows that taking St. John's wort (Jarsin LI160, Vifor SA) 300 mg three times daily by mouth for two 8-week periods 18 months apart decreases bilirubin levels by 34%, reduces jaundice, and improves fatigue (95509).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there is interest in using oral St. John's wort for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of St. John's wort for this condition.\nGenital herpes. Topical St. John's wort has only been evaluated in combination with copper sulfate; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or 2 (HSV-2) shows that applying a single dose of a specific topical product (Dynamiclear, Global Herbal Supplies Pty Ltd), which contains St. John's wort 0.1% and copper sulfate pentahydrate 5%, helps reduce symptoms such as stinging, burning, erythema, and pain. In fact, the combination product appears to reduce erythema, itching, and pain more than applying acyclovir 5% (Zovirax, Glaxo Smith Kline) five times daily for 7 days (76164).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Topical St. John's wort has only been evaluated in combination with copper sulfate; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or 2 (HSV-2) shows that applying a single dose of a specific topical product (Dynamiclear, Global Herbal Supplies Pty Ltd), which contains St. John's wort 0.1% and copper sulfate pentahydrate 5%, helps reduce symptoms such as stinging, burning, erythema, and pain. In fact, the combination product appears to reduce erythema, itching, and pain more than applying acyclovir 5% (Zovirax, Glaxo Smith Kline) five times daily for 7 days (76164).\nless\nMastitis. It is unclear if topical St. John's wort is beneficial for granulomatous mastitis.\nIn patients with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, persistent or intractable skin lesions may remain after treatment with oral steroids and antibiotics. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical application with St. John's wort oil for two minutes twice daily for 6 weeks reduces the severity of skin lesions in patients with persistent lesions following treatment. After treatment, the success rate, based on clearance or remaining mild symptoms, was 94.1% (110326).\nless\nMemory. It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for improving memory in healthy people.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a specific supplement (Remotiv, Zeller) containing St. John's wort 250 mg, standardized to 0.5 mg of hypericin, by mouth as a single dose, seems to improve short-term memory when compared with baseline. In contrast, the same product containing a higher dose of St. John's wort, 500 mg, seems to worsen memory when compared with baseline (100245). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for reducing migraine headache.\nA small low quality clinical study in patients with migraines suggests that adding a specific St. John's wort product (Perforan, Godaru) 160 mg three times daily to sodium valproate 400 mg daily might modestly improve migraine intensity, but not migraine frequency, when compared with sodium valproate alone (89667).\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for reducing OCD symptoms.\nThere is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of St. John's wort for OCD. A small open-label study suggests that taking a specific St. John's wort extract standardized to 0.3% hypericin (Alterra, Upsher-Smith Laboratories) 450 mg twice daily for 12 weeks might improve symptoms of OCD when compared to baseline (5075). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. A small, higher quality clinical study using a different St. John's wort extract (LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma AG) 600-1800 mg daily for 12 weeks shows that it does not improve symptoms of OCD when compared with placebo (14417). However, this study excluded patients with concomitant depression, so it's unclear if St. John's wort might improve OCD symptoms in patients with depression.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical St. John's wort is beneficial for osteoarthritis. Oral St. John's wort is not studied for this use.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that applying St. John's wort oil (concentration unknown) to the knees three times a day for 21 days improves patient-reported pain, stiffness, and function scores when compared with placebo (olive oil) (113093). However, participants were aware of which treatment they received and were allowed to continue use of analgesics as needed, which limits the validity of this study.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral St. John's wort has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that taking three tablets containing St. John's wort, licorice root, Ceylon cinnamon, levant berry, peony, and Tribulus daily for 3 months, in addition to lifestyle changes, improves oligomenorrhea by 33% and quality of life by 30% when compared with lifestyle changes alone in adults with PCOS (97216). It is unclear if these effects are due to St. John's wort, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for patients with PMS.\nThere is conflicting evidence on the effects of St. John's wort for treating PMS, although most evidence suggests benefit. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific St. John's wort extract standardized to contain 0.18% hypericin and 3.38% hyperforin (LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma AG) 450 mg twice daily for two menstrual cycles reduces physical and behavioral PMS symptoms, but not mood or pain, when compared with placebo (76150). Another clinical study shows that taking St. John's wort extract containing hypericin 1.36 mg daily for two menstrual cycles can reduce symptoms of PMS, including anxiety, depression, forgetfulness, crying, headache, and fatigue, when compared with placebo (76159). However, one clinical study shows that taking St. John's wort 600 mg (standardized to contain 1.8 mg of hypericin) does not reduce anxiety or other PMS symptoms when compared with placebo (76104). The conflicting results may be due to differences in St. John's wort formulations and dosages.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical St. John's wort improves symptoms in patients with plaque psoriasis.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild or moderate plaque psoriasis shows that applying an ointment containing St. John's wort extract 5% twice daily to one side of the body for 4 weeks modestly decreases the severity, thickness, and degree of erythema of psoriasis plaques when compared with applying placebo ointment to the other side of the body (95940).\nless\nScleroderma. Topical St. John's wort has only been evaluated in combination with neem oil; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational study in patients with systemic sclerosis has found that topical application of a specific cream (Holoil, RI.MOS. SRL) containing St. John's wort and neem oil is associated with improved healing, decreased pain, and reduced need for surgical interventions and antibiotics when compared with a control group (102867). It is unknown if these effects are due to St. John's wort, neem, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these results is limited by a lack of randomization, blinding, and placebo-control.\nless\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD). It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for patients with SAD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that St. John's wort extract improves symptoms associated with SAD, including anxiety, decreased libido, and sleep disturbances, when compared with baseline. It may be beneficial when used alone or in combination with light therapy (9686, 76175). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSmoking cessation. It is unclear if oral St. John's wort is beneficial for patients trying to quit smoking.\nA small clinical study in cigarette smokers shows that taking a specific St. John's wort extract (LI-160, Lichtwer Pharma US) 300 mg once or twice daily, starting 1 week before and continuing for 3 months after quitting smoking, is associated with a continuous abstinence rate of 18% at 3 months and 0% at 12 months, suggesting a lack of benefit (14481).\nless\nTinnitus. St. John's wort has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in adults with tinnitus shows that taking St. John's wort 600 mg and ginkgo biloba daily for 12 weeks does not suppress tinnitus or improve tinnitus-related handicap when compared with ginkgo biloba monotherapy (111513).\nless\nWound healing. Topical St. John's wort seems to improve wound healing and wound-related pain for certain types of surgery.\nA clinical study in patients who have had a Cesarean section shows that applying ointment containing St. John's wort extract 20% three times a day for 16 days improves wound healing and reduces scar formation when compared with placebo ointment (17225).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients who have had impacted third molars removed shows that using a mouthwash, prepared by macerating the above ground parts of St. John's wort in virgin olive oil, for 60 days is as effective as chlorhexidine gluconate plus benzydamine hydrochloride mouthwash for improving periodontal healing, and reducing swelling, pain, and infectious complications. However, it was also as effective as plain virgin olive oil, suggesting that St. John's wort did not provide additional benefit. 15 mL of each mouthwash was swished for 30 seconds 3 times daily for 7 days (104957).\n\nSt. John's wort has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with dehisced post-surgical wounds shows that applying a specific aerosol product (1PWD, Kerecis AG) containing St. John's wort and neem oil to wounds during dressing changes does not improve wound healing scores at day 28 but may reduce pain scores when compared with silver-based dressings (alginates or polyurethane foam) (111592). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. It is also unclear if these effects are due to St. John's wort, neem oil, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate St. John's wort for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nSt. John's wort extract is most commonly used in doses of 600-900 mg daily, taken in 2-3 divided doses, for up to 12 weeks (76143, 76174, 95510, 104036). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nSt. John's wort has been used in various topical formulations, including as an ointment, cream, and gel. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nVarious St. John's wort preparations used in clinical research have been standardized to hypericin or hyperforin content (7807, 100245). The specific standardized extract Lichtwer LI 160, which is contained in the product Kira (Lichtwer Pharma US, Inc.), is standardized to contain 0.3% hypericin (382, 4538). LI 160 WS, which is contained in the product Quanterra Emotional Balance (Warner-Lambert), is the hyperforin stabilized version of LI 160. Another St. John's wort extract called Alterra (Upsher-Smith Laboratories) is also standardized to contain 0.3% hypericin (5075). The St. John's wort extract ZE 117, which is contained in the product Remotiv (Zeller), is standardized to contain 0.2% hypericin (4897, 6434, 76271). Another St. John's wort extract WS 5572, which is contained in the product Movana (Pharmaton), is standardized to contain 5% hyperforin (761, 4630, 13021). The St. John's wort extract called WS 5570 is standardized to contain 3% to 6% hyperforin, 0.1 to 0.3% hypericin, at least 1.5% rutin, and at least 6% flavonoids (13021, 76071, 76140). The St. John's wort extract called WS 5573 is standardized to contain 0.5% hyperforin (761).\n\nSt. John's wort has also been used in combination with other ingredients. Specific combination products used in clinical research include Gynoplus (Jin-Yang Pharm) and Remifemin Plus (Schaper & Brummer GmbH & Co. KG), which both contain St. John's wort extract standardized to hypericin 0.25 mg and black cohosh extract standardized to triterpene glucosides 1 mg (15893, 35853); and Dynamiclear (Global Herbal Supplies Pty Ltd.), which contains St. John's wort 0.10% and copper sulfate pentahydrate 5.0% (76164).",

St. John's wort reduces the half-life of alprazolam from 12.4 hours to 6 hours (10830).\nless\nAMBRISENTAN (Letairis)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort may increase the clearance of ambristentan and decrease its effects.\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking St. John's wort 900 mg daily decreases the area under the concentration-time curve of ambrisentan 5 mg by 17% to 26%. Ambrisentan clearance was increased by 20% to 35% depending on CYP2C19 genotype. However, these small changes are unlikely to be clinically significant (99511).\nless\nAMINOLEVULINIC ACID\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nSt. John's wort might have additive phototoxic effects with aminolevulinic acid.\nConcomitant use with St. John's wort extract may cause synergistic phototoxicity. Delta-aminolevulinic acid can cause a burning erythematous rash and severe swelling of the face, neck, and hands when taken with St. John's wort (9474).\nless\nBOCEPREVIR (Victrelis)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort might decrease the levels and clinical effects of boceprevir.\nBoceprevir increases the maximum concentration and concentration at 8 hours of the St. John's wort constituent, hypericin, by approximately 30%. However, St. John's wort does not significantly change the area under the concentration-time curve or maximum plasma concentration of boceprevir 800 mg three times daily in healthy adults (95507, 96552).\nless\nBUPROPION (Wellbutrin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort might reduce the levels and effects of bupropion.\nClinical research shows that taking St. John's wort 325 mg three times daily for 14 days along with bupropion reduces the area under the concentration-time curve by approximately 14% and increases the clearance of bupropion by approximately 20%. This effect is attributed to the induction of cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) by St. John's wort (89662).\nless\nCLOPIDOGREL (Plavix)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort might increase the levels and effects of clopidogrel.\nTaking St. John's wort with clopidogrel seems to increase the activity of clopidogrel. In clopidogrel non-responders, taking St. John's wort seems to induce metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite by cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4 and 2C19. This leads to increased antiplatelet activity (13038, 89671, 96552). Theoretically, this might lead to an increased risk of bleeding in clopidogrel responders.\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nSt. John's wort might decrease the levels and clinical effects of clozapine.\nA case report describes a female with schizophrenia controlled on clozapine who had a return of symptoms when she started taking St. John's wort. The plasma concentration of clozapine was reduced, likely because its clearance was increased due to induction of the cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4, 1A2, 2C9, and 2C19 by St. John's wort (96552).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort increases the clearance of contraceptive drugs and reduces their clinical effects.\nFemales taking St. John's wort and oral contraceptives concurrently should use an additional or alternative form of birth control. St. John's wort can decrease norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol levels by 13% to 15%, resulting in breakthrough bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding, or unplanned pregnancy (11886, 11887, 13099). Bleeding irregularities usually occur within a week of starting St. John's wort and regular cycles usually return when St. John's wort is discontinued. Unplanned pregnancy has occurred with concurrent use of oral contraceptives and St. John's wort extract (9880). St. John's wort is thought to induce the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), 2C9 (CYP2C9), and 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes, which are responsible for metabolism of progestins and estrogens in contraceptives (1292, 7809, 9204).\nless\nCYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort reduces the levels and clinical effects of cyclosporine.\nConcomitant use can decrease plasma cyclosporine levels by 30% to 70% (1234, 4826, 4831, 4834, 7808, 9596, 10628, 96552). Using St. John's wort with cyclosporine in patients with heart, kidney, or liver transplants can cause subtherapeutic cyclosporine levels and acute transplant rejection (1234, 1293, 1301, 6112, 6435, 7808, 9596). This interaction has occurred with a St. John's wort extract standardized to 0.3% hypericin and dosed at 300-600 mg per day (6435, 10628). Withdrawal of St. John's wort can result in a 64% increase in cyclosporine levels (1234, 4513, 4826, 4831, 4834). St. John's wort induces cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and the multi-drug transporter, P-glycoprotein/MDR-1, which increases cyclosporine clearance (1293, 1340, 9204, 9596).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nSt. John's wort may increase the metabolism and reduce the levels of CYP1A2 substrates.\nClinical and in vitro research shows that St. John's wort induces CYP1A2, but to a lesser extent than CYP3A4 (9204, 10848, 76163, 111404).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort may increase the metabolism and reduce the levels of CYP2B6 substrates.\nClinical research shows that taking St. John's wort 325 mg three times daily for 14 days along with bupropion, a CYP2B6 substrate, reduces the area under the concentration-time curve by approximately 14% and increases the clearance of bupropion by approximately 20% (89662).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort may increase the metabolism and reduce the levels of CYP2C19 substrates.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy males shows that taking St. John's wort for 14 days induces CYP2C19 and increases metabolism of mephenytoin (Mesantoin). In patients with wild-type 2C19 (2C19*1/*1) metabolism was almost 4-fold greater in subjects who received St. John's wort compared to placebo. In contrast, patients with 2C19*2/*2 and *2/*3 genotypes did not demonstrate a similar increase in metabolism (17405). Theoretically, St. John's wort might increase metabolism of other CYP2C19 substrates.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nSt. John's wort may increase the metabolism and reduce the levels of CYP2C9 substrates.\nThere is contradictory research about the effect of St. John's wort on CYP2C9. Some in vitro research shows that St. John's wort induces CYP2C9, but to a lesser extent than CYP3A4 (9204, 10848, 11889). St. John's wort also induces metabolism of the S-warfarin isomer, which is a CYP2C9 substrate (11890). Other research shows that St. John's wort 300 mg three times daily for 21 days does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 400 mg dose of ibuprofen, which is also a CYP2C9 substrate (15546). Until more is known, use St. John's wort cautiously in patients who are taking CYP2C9 substrates.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort increases the metabolism and reduces the levels of CYP3A4 substrates.\nSt. John's wort induces CYP3A4 enzymes and increases metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates (9204, 10830, 10847, 10848, 11889, 22423, 22424, 22425, 22427, 48603, 111404, 111644, 113094). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with St. John's wort products containing hyperforin 1 mg or more (97171).\nless\nDIGOXIN (Lanoxin)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nSt. John's wort reduces the levels and clinical effects of digoxin.\nSt. John's wort can reduce the bioavailability, serum levels, and therapeutic effects of digoxin. Taking an extract of St. John's wort 900 mg, containing hyperforin 7.5 mg or more, daily for 10-14 days, can reduce serum digoxin levels by 25% in healthy people. St. John's wort is thought to affect the multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein, which mediates the absorption and elimination of digoxin and other drugs (382, 6473, 7808, 7810, 9204, 96552, 97171). St. John's wort products providing less than 7.5 mg of hyperforin daily do not appear to affect digoxin levels (97171).\nless\nDOCETAXEL (Taxotere)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort reduces the levels and clinical effects of docetaxel.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific St. John's wort product (Hyperiplant, VSM) 300 mg three times daily for 14 days increases docetaxel clearance by about 14%, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of docetaxel in cancer patients. This is most likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by St. John's wort (89661).\nless\nFENTANYL\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, St. John's wort may reduce the levels and clinical effects of fentanyl.\nGiven that St. John's wort induces cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein, it is possible that concomitant use of St. John's wort with fentanyl will reduce plasma levels and analgesic activity of fentanyl (96552). However, some clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking St. John's wort (LI-160, Lichtwer Pharma) 300 mg daily for 21 days does not alter the pharmacokinetics or clinical effects of intravenous fentanyl (102868). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to oral, intranasal, or transdermal fentanyl.\nless\nFEXOFENADINE (Allegra)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort may increase the levels and clinical effects of fexofenadine.\nA single dose of St. John's wort decreases the clearance of fexofenadine and increases its plasma levels. However, the effect of St. John's wort on plasma levels of fexofenadine seems to be lost if dosing is continued for more than 2 weeks (9685). Patients taking fexofenadine and St. John's wort concurrently should be monitored for possible fexofenadine toxicity.\nless\nFINASTERIDE (Proscar, Propecia)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nSt. John's wort may reduce the levels and clinical effects of finasteride.\nSt. John's wort reduces plasma levels of finasteride in healthy male volunteers due to induction of finasteride metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The clinical significance of this interaction is not known (96552).\nless\nGLICLAZIDE (Diamicron, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nSt. John's wort may reduce the levels and clinical effects of gliclazide.\nTaking St. John's wort decreases the half-life and increases clearance of gliclazide in healthy people (22431).\nless\nHMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS (\"Statins\")\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSt. John's wort may increase the metabolism and reduce the effectiveness of atorvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin. However, it does not seem to affect pravastatin, pitavastatin, or fluvastatin.\nConcomitant use of St. John's wort can reduce plasma concentrations of the active simvastatin metabolite, simvastatin hydroxy acid, by 28%. St. John's wort induces intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and intestinal P-glycoprotein/MDR-1, a drug transporter. This increases simvastatin clearance. It also increases the clearance of atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Mevacor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). St. John's wort does not seem to affect the plasma concentrations of pravastatin (Pravachol), pitavastatin (Livalo) or fluvastatin (Lescol), which are not substrates of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (10627, 96552, 97171).\nless\nIMATINIB (Gleevec)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nSt. John's wort reduces the levels and clinical effects of imatinib.\nTaking St. John's wort 900 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces the bioavailability and half-life of a single dose of imatinib and decreases its serum levels by 30% in healthy volunteers. This is most likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by St. John's wort, which increases clearance of imatinib (11888, 96552).\nless\nINDINAVIR (Crixivan)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nSt. John's wort may reduce the levels and clinical effects of indinavir.\nIn healthy volunteers, taking St. John's wort concurrently with indinavir reduces plasma concentrations of indinavir by inducing metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (96552).

Clearance of the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is also increased, resulting in a 42% decrease in the area under the concentration-time curve (9206, 97171).

St. John's wort is thought to lower tacrolimus levels by inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes (7095, 10329). A small clinical study in healthy adults also shows that taking St. John's wort 300 mg three times daily for 10 days decreases the total systemic exposure to tacrolimus by 27% and 33% after taking a single 5 mg dose of immediate-release or prolonged-release tacrolimus, respectively (113094).\nless\nTHEOPHYLLINE\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nSt. John's wort might decrease the levels of theophylline, although this effect might not be clinically relevant.\nSt. John's wort does not seem to significantly affect theophylline pharmacokinetics (11802). There is a single case report of a possible interaction with theophylline. A patient who smoked and was taking 11 other drugs experienced an increase in theophylline levels after discontinuation of St. John's wort. This increase has been attributed to a rebounding of theophylline serum levels after St. John's wort was no longer present to induce metabolism via cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (3556, 7808, 9204).

This is likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP3A4 (11890). St. John's wort can also significantly decrease International Normalized Ratio (INR) in people taking warfarin (1292). In addition, taking warfarin at the same time as St. John's wort might reduce warfarin bioavailability.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration of hyperforin 300 mg, steady state plasma concentrations were approximately 100 ng/mL (76195). After long-term dosing of St. John's wort extract (300 mg three times daily), steady state was reached after 4 days (76179). After single oral doses of St. John's wort extract 300 mg, 900 mg, or 1800 mg, the median maximal plasma levels were 1.5, 4.1, and 14.2 ng/mL, respectively, for hypericin, and 2.7, 11.7, and 30.6 ng/mL, respectively, for pseudohypericin (76179). In humans given St. John's wort extract 300 mg (5% hyperforin), maximum plasma concentration of hyperforin was 150 ng/mL, 3.5 hours after oral administration (76195). After single-dose intake of dry extract of St. John's wort 612 mg, the maximum plasma concentration of hypericin was 3.14 ng/mL after about 8 hours, and 83.5 ng/mL for hyperforin after 4.4 hours (70326). Systemic availability of hypericin and pseudohypericin after oral administration has been estimated at 14% and 21%, respectively (76187).\nDistribution\nA distribution half-life of 3 hours was noted for hyperforin (76195). Levels of hypericin and pseudohypericin were higher in the serum than the skin blister fluid after both a single dose of St. John's wort extract LI 160 (serum 43 ng/mL, skin blister fluid 5.3 ng/mL) and a 7-day steady state dose (serum: 12.5 ng/mL, skin blister fluid: 2.8 ng/mL) (3547).\nMetabolism\nIn animal research, hyperforin was metabolized in the liver by the hydroxylation pathway (76081). Four major phase I metabolites (19-hydroxyhyperforin, 24-hydroxyhyperforin, 29-hydroxyhyperforin, and 34-hydroxyhyperforin) were isolated (76081).\nExcretion\nThe elimination half-life is 24-36 hours for hypericin (76253); 9-20 hours for hyperforin (70326); 9-24 hours for hypericin (70326, 76195); and 25 hours for pseudohypericin (70326).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of St. John's wort are the flowers and, to a lesser extent, the leaves. The main active constituents are napthodianthrones including hypericin and pseudohypericin, phloroglucinols including hyperforin, and flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin (50, 761, 76062, 96552). Although hypericin was formerly thought to be the component of St. John's wort principally responsible for its antidepressant action, it is now understood that hyperforin, adhyperforin, and several other related compounds are the primary active constituents (762, 763, 4521, 4629, 7807, 11408, 76192, 76253).\n\nSeveral factors might influence product variability of St. John's wort. The constituents of St. John's wort seem to have seasonal and regional variations (8933, 8934). The hyperforin and hypericin constituents appear to be sensitive to light; amber containers or opaque capsules don't seem to completely protect from light degradation. These constituents may also be sensitive to storage temperature and humidity (8935).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that hyperforin may stimulate IL-8 expression in human intestinal epithelia cells (IEC) and primary hepatocytes. Hyperforin may induce the expression of mRNA for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Hyperforin may also induce IL-8 mRNA through an SXR-independent transcriptional activation pathway. IL-8 induction by hyperforin requires the activation of AP-1. Further research revealed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) were required for the hyperforin-induced expression of IL-8 (76100). Extracts of St. John's wort strongly downregulated mitogen-mediated tryptophan degradation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect seems to result from a suppressive activity of St. John's wort on activated immunocompetent cells, resulting in a diminished production of IFN-gamma (76102).\n\nHyperforin has also been shown to target components within the G protein signaling cascades involved in the regulation of Ca2+homeostasis, resulting in regulation of ROS generation and the release of leukocyte elastase from human isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (76084). In vitro evidence shows that hyperforin inhibits IL-6 release from human astrocytoma cells (U373MG). In whole blood, however, hyperforin levels needed to inhibit IL-6 release are about one order of magnitude higher than the hyperforin levels measured in the plasma of rats or humans treated with pharmacologically active doses of St. John's wort or hyperforin (76090).\n\nIn vivo, hypericin treatment-inhibits NF-kappaB-induced accumulation of phosphorylated IkappaB-alpha, decreases p50 protein levels, and induces cleavage of p65 protein in U373 and MCF-7 cells (76103).\nAntidepressant effects\nThe St. John's wort constituents hyperforin and adhyperforin appear to modulate the effects of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (763, 3553, 4521, 6474, 11408, 76045, 76188, 76191, 76194), and may inhibit reuptake of these neurotransmitters (763, 6427, 8936, 76049, 76055, 76273). St. John's wort also seems to act as a serotonergic 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (762), and down-regulate beta-adrenergic, and serotonergic 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors when used chronically in animals (763, 4632). These influences on neurotransmission appear to cause cortisol stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (11408). Hyperforin also inhibits synaptosomal uptake of gamma-butyric acid (GABA) and L-glutamate (3553, 4521).\n\nSt. John's wort effects on serotonin may be primarily responsible for its antidepressant activity (8936). Many constituents appear to contribute to the antidepressant action (762, 4520, 4521). Hypericin inhibits catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro (76170, 76180, 76249). However, hypericin does not reach adequate concentrations in human tissue to achieve these effects (167, 759, 76179, 76181, 76189). St. John's wort extract and its constituent hypericin have affinity for sigma receptors and acts as a receptor antagonist at adenosine, benzodiazepine, GABA-A, GABA-B, and inositol triphosphate receptors (759, 76189). Preclinical research suggests that a 50% ethanolic extract of St. John's wort might have anxiolytic activity (8932).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSt. John's wort and its constituents, hypericin and pseudohypericin, have activity against viruses and bacteria, including influenza virus, herpes simplex virus types I and II, Sindbis virus, poliovirus, retrovirus, murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C, and Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes (3554, 110327). Hyperforin can inhibit growth of penicillin- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram positive organisms, but not Gram negative organisms (3554).\nAntineoplastic effects\nHyperforin might have activity against cancer cells. It seems to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer cell types, including leukemia and glioma cell lines, by inducing apoptosis (9205, 76075, 76092, 76173). Animal research has also shown that St. John's wort extract can induce apoptosis in a mouse tumor model (76076). It is not known if these effects will have clinical applicability. However, preliminary clinical research has shown that taking hypericin 0.05-0.50 mg/kg for up to 3 months may decrease glioma size in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas (76160).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn rats, administration of scopolamine 1.4 mg/kg impaired retrieval memory. This amnesia was associated with elevated MDA and reduced GSH brain levels. In naive rats, which lacked exposure to conditioned fear, scopolamine administration also increased MDA and reduced GSH levels, although with an increase in brain GSHPx activity. Pretreatment of the animals with St. John's wort extract (4, 8, and 12 mg/kg) resulted in an antioxidant effect through altering brain MDA, GSHPx, and/or GSH levels or activity. Low concentrations of St. John's wort extract displayed an inverse dose-related relationship of superoxide inhibition (76079). Free radical-scavenging activity of St. John's wort has been found to correlate with its flavonoid constituents, including hyperoside and quercetin (76061, 76079).\nAntiviral effects\nA variety of in vitro studies have documented the antiviral properties of St. John's wort (76074, 76119, 76121, 76124, 76125, 76127, 76251, 76168, 76169, 76186). A photodynamic mechanism has been proposed for the mechanism of action of HIV inactivation (76074, 76119, 76184). In human research, a topical combination product that contained copper sulfate pentahydrate and St. John's wort demonstrated efficacy in improving symptoms of herpes lesions such as pain and erythema (76164).\nDermatologic effects\nTopical preparations of St. John's wort are thought to be beneficial for inflammatory skin conditions and superficial wounds by inhibiting epidermal inflammatory response. It is likely that both the hypericin and hyperforin contribute to this effect (6426, 99512). The elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) found in the plasma and skin of people with psoriasis are significantly reduced by treatment with a 5% St. John's wort ointment for 4 weeks (95940). Evidence from a case report also shows that St. John's wort can improve the healing of pressure ulcers by improving epithelization (99512).\nDrug metabolism\nSt. John's wort is a potent inducer of some cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. This results in increased metabolism and reduced plasma concentrations of many drugs (1292, 1293, 1303, 3570, 3599, 4835, 6425, 7808). It appears that the hyperforin constituent is responsible for interactions. Hypericin does not seem to significantly affect drug metabolism (11889). St. John's wort extract increases induction activity of CYP3A4 by 98% (1303). The effect on CYP3A4 seems to be greater in females than males (10830, 10847, 11889). It also induces CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 (11889, 11890). St. John's wort does not affect, or has a marginal effect, on CYP2D6 (3599, 4835, 10830, 10847, 10848, 11889). Some discrepancies in reports about the effect of St. John's wort on CYP isozymes may reflect variability in St. John's wort preparations (10849).\n\nSome in vitro studies report inhibition (instead of induction) of several CYP450 enzymes by St. John's wort (15549). This occurs when high concentrations of St. John's wort or its constituents are applied to hepatic cell cultures. It does not appear to be clinically relevant. The hyperforin constituent in St. John's wort seems to bind to a nuclear receptor called the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which results in increased expression of CYP3A4 (6463, 6475). St. John's wort also induces the intestinal P-glycoprotein/multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR-1) drug transporter (1340). Induction of both intestinal P-glycoprotein/MDR-1 and hepatic CYP3A4 decreases the intestinal absorption and increases hepatic first pass clearance of numerous drugs such as cyclosporine, indinavir, and amitriptyline (382, 1340, 7808, 7810).\n\nSt. John's wort increases the metabolism of oral contraceptive estrogens, likely by inducing CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 (1292, 7809, 9204). However, preliminary research suggests that St. John's wort does not affect the anti-androgenic effects of oral contraceptives used for treating hirsutism and acne. It is thought that, in addition to inducing metabolism of the hormones in the oral contraceptive, St. John's wort may also be inducing metabolism of the endogenous androgens (15547).\n\nSt. John's wort does not significantly affect N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), which is involved in the metabolism of several drugs, including procainamide (3571, 14865). St. John's wort extracts can prolong narcotic-induced sleep time, decrease barbiturate-induced sleep time, and antagonize the effects of reserpine (758). There is preliminary evidence that St. John's wort can enhance the analgesic effect of morphine, but St. John's wort alone does not have analgesic effects (1279).\nImmunosuppressive effects\nAn immunosuppressive effect of hypericin was found in vitro, mediated by inhibition of arachidonic acid and interleukin-6 release, leukotriene B4, and interleukin-1alpha production (76254, 76183). An immunosuppressive effect, including an inhibition of T cell proliferation, was observed in vitro and in vivo in response to St. John's wort (6426). In vitro inhibition of free radical production has also been demonstrated in cell-free and human vascular tissue (76061).\nPhotosensitizing effects\nHypericin is photodynamically active and is thought to be the constituent responsible for phototoxic reactions (3547). In fact, hypericin has been studied in vitro as a comparison for other photosensitizers (76154, 76156). The flavonoid component of St. John's wort, primarily quercitrin, appears to play a role in controlling the severity of the phototoxic reactions (11490)."

The antioxidant effects of stereospermum possibly play a role (88140).\nHepatic effects\nStereospermum is traditionally used for liver disorders. In animal research, extracts of stereospermum bark have protected against streptozotocin- and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. Liver function tests, including aspartase aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, are reduced and necrosis is prevented (88132, 88136, 88139).\nNeuroprotective effects\nStereospermum is traditionally used for various brain disorders. In an animal ischemia model, stereospermum extract has neuroprotective effects and reduces infarct size (88143). In addition, it protects against experimentally-induced Parkinson disease (88142)."

            "Overview": "Stevia is a bushy, perennial shrub native to northeast Paraguay, as well as Brazil and Argentina, that is now cultivated in various parts of the world (76393, 90907). In Paraguay, stevia has traditionally been used as a sweetener and contraceptive (11, 76393). Extracts from the leaves are available as sweeteners in a number of countries (90907).",
            "Warnings": "In the US, stevia leaves and extract are not approved for use as a sweetener, although they may be used as a dietary supplement (90907). However, specific constituents of stevia, including stevioside and rebaudiosides A, D, and M, have been granted Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the US FDA for use as food sweeteners (11808, 16699, 90907, 108049).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when certain stevia constituents, including stevioside and rebaudiosides A, D, and M, are used orally as sweeteners in foods. These constituents have generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status in the US for this purpose (16699, 16700, 16702, 16705, 16706, 108049). The stevia constituent stevioside has been safely used in doses of up to 1500 mg daily for 2 years (11809, 11810, 11811, 113006).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of whole stevia or stevia extracts when used orally. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has determined that the acceptable intake of steviol glycosides is 4 mg/kg daily (106456); however, it is unclear how this relates to the use of whole stevia or stevia extract.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral stevia improves glycemic control in patients with diabetes; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in healthy adults and those with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or insulin resistance shows that consuming stevia or stevia constituents daily for up to 2 years slightly reduces blood glucose levels, but does not change glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when compared with placebo (117241). The effect of stevia on glycemic control in adults with diabetes is unclear from this meta-analysis.\n\nClinical studies specifically evaluating stevia in adults with diabetes, all of which are included in the meta-analysis above, show inconsistent benefits in glycemic control, with variations in study design, stevia formulations, and participant characteristics potentially contributing to the mixed results. One small study shows that taking stevia leaf extract 1000 mg, standardized to contain 91% stevioside, along with a meal reduces postprandial glucose levels by 18% in adults with type 2 diabetes when compared with a starch control (11812). However, clinical research in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes shows that taking stevioside 250 mg three times daily for 3 months does not affect blood glucose levels or HbA1C when compared with baseline (16705). Also, a small clinical study in patients with diabetes shows that drinking 200 mL of black tea, sweetened with stevia extract 2%, three times daily for 8 weeks does not affect glycemic indices when compared with drinking tea sweetened with sucralose (103695).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral stevia is beneficial in patients with hypertension; the available research is conflicting.\nSome clinical research in patients with mild to moderate hypertension shows that taking stevioside, a constituent of stevia, 750-1500 mg in three divided doses daily reduces systolic blood pressure by 10-14 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 6-14 mmHg within one week to three months of treatment initiation and continuing for up to 2 years (11809, 11810). However, other clinical research in patients with mild hypertension shows that taking stevioside in doses up to 15 mg/kg daily does not significantly reduce blood pressure (16706).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral stevia is beneficial in patients with obesity; the available research is conflicting.\nClinical research in adults with overweight and obesity shows that drinking a flavored beverage (1.25-1.75 L) sweetened with stevia 660 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or body fat when compared with baseline, but it may avoid the weight gain that occurs in the group consuming a similar volume of flavored beverage providing sucrose 100-140 grams daily (113009). Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking an aqueous stevia leaf extract (SweetLeaf) twice daily for 12 weeks does not affect body weight, compared with an increase in weight in the control group. This suggests that stevia extract may have attenuated weight gain in this study (106458).\n\nStevia has also been examined for its effect on appetite and energy intake. Although a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking water with stevia (Truvia) 245 ppm as a single dose reduces appetite and energy intake when compared with drinking water alone (103697), other small, single-dose studies have shown no effect of stevia 15.3 mg or 1 gram as a single dose on satiety, energy intake, or fullness when compared with either water alone or a non-nutritive sweetener (103696, 110124). Additionally, a small single dose study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that drinking a beverage sweetened with stevia constituents rebaudiosides A or M in conjunction with other non-nutritive sweeteners, such as either monk fruit extract, before a meal does not reduce appetite or subsequent energy intake when compared with a beverage sweetened with sucrose (113005).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate stevia for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with stevia.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAlthough early research in humans suggested that steviol glycosides, including stevioside and various rebaudiosides, were not detectable in plasma after oral administration (76332), other research indicates that the lack of detection in previous research was due to low oral bioavailability. A prospective pharmacokinetic study shows that taking a 3000-mg dose of rebaudioside A results in an average peak serum concentration of 178 ng/mL after 2 hours. Average peak serum concentrations of steviol, a microbial metabolite of rebaudioside A, and steviol glucuronide, the hepatic metabolite of steviol, were 119 ng/mL and 3441 ng/mL, respectively, and occurred at 19.5 hours (110125).\nMetabolism\nThe stevia constituent stevioside does not appear to be metabolized in the stomach (76332). Instead, the steviol glycosides, including stevioside and various rebaudiosides, are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to steviol (11809, 11811, 76314, 76320, 76332, 106456). Steviol is conjugated in the liver to steviol glucuronide, and is the primary circulating metabolite after consumption of rebaudioside A or stevioside (110125).\nExcretion\nSteviol glycosides, including stevioside and various rebaudiosides, are eliminated in the feces (11809, 11811, 76332). Steviol glucuronide is excreted in urine (110125).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of stevia is the leaf. It contains steviol glycosides, which are responsible for the sweet properties of the plant. The steviol glycosides include stevioside and rebaudiosides A and C. Stevioside and rebaudioside A are non-caloric, heat and acid stable, and 200-300 times sweeter than sucrose (11809, 11811, 16700, 16701, 16703, 76383). Stevia also contains the phytosterols, stigmasterol (45.8%), beta-sitosterol (39.4%), and campesterol (13.1%) (76384), as well as flavonoids, such as quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, and their glycosides (76345), and diterpenes and their glycosides (76361, 76366).\nAnti-cancer effects\nStevia and stevioside might have some activity against human colon carcinoma cells. High doses appear to decrease cell viability in vitro. They also attenuate tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated interleukin-8 production, as well as the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta (16704, 76331). In animal models, stevioside and other stevia constituents, appear to inhibit carcinogenesis (76313, 76336).\n\nHowever, there has also been some controversy about potential mutagenic activity of stevia constituents. Based on laboratory research, stevioside has shown no evidence of mutagenic, genotoxic, antifertility, or teratogenic effects (11811). However, steviol has been shown to have dose-dependent mutagenic effects using some bacterial assays (3748, 3749). However, this was not reproduced in another assay using bacteria with normal DNA repair processes. Therefore, the majority of evidence suggests that stevia constituents do not have genotoxic effects (16701).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn vitro, stevioside and steviol, stimulate insulin secretion via a direct action on beta cells (5032, 76309, 76316, 76329). Steviol might also inhibit gastrointestinal absorption of glucose (5035). In other animal research models, stevia and stevioside decrease fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance, increase insulin sensitivity, improve skeletal muscle glucose transport, and regulate inflammation involved in diabetes pathogenesis (11813, 106459, 113007, 116752). Stevioside also increases hepatic glycogen synthesis in animal models, possibly by activating peripheral mu-opioid receptors (3750, 76341). Additionally, in an animal model of type 1 diabetes, stevia extract decreases the number of circulating CD8+ T cells, which are involved in pancreatic beta cell destruction, and reduces levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta (116752).\n\nHowever, results of studies in humans are mixed. In one small clinical study in healthy adults, an aqueous stevia leaf extract has been shown to increase glucose tolerance and reduce plasma glucose levels (3301). Conversely, a small clinical study in the same population shows that twice daily consumption of an aqueous stevia leaf extract (SweetLeaf) for 12 weeks does not affect glucose homeostasis or insulin response following an oral glucose tolerance test (106458). Small clinical studies in adults with insulin resistance or diabetes show that stevia or its constituent rebaudioside A do not affect levels of glucose, insulin, or serum C-peptide, which is a marker for insulin production, when compared with water or placebo (110124, 110125). Other clinical research in patients with diabetes has yielded conflicting results regarding the effect of stevia constituents on blood glucose levels (11812, 16705).\nAntimicrobial effects\nStevia might have antibacterial effects. In vitro, a fermented aqueous extract of stevia is bactericidal against many food-borne pathogenic bacteria including E. coli 0157:H7 (3300). In laboratory research, stevia extract has also shown activity against Staphylococcus aureus (76394). Stevioside and steviol have shown toxic effects against Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 (76391).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal models of diabetes, stevia extracts have demonstrated antioxidant effects including increasing serum levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and reducing tissue levels of glutathione malondialdehyde (MDA) l (106459, 113007).\nBlood pressure effects\nClinical trials have shown that taking stevioside reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals with moderate hypertension (11809, 11810). Research in animal models suggests that stevioside might act as a calcium channel blocker (11809, 11811, 76308). Also, stevia extract and stevioside have vasodilating and diuretic activity in rats (3746, 3747, 76308).\nDiuretic effects\nStevia extract and stevioside have shown diuretic activity in rats (3746, 3747, 5033, 76308).\nLipid effects\nIn animal models of diabetes, stevia extracts, decrease total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (106459, 113007).\nReproductive effects\nSome preliminary evidence suggests that stevia might adversely affect reproduction. An aqueous stevia extract reduced sperm production and testis weight in male rats (5033). Steviol fed to female hamsters reduced the number and birth weight of offspring (5036). However, some research has found no effect on reproduction (16700), while other animal research found stevia extract improves markers of male fertility, including testosterone levels and sperm count (113008).\nWeight loss effects\nIn a rat model of diabetes, an aqueous stevia leaf extract, alone and in combination with saxagliptin, decreases body weight and food and water intake when compared with a diabetic control (106459). However, the results of studies with stevia in humans are conflicting. While some clinical research suggests that stevia may increase feelings of satiety and fullness and reduce appetite and subsequent ad libitum energy intake, other small clinical studies have not shown this (103696, 103697, 106458, 110124, 113005)."

Both the root and leaf are used for medicinal purposes. It was used as a diuretic and laxative during the ancient period of the Greek physicians Dioscorides and Galen (76447). It is listed in the European pharmacopoeia and is used as a wild edible plant in soups and other preparations (39801).",

Usually, short exposure to stinging nettle results in a transient urticarial reaction and a stinging sensation which may persist for more than 12 hours (76399, 76414, 76417, 96746). In one report, a patient placed a fresh stinging nettle leaf on the tongue to suck out the sap of the leaf. Severe tongue edema, pain, and urticaria developed within 5 minutes. Symptoms continued for several hours after the leaf was removed (15197). In another case report, a young couple intoxicated with methamphetamine fell and laid in a stinging nettle bush for 20 minutes, after which urticaria and pain continued for 2-3 weeks, and a heightened sensitivity to cold persisted for several months (96746).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case of gynecomastia has been reported for a 33-year-old male who consumed stinging nettle tea 2 cups daily for one month prior to symptom onset. The condition subsided one month after discontinuing stinging nettle tea (76410).\n\nThere have been two cases of galactorrhea associated with the consumption of stinging nettle for one month (76410, 108902). In one case, a 33-year-old female consuming stinging nettle tea showed high levels of estradiol and low levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The levels of these hormones normalized 6 weeks after discontinuing stinging nettle tea (76410). In the other case report describing a 30-year-old female self-treating with stinging nettle 500 mg daily, hormone levels were not reported; however, a mammogram showed scattered areas of fibroglandular density and benign-appearing calcifications. This patient had complete resolution of symptoms 1 week after discontinuation of stinging nettle (108902).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, stinging nettle root can cause gastrointestinal complaints, including diarrhea and constipation (1, 7, 11230). Stinging nettle above ground parts may cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort when taken on an empty stomach (7035). Stinging nettle juice may cause diarrhea (1). One patient taking a combination product containing stinging nettle root extract and pygeum bark extract (Prostatonin, Pharmaton) experienced continual gastrointestinal pain and hyperperistalsis. It is not clear if this effect was due to stinging nettle or pygeum (70230).\nless\nGenitourinary\nThere is a case report of decreased ejaculatory volume associated with an herbal blend product containing stinging nettle root extract, saw palmetto extract, pumpkin seed oil extract, lemon bioflavonoid extract, and beta-carotene (5093).

Remarkable laboratory values included elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. The patient received a loading dose of N-acetylcysteine and was hospitalized for 12 days (112178).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral stinging nettle seems to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 8 small heterogeneous clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking stinging nettle 1.5-10 grams in divided doses daily for 8-12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) by 18 mg/dL when compared with placebo (102865). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was not improved, but the study durations were not adequate to detect an improvement in this measure. Despite positive results on FBG, taking stinging nettle does not seem to improve insulin secretion or measures of insulin sensitivity (91519, 102865, 108903). Another meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking stinging nettle reduces HbA1c by about 1.3% when compared with placebo. This analysis also suggests stinging nettle reduces post-prandial blood glucose by about 114 mg/dL; however, this is based on a single study. Stinging nettle did not improve fasting blood glucose or insulin resistance in this analysis (111503). The validity of these findings is limited by the low quality and heterogeneity of included studies, as well as unclear dosing. Furthermore, since most research has been conducted in Iran, it is unknown if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\n\nStinging nettle has also been used in combination with other natural medicines. One small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a product containing stinging nettle leaf extract 200 mg, milk thistle 200 mg, and Boswellia serrata gum 200 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces FBP by about 28 mg/dL and HbA1c by about 1.5%, compared with a smaller reduction in the placebo group (96742). It is unclear if this effect is due to stinging nettle, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial for hay fever.\nTaking stinging nettle leaf extract 300 mg 3-7 times daily at the first sign of hay fever symptoms seems to provide subjective improvement (7035). However, adding stinging nettle to conventional allergy medication might not provide any additional benefit. One small clinical study shows that adding stinging nettle tablets (Urtidin, Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Co.) 150 mg four times daily for 1 month to treatment with loratadine and nasal saline rinses does not improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis when compared with placebo with loratadine and nasal saline rinses (96743).\nless\nAnemia. Although there is interest in using oral stinging nettle for anemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of stinging nettle for this condition.\nAsthma. Although there is interest in using oral stinging nettle for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of stinging nettle for this condition.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial for BPH.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research, including 5 clinical studies and 1,128 patients with BPH, shows that taking stinging nettle root extract 360-600 mg in divided doses daily for 2-12 months improves peak urinary flow rate and symptom scores while modestly reducing prostate volume when compared with control. However, the validity of these results is limited by significant heterogeneity due to the variability in the products used and the specific endpoints investigated (96744). In the largest clinical trial in the analysis, patients took stinging nettle root extract 120 mg three times daily for 6 months (76406).\n\nStinging nettle has also been evaluated in combination products. Clinical research in patients with BPH shows that taking a specific combination product (PRO 160/120, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) containing a specific extract of stinging nettle root (WS 1031) 120 mg plus a specific extract of saw palmetto fruit (WS 1473) 160 mg twice daily for 24-48 weeks seems to improve urinary tract symptoms when compared with control; the effect may last at least 48 weeks after treatment (15195, 15551, 76409). However, taking a different combination product does not seem to be beneficial. A small clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking a product containing stinging nettle root extract 240 mg, saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, lemon bioflavonoid, and beta-carotene, three times daily for 6 months, does not improve symptoms of BPH (5093).\nless\nBleeding. Topical stinging nettle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that applying 4 mL of a specific product (Ankaferd blood stopper, Mefar Ilaç Sanayi A.S) containing alpinia, licorice, thyme, stinging nettle, and common grape vine to the affected area reduces bleeding, but does not improve the time for episiotomy repair, when compared with using saline (31010).\nless\nGingivitis. Stinging nettle in a mouthwash solution has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate gingival inflammation suggests that using 10 mL of mouthwash solution containing a 1:1:1 mixture of stinging nettle, juniper, and yarrow twice daily for 3 months does not reduce plaque or bleeding when compared with control (76443). It is not clear if this effect is due to stinging nettle, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGout. Although there is interest in using oral stinging nettle for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of stinging nettle for this condition.\nGulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial for Gulf war syndrome.\nA very small exploratory clinical trial in males with Gulf war syndrome shows that taking stinging nettle leaf (Nature's Way) 1305 mg in two divided doses daily for 30 days modestly improves symptom severity when compared with placebo (108311). The clinical relevance of this finding is limited by the use of an unvalidated scoring scale. Additionally, it appears that most patients had mild, unspecified symptoms at baseline; it is unclear if stinging nettle is beneficial for moderate to severe symptoms.\nless\nHyperandrogenism. It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial in patients with hyperandrogenism.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with hyperandrogenism shows that taking dried extract of stinging nettle root 300-600 mg daily for approximately 4 months decreases total and free testosterone levels, but not menstrual cycle conditions, oily skin, or acne, when compared with taking spironolactone and cyproterone (91520).\nless\nInsect bite. Oral stinging nettle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a homeopathic after-bite gel, containing stinging nettle, Echinacea, and marsh Labrador tea, on affected areas does not reduce erythema or itching after a mosquito bite when compared with placebo (89235).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral stinging nettle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with kidney stones sized 10 mm or less shows that taking a combination product containing stinging nettle, tribulus, corn silk and other ingredients (standardized to 1.2 mg phenolic content per mL), 60 drops orally three times daily, for 4 weeks reduces stone size and improves expulsion rate when compared with placebo. Complete stone expulsion occurred in 45% of those receiving the combination product compared with 15% in the placebo group (115666). It is unclear if this effect is due to stinging nettle, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMyalgia. Although there is interest in using topical stinging nettle for myalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of stinging nettle for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. Small clinical studies suggest that topical stinging nettle may modestly improve pain in patients with osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial.\nTopically, stinging nettle leaf may have a counterirritant effect which may improve osteoarthritis pain in some patients. A small clinical study in patients ages 45-82 with osteoarthritis of the thumb shows that applying raw stinging nettle leaf to the thumb for 30 seconds daily for 1 week reduces pain and disability when compared with white dead nettle leaf control (12490). However, in another small clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis, topical application of raw stinging nettle leaf to the knee for 1 minute daily for 7 days does not seem to be more effective for reducing pain than applying a leaf from a related stingless nettle (76412). Non-raw stinging nettle has also been tried. In a small open-label study, a formulation of stinging nettle extract (Liquid PhytoCaps Nettle Leaf, Gaia Herbs) 13.33% compounded with lipobase oil-in-water emulsion and applied to the affected area twice daily for 2 weeks, modestly improves pain and function in patients with radiologically confirmed osteoarthritis when compared with baseline (76414). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nStinging nettle has also been evaluated orally, in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific combination solution (Rosaxan, medAgil Gesundheitsgesellschaft mbH) containing stinging nettle extract 160 mg, rose hip puree 20 grams, devil's claw 108 mg, and vitamin D 200 IU daily for 12 weeks improves symptoms by an additional 28% and pain scores by an additional 33% when compared with placebo (96741). It is unclear if this effect is due to stinging nettle, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if oral stinging nettle is beneficial for acute pain.\nA small clinical trial in adults undergoing endodontic treatment of pulpitis shows that taking a specific stinging nettle leaf extract (Barij Netonal, Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company) 400 mg orally once 30 minutes prior to the procedure improves pain scores at 8,12, and 24 hours after the procedure similarly to ibuprofen 400 mg and to a greater extent than placebo (115667).\nless\nTinnitus. Oral stinging nettle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with tinnitus shows that taking a specific product containing stinging nettle, tansy, and rose hip (Neurotec, Rose Pharmed), 100 mg orally daily for 3 months does not improve auditory thresholds when compared with placebo. However, the product improved some subjective symptoms scores, such as perceived loudness and severity scores (110512).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of stinging nettle are the above ground parts and root. Stinging nettle root contains polysaccharides and fatty acids, including (10E,12Z)-9-Hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (11227, 11228, 11229, 76466). Stinging nettle leaf contains several nutrients and active constituents. The leaf is eaten as a food because of significant amounts carotene, vitamin C, vitamin K, potassium, calcium, and magnesium (2, 8, 11, 19, 76425). There is about as much vitamin C and carotene in stinging nettle leaf as in spinach and other greens (5). The leaf also contains beta-sitosterol and the flavonoids quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, and others. The leaf also contains lectins, including agglutinin (76448). The stinging nettle hairs of the leaf contain histamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin (12490, 76420, 76448).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests applying stinging nettle leaf topically might relieve arthritis pain by hyperstimulation, but the exact mechanism for this effect is unknown (12490).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFor osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, stinging nettle above ground parts might work due to potential anti-inflammatory effects (6500, 12490). Preliminary clinical research shows that stinging nettle extract lowers levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in humans (76422). Animal research shows that polysaccharides from stinging nettle root extract can reduce inflammation by stimulating T-lymphocyte proliferation, influencing the complementary system, or increasing the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (76464). Cell culture research shows that stinging nettle root extract may suppress human leukocyte elastase (HLE), a proteinase involved in tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammation (76403). Other cell culture research shows that stinging nettle leaf extract inhibits phytohemagglutinin-stimulated production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma (76400), reduces lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (76437), and inhibits NF-kappaB activation (76444).\nAntiallergy effects\nSome researchers think that stinging nettle leaf might be beneficial for allergic rhinitis due to its quercetin content. Quercetin is thought to have anti-inflammatory and mast-cell stabilizing effects. It decreases histamine release from basophils and mast cells (483). In clinical research, taking stinging nettle daily for 1 month reduced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels compared to placebo. However, stinging nettle did not alter clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis, nasal smear eosinophil levels, or serum levels of IgE, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or interleukin-5 (IL-5), (96743).\nAnticancer effects\nAgglutinin, a lectin derived from stinging nettle root, has been shown to inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptor in epidermoid carcinoma cells (76467). Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling plays a role in the cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.\nAntifungal effects\nCell culture research shows that lectins isolated from stinging nettle root extracts have fungistatic effects (76408, 76446).\nAntiviral effects\nCell culture research shows that lectins from stinging nettle can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A virus replication (76404). Other cell culture research shows that stinging nettle agglutinin can prevent the entry of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) into target cells (76411).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that giving an extract of stinging nettle above ground parts intravenously can reduce blood pressure via diuretic and natriuretic effects (76402). Also, the leaf juice can increase urine output and slightly decrease systolic blood pressure and body weight in people with venous insufficiency (1, 11).\nCNS effects\nStinging nettle seems to lower body temperature, and have CNS depressant and anti-seizure activity (4, 6, 11).\nHypoglycemic effects\nSome cell culture and animal research shows that stinging nettle leaf can increase the secretion of insulin from the pancreas (93100). Other cell culture research shows that stinging nettle leaf extract can inhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activity (94101). Additional cell culture research shows that stinging nettle above ground parts can inhibit alpha-glucosidase activity (94102, 94103).\nLactation effects\nThere is interest in using stinging nettle to stimulate breast milk production. A very small clinical trial in lactating adults in Iran shows that taking stinging nettle 15 drops orally three times daily for 4 weeks improves infant feeding frequency, the number of wet diapers, defecation frequency, and diaper weight when compared with placebo drops (115676). However, milk production was not measured and it is unclear if the people in the study had lactation insufficiency prior to enrollment.\nProstate-related effects\nThere is interest in using stinging nettle for prostate disease, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Preliminary research shows that an aqueous extract of stinging nettle leaves can decrease adenosine deaminase activity in prostate tissue from patients with localized prostate cancer (15196). Animal and cell culture research shows that stinging nettle root extract can reduce the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (11227, 76398). In vitro research shows that lignans from stinging nettle root interfere with the binding of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (11228). The binding of DHT and SHBG stimulates the growth of prostate cancer (93099). By interfering with this binding, stinging nettle is believed to reduce prostate cancer growth.\n\nStinging nettle root extract also appears to inhibit the binding of SHBG to its receptor on the surface of prostate cells. By interfering with the binding of SHBG to its receptor, stinging nettle root extract may prevent estrogen-induced amplification of the androgen signal, which is thought to promote hyperplasia (76435).\n\nStinging nettle contains beta-sitosterol (15196). Laboratory research suggests beta-sitosterol might have antiproliferative effects on the prostate, possibly by inhibiting growth factors (11234). In animals, beta-sitosterol shrinks the prostate, but this has not been shown in humans (11759). Some preliminary evidence also shows that extracts of stinging nettle can inhibit prostate tissue growth (15196).\n\nAromatase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Estrogens appear to be involved in the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therefore, inhibition of aromatase could improve BPH (76465). Some constituents of the methanol extract of stinging nettle root demonstrated weak-to-moderate aromatase inhibition (76403, 76447, 76461, 76466).\n\nThere is also some preliminary research showing that stinging nettle can inhibit 5-alpha reductase enzyme (76461). This enzyme is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, other preliminary research shows that stinging nettle root extract does not inhibit 5-alpha reductase (70232).\n\nPreliminary research shows that stinging nettle root extract inhibits the sodium-potassium pump in human prostatic hyperplastic tissue (76434, 76447). Inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump may reduce prostate cell metabolism and growth (76434)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Pooled analyses of clinical research show that taking freeze-dried strawberry powder or eating fresh strawberries for 3-12 weeks can reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation and risk factor for CVD, by 0.47-0.63 mg/L when compared with placebo. These analyses report conflicting effects on blood pressure and lipid levels (103881, 103882), with one analysis reporting small improvements that are not clinically significant (103881). It is unclear whether strawberry can prevent CVD or related outcomes.\nDiabetes. Preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking freeze-dried strawberry powder 50 grams daily for 6 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.47% compared to an increase of 0.15% with placebo. However, there were no changes in serum glucose, anthropometric measurements, blood lipids, or blood pressure. Also, the short duration of supplementation makes it unclear whether the change in HbA1c was due to strawberry (100113, 100119).\nHyperlipidemia. Data on the effects of strawberry on serum lipids are conflicting. Clinical research in adults with abdominal obesity and elevated serum lipids shows that taking freeze-dried strawberry powder 50 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with either placebo or taking 25 grams of freeze-dried strawberry daily. In those taking 50 grams daily, levels of LDL cholesterol decreased by approximately 21% from baseline, compared with a 2% reduction in those taking placebo. However, strawberry did not improve levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides (100109). Another study also reported reduced levels of total and LDL cholesterol (112318), while others report no changes in any lipid levels (112320, 112321). In a meta-analysis, strawberry was associated with mean decreases of 11 mg/dL in LDL levels, and 12 mg/dL in total cholesterol, as well as increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (112323).\nHypertension. Preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal women with pre- or stage I hypertension shows that taking freeze-dried strawberry powder 25 or 50 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo.

Similarly, preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese shows that taking freeze-dried strawberry powder 50 grams daily for 6 weeks does not improve weight loss when compared with placebo (100113). Evidence from mainly small, lower-quality studies is mixed as to whether taking strawberries has beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors when compared to control in obese individuals (100109, 100116, 100118).\nOsteoarthritis.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with strawberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral consumption of strawberries, plasma levels of anthocyanins peak after 2-4 hours. Absorption is highest in the fasted state (100117). Plasma levels of ellagic acid and enterolactone also increase after consumption of strawberry (76470, 100109, 100116). Serum levels of vitamin C and folate are elevated from 0.5 to 4 hours after strawberry ingestion, with peak levels occurring at 2 hours (112317).\nMetabolism\nAfter oral intake of strawberry fruit, conjugation of anthocyanins, urolithin derivatives, and phenolic acid metabolites is observed. Pelargonidin glucuronide is found in the highest levels (100115, 100117).\nExcretion\nMetabolites of anthocyanins are excreted in urine after intake of strawberry. Most are excreted within 4 hours (76479). Enterolactone is also excreted (76470).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of strawberry are the leaf and fruit. Strawberry contains anthocyanidins, ellagitannins, catechins, phenolic acids, and flavonols, such as quercetin and kaempferol. Other constituents include ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, chlorogenic acid, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (13532, 13533, 100111). The contents of the fruit and leaves vary with maturity (13533). Processing methods such as heating, fermenting, and pasteurizing can reduce the antioxidant capacity of anthocyanidins, ellagic acid, and other polyphenols in strawberry fruit (13631, 13632).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nHuman evidence suggests that strawberry might help with glycemic control (100113, 100119). Taking strawberry before a meal reduces the postprandial rise in glucose levels, possibly by a mechanism involving improved insulin sensitivity (100112). However, improvements in postprandial glucose and insulin levels have not been shown in all studies (100114).\nAnti-inflammatory properties\nIn human research, strawberry has been shown to reduce pain associated with osteoarthritis (100116). A possible mechanism of action is inhibition of circulating inflammatory biomarkers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and lipid peroxides (100110, 100112, 100113, 100116). In adults with metabolic syndrome, ingestion of freeze-dried strawberry powder, 32 grams daily for 4 weeks, is associated with reduced levels of the acute phase protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is released in the presence of acute inflammation (112321).\nAnticancer activity\nPreliminary research suggests the free radical scavenging effects of strawberries might inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and inhibit carcinogenesis (13634, 13635).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn healthy young females, ingesting 500 grams of strawberry puree results in lengthening of the lag time for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol oxygenation to occur (112317).\nBone effects\nIn postmenopausal females, consuming freeze-dried strawberry powder orally, 12.5 or 25 grams twice daily for 8 weeks, is associated with small changes in markers of bone formation and bone resorption when compared with placebo. Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor, which plays a role in bone formation, are increased, as are levels of adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory molecule with bone-protective effects. There is no change in levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b, which are markers of bone formation and resorption respectively (112322).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn obese adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia, taking freeze-dried strawberry powder, 25 grams twice daily for 4 weeks, is associated with a 15% increase in flow-mediated dilation 1 hour after a dose, and reduced systolic blood pressure 2 hours after a dose, when compared with placebo. The improvements in endothelial function are associated with changes in levels of phenolic metabolites in the blood (112320).\nCognitive effects\nIn healthy, physically fit adults aged 60-75 years, consuming freeze-dried strawberry powder orally, 12 grams twice daily for 90 days, is associated with shorter latencies in a virtual spatial navigation task, and increased word recognition in the California Verbal Learning Test, when compared with placebo (112319).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn healthy adults, ingesting freeze-dried strawberry powder, 13 grams twice daily for 4 weeks, increases levels of gut microorganisms which are associated with lean body weight, health, and longevity. This may be due to the fiber and polyphenols present in strawberries. Bacterial families that increase in abundance include Christensenellaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Mogibacteraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae. There is a decrease in Alcaligenaceae and Sutterella. These changes are not maintained 2 weeks after stopping strawberry ingestion (112324).\nMetabolic effects\nIn adults with metabolic syndrome, consuming freeze-dried strawberry powder, 32 grams orally daily for 4 weeks, is associated with lower serum levels of the branched-chain amino acids valine and leucine, when compared with placebo or a lower strawberry dose of 13 grams daily. Levels of these amino acids, which are involved in energy and glucose metabolism, are elevated in metabolic syndrome. High-dose strawberry ingestion is also associated with decreased fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance, but no change in fasting glucose or body weight (112318, 112321). Improvements in insulin resistance may be due to increases in propionic acids, produced by colonic degradation of strawberry polyphenols (112318). The anthocyanins present in strawberries can impede cholesteryl ester transfer protein, resulting in decreased formation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and also decreases in very low density. and intermediate density lipoproteins (112323). However, data on the clinical effects of strawberry on serum lipids are conflicting (112320, 112321). A meta-analysis shows that strawberry is associated with mean decreases of 11 mg/dL in LDL cholesterol, and 12 mg/dL in total cholesterol, as well as increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This meta-analysis also reports no change in fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, or oxidized LDL levels, and no change in blood pressure or body mass index (112323).\nNeurological effects\nPreliminary research suggests that compounds contained in strawberry fruit might slow the effects of aging on the nervous system (1418, 1419). Strawberry might protect against oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage, which is characteristic of Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases (13633)."

            "Overview": "Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid-producing bacteria. Strains of S. thermophilus are used extensively in the manufacture of fermented dairy products. In supplements, S. thermophilus is often used in combination with other bacteria as a probiotic (102434).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using Streptococcus thermophilus for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, Streptococcus thermophilus is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with other probiotic strains has been safely used in clinical trials lasting up to one year (162, 1233, 1731, 3261, 6087, 11379, 12769, 14370, 14371, 16740, 102440).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with other probiotic species has been used with apparent safety in children of most ages for up to one year (161, 3169, 16841, 90241, 102426, 102436, 111106). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Streptococcus thermophilus in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. A combination of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been used with apparent safety for 8 weeks starting at 24-28 weeks gestation (96892).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nStreptococcus thermophilus is well tolerated. Serious adverse effects have not been reported in clinical research.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that probiotics may cause infections in some people.\nImmunologic\nSince many probiotic preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathogenic infection in some patients. Bacteremia and sepsis have been reported in patients with indwelling or central venous catheters or patients who are severely ill and/or immunocompromised, including preterm infants, that were using probiotic products (4380, 8561, 13008, 13070, 90298, 102416, 103444, 105138, 105140, 105141)(107543, 107597, 107599, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). However, reports of pathogenic colonization in relatively healthy patients with intact immune systems who do not have indwelling or central venous catheters are extremely rare (4380, 4389, 4390, 4391, 4393, 4398, 105139, 107543, 107545, 107546)(107547).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in hospitalized adults shows that consuming a 97 mL drink (Actimel, Danone) containing S. thermophilus 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL, Lacticaseibacillus casei 100 CFUs/mL, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 10 million CFUs/mL twice daily while taking antibiotics reduces the odds of developing AAD by 75% when compared with a milkshake without probiotics (16740). However, a meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults, including the study above, shows that taking S. thermophilus in combination with 2-7 other probiotic strains does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with placebo (107635). The validity of these findings is limited by the high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including variations in the study populations, study durations, and probiotic combinations assessed.\n\nThe use of a combination product containing S. thermophilus has also been studied in infants 6-26 months of age. A small clinical study in these patients shows that taking a formula containing S. thermophilus 1 million CFUs and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 10 million CFUs daily for 15 days reduces the risk of AAD by 48% when compared with taking regular formula (102427).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Intravaginal Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with recurrent bacterial vaginosis shows that using a specific probiotic capsule (Probaclac Vaginal, Nicar Laboratories, Inc) containing S. thermophilus 0.8 billion stabilized lactic ferments, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 6.8 billion stabilized lactic ferments, and Lactobacillus acidophilus 0.4 billion stabilized lactic ferments intravaginally once daily for two one-week periods, with a one week rest period in between, reduces the odds of bacterial vaginosis recurrence by 77% when compared with control (102438).\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral Streptococcus thermophilus is beneficial for improving child growth.\nA preliminary clinical study in malnourished children ages 6 months to 3 years shows that consuming a powdered milk formula with S. thermophilus and Bifidobacteria bifidum Bb12 400-600 mL daily for 6 months does not impact weight or height when compared with the same formula with B. bifidum Bb12 alone (102434). The validity of this study was limited by short duration and variability in the children's age.\nless\nColic. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with colic shows that receiving a synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion colony-forming units total of S. thermophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium breve, as well as fructo-oligosaccharides (Protexin Healthcare) daily for 30 days reduces daily crying by 50% or more in 87% of infants, compared with an average 46% reduction in the placebo group (102430).\nless\nConstipation. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with functional constipation or constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome shows that taking a 26-gram chocolate supplement containing S. thermophilus MG510 300 million colony-forming units (CFUs)/gram and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LRCC5193 100 million CFUs/gram daily for 4 weeks does not increase bowel movements when compared with placebo. However, it may modestly improve stool consistency (102440).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, retrospective study in patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms suggests that taking a combination of probiotics in addition to standard treatments modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea when compared with standard treatments alone. The probiotic treatment consisted of S. thermophilus 6 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 6 million CFUs, and Bifidobacterium longum 60 million CFUs, given in three divided doses daily (107200).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (Familact probiotics, ZistTakhmir Co.) containing S. thermophilus and other probiotic bacteria daily for 6 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose or plasma insulin levels when compared with placebo. This product contains S. thermophilus 1.5 billion colony forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus 2 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus casei 7 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1.5 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 200 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium breve 30 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium longum 7 billion CFUs (99790). Other clinical research in adults with diabetes shows that taking a combination of S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 12 weeks does not reduce levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo (107521).\n\nHowever, S. thermophilus in combination with other probiotics might be beneficial for gestational diabetes. A small clinical study in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking a total of 4 billion CFUs of a freeze-dried combination of S. thermophilus STY-31, L. acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LBY-27 for 8 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and improves insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (96892). Also, other clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking a specific product containing S. thermophilus and other probiotics (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) as a total of 112.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect levels of fasting blood glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo. However, there were small improvements in insulin levels and insulin resistance (107549).\n\nA combination probiotic containing S. thermophilus has also been evaluated in children 2-12 years of age with new-onset type 1 diabetes. One clinical study shows that taking Visbiome as 112.5 billion CFUs daily for 3 months modestly decreases HbA1c and insulin requirements when compared with placebo. Also, about three times as many children achieved remission, which was defined as insulin requirements of less than 0.5 U/kg daily and HbA1c of less than 7%. However, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected when compared with placebo (107497).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy who are not taking antidiabetes drugs shows that taking a combination of S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the ratio of microalbuminuria/creatinine (mAlb/Cr), a marker of kidney damage, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (107521).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in children aged 3-36 months with acute diarrhea shows that taking a combination probiotic (Lactogermina) containing 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each of S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, plus 500 million CFUs of Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 5 days, in addition to oral rehydration solution, reduces the duration of diarrhea by 37 hours when compared with oral rehydration solution alone (102426). In addition, a small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing S. thermophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium breve daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417). It is unclear if these effects are due to S. thermophilus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nS. thermophilus has also been evaluated for the prevention of acute diarrhea. A large clinical trial in infants aged 4-6 months shows that taking a fermented formula containing S. thermophilus and Bifidobacterium breve daily for 5 months does not reduce the risk of acute diarrhea or hospitalization for diarrhea, nor does it improve the duration of diarrhea episodes when compared with standard infant formula. However, infants receiving this probiotic had less severe episodes of diarrhea, required fewer medical consultations and prescriptions for oral rehydration solution, and had a lower risk of dehydration (111106). It is unclear if these effects are due to S. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in resistance-trained males shows that taking S. thermophilus FP4 and Bifidobacterium breve BR03 10 billion colony-forming units total daily for 3 weeks prior to resistance training modestly attenuates range of motion decrements following resistance training, but does not improve range of motion, muscle soreness, or exercise recovery, when compared with placebo (95415).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn adults with H. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease, adding a combination product containing seven strains of probiotics (Balance by Protexin Co), including S. thermophilus, daily for 14 days to quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth subcitrate, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin does not improve H. pylori eradication or symptoms when compared with quadruple therapy alone (90291).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children ages 2-12 years with HIV shows that receiving a specific probiotic formula (NAN2 probiotico, Nestle) containing a total of 25 billion colony-forming units of S. thermophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 2 months modestly increases CD4 counts, but does not reduce diarrhea, when compared with a standard formula (102436).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nProducts containing S. thermophilus and other probiotics (Duolac Care; LacClean Gold-S, Cell Biotech, Co. Ltd) as a total of 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 4 weeks have shown some benefit in adults with IBS (95353, 102439). S. thermophilus-containing probiotics also seem to help specifically in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Duolac Care contains S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum 10 billion CFUs and was taken twice daily for 8 weeks (102429). Other research has shown benefit with a specific product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing S. thermophilus and other probiotics taken as 450 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks (11379). However, adding this product as 900 billion CFUs daily to a sham diet or a low-FODMAP diet for 4 weeks does not improve IBS symptoms when compared with placebo (98741). Other clinical research shows that taking a specific product (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing S. thermophilus ST250, L. acidophilus LA120, L. rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lactocaseibacillus casei LC130, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, as well as B. breve BB010, B. longum BL020, B. bifidum BF030, and B. animalis subsp. lactis BL040 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as quality of life, pain severity, and pain frequency, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Also, it is unclear if oral S. thermophilus is safe for use in preterm infants.\nA network meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking a combination probiotic containing S. thermophilus TH-4, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis Bb-02, and Bifidobacterium animalis sups. Lactis Bb-12 reduces the risk of NEC by 71% when compared with control (102437). It is unclear if these effects are due to S. thermophilus, the other ingredients, or the combination. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a total of 500 million colony-forming units of S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus daily for 3 months modestly reduces liver enzyme levels when compared to baseline (102424). This study was limited by a lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. Another small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a specific product (VSL#3) containing S. thermophilus and seven other probiotic strains, two sachets each morning for 3 months, modestly reduces liver enzyme levels and measures of hepatic steatosis when compared with placebo (111105). It is unclear if these findings are due to S. thermophilus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small open-label clinical trial in patients with NASH shows that taking a combination probiotic containing a total of 100 million colony-forming units of S. thermophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium longum, plus fructo-oligosaccharides once daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces liver stiffness and alanine aminotransferase, but does not affect steatosis or other liver enzyme levels, when compared with control (102415).\nless\nOral mucositis. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with Candida-associated oral mucositis shows that, in addition to topical antifungal therapy, taking four 500-mg lozenges, with each lozenge containing S. thermophilus 500,000 colony-forming units (CFUs), Bifidobacterium longum 5 million CFUs, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 500,000 CFUs, three times daily for 4 weeks does not reduce symptoms to a greater extent than topical antifungal therapy alone (102432).\nless\nOtitis media. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in children 7-13 months of age with a recent history of otitis media shows that taking a combination of S. thermophilus NCC 2496 10 million colony-forming units (CFUs)/gram, Streptococcus salivarius DSM 13084 25 million CFUs/gram, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LPR CGMCC 1.3724 10 million CFUs along with the prebiotics raftilose or raftiline daily for 12 months does not reduce the risk of otitis media recurrence or antibiotic use when compared with regular formula alone (90241).\nless\nPouchitis. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that continuous oral treatment for one year with a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing S. thermophilus and other probiotics, 300-500 billion live bacteria per gram, for up to 12 months seems to maintain remission in 85% of patients with pouchitis (6087, 12769).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in hospitalized infants shows that giving S. thermophilus 14 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily with Bifidobacterium BB-12 100 or 190 million CFUs daily, either for 8 months or the duration of hospital stay, reduces the incidence of diarrhea and rotavirus shedding (161, 3169).\nless\nSepsis. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in very preterm infants shows that taking a probiotic combination containing 1 billion colony-forming units of S. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis does not reduce mortality or late-onset sepsis when compared with placebo (102428).\nless\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with SIBO shows that taking a specific combination probiotic (Duolac Gold, Cell Biotech Co., Ltd) containing S. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 5 billion colony-forming units in lyophilized powder form daily for 4 weeks reduces SIBO and gastrointestinal symptoms when compared with placebo (102431).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Streptococcus thermophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nResearch shows that taking combination probiotics containing S. thermophilus might increase remission rates in patients with ulcerative colitis. The best evidence of benefit is for a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma). Doses of 3 grams (equivalent to 900 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) once or twice daily have been used in combination with conventional treatment. In children aged 1-16 years, doses of 450-1800 billion CFUs for up to one year have been used (3261, 14370, 14371, 16841, 95337). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking this product as an adjunct to standard ulcerative colitis treatment can increase remissions rates in adults and children with ulcerative colitis by about 1.7-fold when compared with standard treatment alone (95337). There is also evidence that it is beneficial for improving remission rates in patients who do not adequately respond to conventional treatment (14371).

    "Strontium": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Strontium is an element found in the human body and nature (94003). It has four known stable forms and 12 known radioactive isotopes (11399). In the human body, more than 99% of strontium is stored in the bone and teeth. Strontium is physically and chemically similar to calcium, readily substitutes for calcium, and has a strong affinity for bone (11396, 94003).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed orally in food amounts. Strontium has not been linked to toxicity when consumed in dietary amounts, which are typically about 0.5-1.5 mg daily (14554, 14560). ...when strontium-89 chloride is used intravenously and appropriately. Strontium-89 chloride is an FDA-approved product (4948). ...when strontium chloride is used topically and appropriately as a toothpaste. Strontium chloride hexahydrate (Sensodyne-SC) is an FDA-approved product (9).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when strontium ranelate is used orally and appropriately. Strontium ranelate 2 grams daily, providing elemental strontium 680 mg daily, seems to be safe when used for up to 10 years (11392, 11393, 11395, 14549, 94012).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Very high doses may adversely affect bone structure, although data in humans is limited (11394, 11399, 14554, 14556). Until more is known, advise patients to avoid doses of elemental strontium above 680 mg/day.\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of strontium chloride, the form most commonly used in dietary supplements, when used orally.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed orally in food amounts.

Strontium-89 chloride is a radioactive isotope which may cause fetal harm. It is FDA pregnancy risk category D; avoid using (11755). Since strontium behaves similarly to calcium in the body, strontium-89 is likely to be excreted into breast milk; avoid using during lactation (11755). There is insufficient reliable information about the safety of oral strontium when used in amounts exceeding typical dietary intake during pregnancy or lactation; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, strontium ranelate seems to be well tolerated when used in doses up to 2 grams (680 mg elemental strontium) daily, long-term.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Atopic dermatitis, diarrhea, headache, nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Myocardial infarction, osteomalacia, venous thromboembolism.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, clinical research shows that strontium ranelate increases the relative risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism by about 50% compared with placebo (14561, 14562). The reason for this is unknown. Strontium ranelate also seems to increase the risk of myocardial infarction by about 1.6-fold in patients with osteoporosis (95699).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, common side effects of strontium ranelate can include dermatitis and eczema (11392, 11393, 11395, 14549).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, strontium ranelate can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, and nausea, particularly at higher doses (14561, 76541, 94010, 94012).\nless\nHematologic\nIntravenously, strontium-89 causes bone marrow toxicity, particularly affecting platelet and white blood cell counts. Platelet levels fall by about 30% and the nadir is generally 12 to 16 weeks after injection. The effect on white blood cells is variable. Blood cell counts generally recover slowly over a period of about 6 months (11752, 11755).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nThere is some concern that doses of strontium higher than those used in clinical trials may adversely affect bone by impairing mineralization and reducing calcium absorption, leading to abnormal skeletal development and reduced bone quality (11394, 11399, 14554, 14557). This would manifest as rickets if it occurs during bone growth, and as osteomalacia after growth is complete (14556). The concern is mainly based on animal data, although strontium-related rickets has been observed in children eating plant-derived foods grown in locations with high soil strontium levels (>350 ppm), especially if they also have inadequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D intake (11399, 14554, 14556, 14557). Accumulation of strontium has also been reported in people with end-stage renal disease, especially those on dialysis, and has been linked to osteomalacia in such patients. Elevated serum and bone strontium levels seem to occur more commonly in patients with osteomalacia than in those with other types of renal osteodystrophy or no bone changes. Strontium is thought to accumulate due to reduced renal excretion and also the presence of strontium in dialysis fluids (14554, 14555, 14557, 14559).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, strontium ranelate has reportedly caused altered consciousness, memory loss, and seizures on occasion (14549).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nDental hypersensitivity. Brushing with strontium-containing toothpaste improves dental hypersensitivity.\nSeveral clinical studies show that topical use of strontium acetate 8% and strontium chloride 10% in toothpaste relieves the pain of sensitive teeth (11745, 11746, 32177, 76519, 76570, 76590). Best results are obtained with twice daily brushing (11756, 32177, 76590).\nless\nPainful bony metastases. Intravenous strontium-89 improves pain associated with bony metastases.\nSeveral clinical studies show that intravenous administration of strontium-89 chloride reduces metastatic bone pain (11749, 11750, 11751, 11752, 76608).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoporosis. Oral strontium ranelate seems to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk to a clinically significant degree in females and males with osteoporosis; however, safety concerns limit its use.\nSeveral clinical studies and a meta-analysis in postmenopausal individuals with osteoporosis show that taking strontium ranelate reduces the risk of vertebral fractures by around 40% in patients with a history of vertebral fracture. There is some evidence that it might increase BMD in these patients by 14% at the lumbar spine and 8% at the femoral neck. Taking strontium ranelate also appears to reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures by 31% (11392, 11393, 11395, 76597, 94010). In patients with or without a history of vertebral fracture, taking strontium ranelate for up to 10 years also reduces the risk of nonvertebral fractures by 15% to 38% and vertebral fractures by 24% to 35%. BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip also continues to increase over the first 5 years of treatment (76527, 76562, 94012). In postmenopausal individuals over the age of 80 years, taking strontium ranelate 2 grams daily for 4 years reduces the relative risk of vertebral fractures by 31%, nonvertebral fractures by 33%, major nonvertebral fractures by 27%, and hip fractures by 24% when compared with placebo (94011).\n\nA large clinical trial in males with osteoporosis also shows that taking strontium ranelate 2 grams daily for 2 years significantly increases lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD when compared with placebo (94002).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence about the efficacy of strontium ranelate in patients previously treated with bisphosphonates. A moderate sized clinical study in postmenopausal individuals with osteoporosis suggests that prior treatment with bisphosphonate therapy might blunt the BMD response in patients taking strontium ranelate 2 grams daily for 2 years. In bisphosphonate naïve patients, treatment with strontium lead to increases in BMD at the spine, hip, and heel. In patients with prior bisphosphonate therapy, treatment with strontium lead to increases in BMD at the spine and hip, but not the heel. (94009).\n\nBased on the benefits of strontium ranelate on BMD and fracture risk, it was approved in Europe in 2004 for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients, and later granted market authorization for males with osteoporosis. However, its use is associated with cardiac events and thromboembolism; it is therefore contraindicated in patients with a history or risk of venous thromboembolism, uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, peripheral heart disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease. Because of its limited use in patients with osteoporosis, the manufacturers of prescription strontium ranelate (Protelos) discontinued its manufacturing in August 2017 (95698). Strontium ranelate is not approved for use in the US.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Large clinical trials suggest that oral strontium ranelate is beneficial for the prevention of spinal osteoarthritis progression and the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.\nAnalysis of data from two large clinical trials in postmenopausal individuals with a history of vertebral fracture shows that taking strontium ranelate daily for 3 years appears to improve back pain and reduce the risk of spinal osteoarthritis progression by 42% when compared with placebo (76558). Additionally, two large clinical trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis show that taking strontium ranelate 1-2 grams daily for 3 years reduces joint space narrowing by 0.1-0.14 mm, improves overall symptoms and pain symptoms, and may improve stiffness and physical function when compared with placebo (94006, 94007). The dose of 2 grams daily seems to be more effective than a lower dose of 1 gram daily (94007, 94008).\nless\nProstate cancer. Some clinical research suggests that intravenous strontium-89 chloride slows the progression of prostate cancer.\nTwo clinical trials show that intravenous administration of strontium-89 chloride seems to slow the progression of treatment-resistant prostate cancer and to relieve pain associated with prostate cancer (11747, 11748). However, it appears to be less effective when compared with local radiation therapy (111748).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral strontium for metastatic cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of strontium for this purpose.\nDental caries. Although there has been interest in using oral strontium for the prevention of dental caries, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of strontium for this purpose.\nFractures. It is unclear if oral strontium is beneficial in patients with wrist fractures.\nA small clinical study in patients over 60 years of age with a wrist fracture shows that taking strontium ranelate 2 grams daily for 3 months, in addition to calcium and vitamin D, does not improve or accelerate wrist fracture healing when compared with calcium and vitamin D alone (94005).\nless\nPruritus. It is unclear if topical strontium is beneficial for the prevention of pruritus.\nA small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that topical application of strontium chloride 4% gel (TriCalm, Cosmederm Bioscience) 15 minutes prior to itch induction with cowhage reduces itch intensity and duration when compared with placebo. It also seems to decrease itch intensity more than topical hydrocortisone 1% or diphenhydramine 2% (94004).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate strontium for these uses.",

Strontium ranelate should be taken at least 2 hours before or after products containing calcium (14549). Preliminary data indicates that calcium also competitively reduces absorption of strontium gluconate (11404).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with strontium.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nStrontium is primarily absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (20-40%) and to a lesser extent by the lungs and skin. Peak plasma concentrations are found 3-5 hours after oral administration (76543, 76629). The bioavailability of strontium, specifically strontium chloride, may be reduced with food. The average bioavailability was 25% without food and 19% with food. (76629). Changes in the intestinal mucosa during pregnancy and lactation may increase absorption of alkali metals including strontium (14556).\nDistribution\nStrontium is distributed primarily in the tissues of bone and teeth (76508, 76537, 76574, 76578, 76598).\nExcretion\nStrontium (salts and isotopes) is primarily eliminated through urine, with a lesser extent in feces and sweat (76543, 76606, 76611). The ranelic acid in strontium ranelate is rapidly eliminated unchanged by the kidneys (14549). Strontium concentrations are elevated in patients with kidney dysfunction (14557, 14559, 76503, 76514).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nStrontium is a silvery metal found naturally as a non-radioactive element. It has four known stable forms and 12 known radioactive isotopes (11399). Strontium is an alkaline earth element, like calcium, and is physically and chemically similar to calcium. Ninety-nine percent of strontium in the body is found in bone (11396, 11753). Strontium chloride is the most common salt form used in dietary supplements. But there isn't much research evaluating oral use of these formulations.\nAnti-arthritis effects\nPreliminary data indicate that strontium can stimulate collagen and cartilage formation, suggesting that it may have a role in treatment of osteoarthritis (11397, 14549).\nAnticancer effects\nRadioactive strontium-89 is used for cancer. Strontium is preferentially taken up in areas of bone undergoing active bone turnover (11753, 11755). This produces much greater concentrations of strontium-89 in primary bone tumors and bone metastases than in normal bone. It therefore selectively irradiates these bone malignancies, with minimal effect on normal tissue (11755).\nBone effects\nStrontium is present in drinking water and food, and most strontium in the body comes from these dietary sources. A positive correlation appears to exist between bone mineral density in the elderly and the strontium concentration of public drinking water (106033). Strontium ranelate is the specific form of strontium used in clinical trials for osteoporosis. It consists of two atoms of stable strontium and an organic moiety called ranelic acid (11399). Its effects on bone are due to elemental strontium. The ranelic acid is rapidly eliminated unchanged by the kidneys (14549). Therapeutic doses of strontium stimulate bone formation and reduce bone resorption (11392, 11393, 11395, 11397, 11399). This is probably due to increased osteoblast precursor replication, and decreased osteoclast differentiation and resorbing activity (11395, 11399, 14549). These effects increase bone mineral density in the spine and reduce vertebral fractures in patients with osteoporosis when strontium ranelate is taken for up to 56 months (11393, 11395, 11399). The effects of longer durations of therapy are not known. The structure of the newly formed bone has not been studied, but there is some concern that the new bone may not be of high quality (11394, 11399).\n\nPreliminary data suggest very high doses of strontium can adversely affect bone. Strontium can replace calcium, especially in areas of active bone remodeling, and this influences the quality of bone mineral by reducing crystal size (11399). In bone cell cultures, high levels of strontium inhibit hydroxyapatite formation and impair mineralization (11394).\n\nStrontium can also interfere with vitamin D synthesis and calcium absorption (14557). Body control systems seem to detect high strontium levels as high calcium levels, leading to reduced synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D, so that intestinal calcium absorption is reduced (14553, 14554, 14556). These adverse effects can lead to defective mineralization and ossification of bone, manifesting as rickets during bone growth, and as osteomalacia after bone growth is complete (14556). Children are likely to be at higher risk for bone changes than adults because the developing skeleton incorporates strontium at a higher rate (14554). A positive correlation appears to exist between the incidence of rickets in children and the strontium concentration of public drinking water (106033).\n\nPeople with chronic renal failure may also be at higher risk for strontium accumulation and adverse bone changes. Elevated serum and bone strontium levels have been reported in people with end-stage renal disease, especially those on hemo- or peritoneal dialysis (14554, 14555, 14557, 14559). High levels seem to be found more commonly in patients with osteomalacia than in those with other types of renal osteodystrophy, or no bone changes (14557, 14559). Accumulation of strontium in people with chronic renal failure is probably due to reduced excretion and also the presence of strontium in dialysis solutions (14554, 14555, 14557, 14559).\nDental effects\nFor dental hypersensitivity, strontium ions in toothpaste seem to relieve pain by blocking fluid flow in dentinal tubules, which are microscopic canals in the dentin (11756). An inverse relationship appears to exist between dental caries and content of stable strontium in drinking water (11402)."

It is a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in all aerobic organisms (104122). Some forms of succinate, such as diethyl succinate, appear to permeate cells, whereas other forms, such as disodium succinate, do not (104124).\nAnti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects\nSuccinate can suppress secretion of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor, and nitric oxide, from macrophages. However, in some other cells, binding of succinate to its receptor, SUCNR1, increases production of inflammatory cytokines. These differences may be due to the type of succinate used in studies. The exogenous form, diethyl succinate, is cell-permeable, whereas naturally occurring disodium succinate is not (104124).\nAntioxidant effects\nSystemic levels of reactive oxygen species are lower in rats with sepsis when they receive parenteral succinate treatment than when they do not (104123).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal studies show that succinate increases the transepithelial electrical resistance in intestinal epithelial cells and also increases amounts of tight junction proteins in the jejunum. These changes reduce cell permeability and help maintain epithelial barrier integrity. Succinate also increases production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-25, which attenuate excessive intestinal inflammation and help to maintain integrity of epithelial cells (104122).\nHepatic enzyme effects\nPreliminary in-vitro evidence shows that succinate inhibits cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP-3A4) non-competitively, and CYP-2D6 and 2C 9 competitively (110699). It is not known whether these effects will occur in vivo.\nMusculoskeletal effects\nSuccinate plays a role in skeletal muscle remodeling, especially in conversion from fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers induced by endurance and aerobic exercise, which increase mechanical and metabolic demand on the muscle (104121). In mice, succinate improved endurance exercise performance and muscle grip strength, and decreased muscle fatigue. The mice also had an increased proportion of small muscle fibers and a decreased proportion of large muscle fibers (104121)."

However, it is unclear if these improvements are clinically meaningful. Taking sulforaphane did not improve stereotypic, social/lethargy, or speech scores when compared with placebo. Children weighing up to 45 kg took approximately 10 mg daily and children weighing at least 45 kg took approximately 20 mg daily (104537).\n\nIn contrast, a small clinical study in children 3-12 years old with moderate to severe autism symptoms shows that taking sulforaphane as a specific broccoli seed and sprout extract blend (Avmacol, Nutramax) daily for 15 weeks does not improve clinical impressions or most symptoms of autism when compared with placebo. The extract blend was dosed to provide approximately 1 mcmol sulforaphane per pound or 2.2 mcmol per kg body weight (108131). This study was small and may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. Another very small clinical study in children aged 3-7 years old with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking a specific product containing broccoli sprout powder standardized for sulforaphane (BroccoPhane, Bioriginal) with red radish sprout daily for 36 weeks does not improve measures of aberrant behavior, communication, play and imagination, restricted interests, or social responsiveness and interaction when compared with placebo (112450).\n\nSulforaphane has also been evaluated in older children or young adults. A small study in males 13-27 years of age with autism shows that taking sulforaphane daily for 18 weeks improves behavior scores by 33% and social scores by 17% when compared with placebo. After treatment discontinuation, behavior and social scores returned to baseline levels. Dosing was weight-based as follows: sulforaphane 26.6 mg daily in those weighing at least 91 kg, 17.6 mg daily in those weighing 45-91 kg, and 8.8 mg daily in those weighing up to 45 kg (95267). A small study in males and females 7-21 years of age with autism shows that taking sulforaphane as a specific broccoli seed and sprout blend (Avmacol, Nutramax Laboratories Consumer Care, Inc.) daily for 12 weeks improves social scores by 6%, but does not affect behavior scores, when compared with baseline. It is unclear if this improvement is clinically meaningful. The product used in this study contains glucoraphanin and myrosinase and was dosed to provide approximately 2.5 mcmol of glucoraphanin per pound of body weight (98501).

However, there was no significant difference in remission rate between groups (108136).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral sulforaphane is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA small clinical trial in adult males shows that taking sulforaphane 30 mg daily for 4 weeks attenuates an increase in creatine kinase levels at 24 hours following heavy resistance exercise when compared with placebo. This suggests that sulforaphane may reduce muscle damage associated with exercise (108135). However, another small preliminary clinical trial in young adult males shows that taking the sulforaphane precursor glucoraphanin (Kagome Co., Ltd.) 30 mg daily, starting 2 weeks before exercise and continuing until 4 days after, does not reduce markers of muscle damage, including aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, or creatine kinase, when compared with not taking sulforaphane (108134).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral sulforaphane is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in young adult males shows that taking the sulforaphane precursor glucoraphanin (Kagome Co., Ltd.) 30 mg daily, starting 2 weeks before exercise and continuing until 4 days after, reduces palpation-related muscle soreness and improves range of motion two days after exercise when compared with not taking sulforaphane. However, there was no difference between groups on days 1, 3, or 4 and there was no difference in pain related to extension (108134).\nless\nLiver disease. Although there is interest in using oral sulforaphane to improve liver health, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sulforaphane for this use.\nPregnancy-induced hypertension.

Each gel cap of this aqueous extract delivers 218 mg of powder containing sulforaphane 8.8 mg (95260). Each tube containing 440 mg of aqueous extract contains sulforaphane 17.6 mg (95262). Another product, Avmacol (Nutramax Laboratories Consumer Care, Inc.), contains ERS92, a proprietary broccoli seed and broccoli sprout blend. Each tablet provides 37 mcmol glucoraphanin with myrosinase to produce sulforaphane (98501, 108131).\n\nDue to the instability of sulforaphane, methods to increase its stabilization have been of interest. One popular method is to complex sulforaphane with food grade alpha-cyclodextrin (Cavamax W6, Wacker Chemical Corp.) (95252). One clinically studied brand of sulforaphane (Prostaphane) is reportedly stabilized using a patented private coating process. Each tablet of Prostaphane contains 10 mg of free stabilized sulforaphane extracted from broccoli seeds using a cold press process (95251, 95252).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with sulforaphane.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, sulforaphane undergoes systemic absorption (95252, 108130). Overall bioavailability of sulforaphane from broccoli sources or stabilized sources is approximately 70%. However, interindividual variability is high (95252, 98232) and bioavailability appears to be reduced in individuals with pregnancy-induced hypertension (108130). Peak plasma concentrations occur at approximately 1.5-2 hours after administration (95260, 108130).\nDistribution\nSulforaphane can cross the blood-brain barrier (95252).\nMetabolism\nIn the body, sulforaphane is found conjugated to cysteine, glycine, glutathione, and N-acetyl cysteine. It is first conjugated to glutathione by glutathione-S-transferase, followed by metabolism to cysteine/glycine and N-acetylcysteine conjugates (mercapturic acid) (10679, 95265, 95260, 98232, 105083). These conjugates can also be deconjugated back to sulforaphane (98232).\nExcretion\nSulforaphane and its conjugates are excreted in the urine (98232, 95269, 108133). In humans, approximately 71% of the sulforaphane dose is detectable in the urine. The half-life of sulforaphane is approximately 2-2.6 hours (95252, 95260).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSulforaphane is a sulfur-containing isothiocyanate (95251, 95252). It is produced by the reaction of glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate, with myrosinase, an enzyme. Exposure of glucoraphanin to myrosinase occurs during processing or chewing of cruciferous vegetables, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract (95251, 95252). Sulforaphane is found in the highest levels in broccoli (particularly broccoli sprouts), but is also found in cabbage, cauliflower, radish, and mustard (10264, 10463, 10681). The myrosinase naturally found in plants is denatured with cooking, which might reduce the bioavailability of sulforaphane when cooked plants are consumed. However, myrosinase is also found in the human gut microbiota (10462, 95251).\nAnti-allergic effects\nIn preliminary clinical research, taking sulforaphane seems to decrease the number of white blood cells in nasal secretions following a dust challenge in people with allergies (95265).\nAnti-cancer effects\nEpidemiologic evidence suggests that consumption of cruciferous vegetables, the main source of sulforaphane in the diet, is inversely associated with various types of cancers, including leukemia, prostate cancer, and liver cancer (10264). Preliminary evidence suggests several theories of action associated with the anti-cancer effects of sulforaphane, including the induction of carcinogen defense enzymes, inhibition of carcinogen-activating enzymes, induction of cell cycle arrest, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, and antioxidant or anti-inflammatory mechanisms (10265, 10678, 10681, 10682, 95251, 95262). A combination of sulforaphane and selenium may synergistically protect cells against oxidative damage. This synergy appears to occur at the levels of transcription and translation (10680). Sulforaphane seems to induce the enzyme thioredoxin reductase, which has antioxidant properties. Sulforaphane in combination with selenium causes greater induction of thioredoxin reductase than either compound alone (12700).\n\nSulforaphane also has effects on phase 1 and phase 2 enzymes. Sulforaphane increases the action of phase 2 enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferase, which inactivate many carcinogens. It seems to inhibit the activity of phase 1 enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and CYP1A2, that increase the carcinogenic activity of some substances (10462, 10463, 12701, 95251, 95252). Phase 2 enzyme effects might be the result of epigenetic DNA alterations, such as the inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylase enzymes involved in gene silencing (95251). Overall, sulforaphane seems to reduce proliferation, increase destruction, and prevent the spread of cancer cells (95251, 98498, 98500). In vitro, the mechanism by which sulforaphane reduces cancer cell growth and proliferation appears to depend on the length of treatment. Furthermore, cancer cells do not seem to develop resistance to sulforaphane (98499). However, in preliminary clinical research, taking a specific extract of broccoli seed (BroccoMax, Jarrow Formulas) that provided glucoraphanin as a source of sulforaphane did not modify levels of cancer biomarkers in breast tissue (95269).\n\nIn laboratory models, sulforaphane enhances the efficacy of doxorubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and other chemotherapeutic agents, potentially reducing the doses needed (98498, 98500).\nAnti-eclampsia effects\nSoluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is released from the placenta, driving systematic oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This is thought to play a role in the development of hypertension during pregnancy. Clinical research shows that sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts decreases levels of sFlt-1. However, there was no effect on levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) (108130).\nAntibiotic effects\nIn vitro, sulforaphane has selective antibiotic effects against Helicobacter pylori (95252). However, clinical research suggests that taking sulforaphane in conjunction with triple therapy does not improve H. pylori eradication (108138).\nCardioprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that sulforaphane from broccoli reduces oxidative stress in cardiovascular and kidney tissues, which might reduce hypertension and atherosclerosis (14157). In laboratory and animal research, sulforaphane protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced oxidative toxicity by inducing antioxidant enzymes and cellular processes (98498).\nCytochrome (CYP) P450 effects\nTheoretically, sulforaphane might alter the levels and effects of certain CYP substrates. Animal and in vitro research shows that sulforaphane inhibits the activity of CYP3A4 and also reduces its expression (105083, 105434, 105435). Animal and in vitro research also shows that sulforaphane inhibits CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, and CYP2B2 enzyme activity, which can lead to reduced metabolism of these enzymes. However, glucoraphanin, the precursor of sulforaphane, also appears to increase the expression of the CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, and CYP2B2 enzymes, which might conversely lead to increased metabolism of the respective substrates (105083, 105435).\nMuscle effects\nSulforaphane is of interest for the prevention of muscle damage following exercise. Due to mixed findings in research, it is unclear whether sulforaphane alters levels of muscle damage markers after exercise. However, sulforaphane seems to reduce post-exercise markers of oxidative stress and levels of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 (108134, 108135).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in using sulforaphane in the treatment of autism. In children and young adults, early research has shown that sulforaphane might result in modest improvement in social skills and behavior (95267, 98501, 104537). These improvements seem to be correlated with changes in urinary levels of compounds such as sphingolipids, as well as compounds related to oxidative and inflammatory stress, amino acid metabolism, gut microbiome metabolism, and more (98501, 108131). Sulforaphane is also of interest for depression. Sulforaphane seems to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and have beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (108136).\nRespiratory effects\nIn animal research, sulforaphane decreases airway inflammation. Sulforaphane activity on lung function is possibly related to improvement in antioxidant activity specific to a pathway involving Nrf2 gene transcription (95262, 95263). However, at least some evidence in humans suggests that sulforaphane does not affect genes related to Nrf2 (95268). In one clinical study, sulforaphane attenuated the bronchoconstriction response to a trigger in 60% of patients, although the remaining patients experienced no effect or worsening of bronchoconstriction (95268)."

Adverse effects include skin dryness, irritation, and pruritus (27846, 88112, 88120, 88121, 88126). Orally, sulfur has been reported to cause diarrhea and metabolic acidosis (27845).\nDermatologic\nTopically, application of sulfur preparations can cause dryness, leading to local irritation and pruritus in up to 28% of patients (27846, 88112, 88120, 88121, 88126).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, sulfur is converted to sulfide in the gastrointestinal tract, causing intestinal irritation which can lead to diarrhea (27845).\nless\nRenal\nThere is one case report of metabolic acidosis occurring in a 57-year-old woman who had consumed approximately 250 grams of flowers of sulfur, a form of sulfur prepared by sublimation, over a 6-day period (27845). Underlying conditions, including diabetes and renal failure, may have contributed to the acidosis. Sulfur is converted to sulfide by colonic bacteria and then to sulfate in various tissues, generating hydrogen ions which can lead to acidosis when clearance mechanisms are overwhelmed (27845).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDandruff. Sulfur is an FDA-permitted ingredient of over-the-counter (OTC) topical products to treat dandruff (88107). However, efficacy data from clinical trials is limited. In a study of 48 adults using shampoos containing sulfur 2%, salicylic acid 2%, or both ingredients twice weekly for 5 weeks, reductions in scaling and the number of desquamating cells per square centimeter were greater with any of the active treatments compared with the shampoo base alone. However, the combination of both ingredients produced significantly greater and earlier reductions than either active ingredient alone (88108).\nScabies. Applying topical preparations of 5% to 20% precipitated sulfur in petrolatum appears to be effective for the treatment of scabies in some patients. Response occurs in 24% to 97% of patients, but is unpleasant due to the smell. Sulfur preparations are applied overnight (10-12 hours) for between 3 and 6 nights, with reduced efficacy when used for only 24 hours (27846, 27847, 88124, 98205, 98207). Concentrations should be limited to between 2% and 6% for infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women (27846, 27847, 98207).\nSulfur ointments have also been compared with other treatments for scabies. Clinical research and a meta-analysis of the available research show that topical sulfur is less effective and has a higher risk of adverse effects when compared with topical permethrin or topical or oral ivermectin (98205, 100735). Sulfur ointment also seems to be more expensive when compared with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin (98207). Preliminary clinical trials and a meta-analysis have reported similar efficacy rates for topical sulfur and lindane, and for topical sulfur and benzyl benzoate (27848, 100735).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Sulfur in concentrations of 3% to 10% is an FDA-permitted ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) topical products to treat acne (88107, 88123). However, efficacy data is mainly anecdotal (88122). Creams and ointments containing 1% to 10% sulfur have been used to treat acne for many decades, but sulfur is now generally found in combination with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or sodium sulfacetamide (88120, 88121).\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). A preliminary clinical study suggests that using a homeopathic nasal spray containing sulfur, luffa, Galphimia glauca, and histamine for 42 days has similar efficacy to cromolyn sodium nasal spray for relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis (60080).\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Preliminary clinical research shows that inhalation of aerosolized sulfurous water (Acqua Breta, Terme di Riolo) 5 mL once daily for 12 days does not improve lung function when compared with baseline in patients with COPD (98206).\nCommon cold. A preliminary clinical study suggests that taking a homeopathic product containing sulfur and German ipecac (Engystol, Heel GmbH) orally for up to 2 weeks during a cold provides similar symptomatic relief to conventional over-the-counter remedies such as antihistamines, antitussives, and NSAIDs (27849).\nHyperlipidemia. A preliminary clinical study suggests that drinking 50 mL of water from a sulfurous spring three times daily for 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and decreases platelet aggregability. However, the study has methodological problems, including the lack of a control group, and does not address the effects of sulfur alone (91101).\nRosacea. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying sulfur 10% in an emollient base (Diprobase, Merck Sharp and Dohme) once daily for 4 weeks is as effective as oral tetracycline (300 mg twice daily for 1 week, then 150 mg twice daily for 3 weeks) for reducing rosacea papules and pustules (88113). Using a combination of sulfur 5% and sodium sulfacetamide 10% in a topical emollient foam (Clarifoam EF, Onset Dermatologics) twice daily also seems to reduce the severity of rosacea (88111, 88112). Other clinical research shows that using this same product for 8 weeks reduces inflammatory lesions by an additional 42% and erythema by an additional 52% when compared with placebo (88112). In another study, using foam containing sulfur 5% and sodium sulfacetamide 10% for 8 weeks reduced papules, pustules, and overall severity of rosacea more than topical metronidazole 0.75% gel (88112).\nMore evidence is needed to rate sulfur for these uses.",

Sulfur's keratolytic action is used therapeutically to treat acne and seborrheic dermatitis (88120).\nExercise effects\nSome preliminary clinical evidence suggests that drinking sulfur mineral water reduces levels of thiols and creatine phosphokinase in the blood after exercise. However, this has not been shown to prevent muscle damage in humans (98208).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSulfate-reducing bacteria are thought to contribute to gastrointestinal inflammation and diseases like Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of summer savory are the leaves and stem. Summer savory contains tannins (18), phenolic compounds and flavonoids, and a volatile oil (0.2-5.0%), the major components of which are carvacrol 47%, para-cymene 20%, gamma-terpinene 17%, alpha-pinene 1.8%, thymol 1.7%, caryophyllene 1.6%, and myrcene 1.3%. It also contains lesser amounts of alpha-terpinene, delta-cardinene, aromadendrene, eucalyptol, alpha-thujene, beta-pinene, alpha-thujone, anethole, camphor, octanoic acid, limonene, and camphene (5, 6, 11, 18, 98506, 98507, 104538, 112310, 112311, 112312). Seasonal variation and climate affect the levels of these compounds in the volatile oil (98507). Other constituents also present include vitamin A, calcium, potassium, and proteins (11).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nA mild antidiarrheal effect is reportedly due to the astringent activity of the tannins found in summer savory (5, 6, 18).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSummer savory oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties, as well as antiparasitic effects (6, 11, 98506, 98507, 104538). The antimicrobial effects appear to be related to the monoterpene constituents of the volatile oil, such as carvacrol, cymene, and thymol (98507, 104538). Antifungal activity has been demonstrated in vitro against Penicillium crustosum and P. chrysogenum, with lesser activity against P. brevicompactum and Candida albicans. Aspergillus niger is resistant (112311). Summer savory oil also has bactericidal activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis isolated from poultry, and inhibits biofilm formation by these bacteria (112310).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, an ethanol extract of summer savory demonstrates antioxidant activity. The volatile oils exhibit less in vitro antioxidant activity than the ethanol extract (104538). The oils provide antioxidant protection for cumene at 1mg/L, and for more highly oxidizable squalene at 100 mg/L (112312). Antioxidant activity is due primarily to phenolic compounds, including carvacrol and thymol (112312).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn mice with gut microbiota modified to that of humans, summer savory essential oil increases plasma levels of thrombomodulin, a natural anticoagulant that may be beneficial in people with ischemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. However, it also increases plasma levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, including CXCL1, CCL2, CCL11, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-23, and decreases levels of anti-inflammatory IL-4 (112309).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn mice with gut microbiota modified to that of humans, summer savory essential oil has prebiotic effects, increasing activity of beneficial commensal bacteria, including Lactobacilli (112309).\nSpasmolytic effects\nSummer savory is traditionally used for intestinal disorders including cramps and indigestion. Laboratory research suggests that summer savory oil has spasmolytic properties (6, 11)."

Sundew contains various constituents, including naphthoquinones, flavanols (76658), stigmasterol, plumbagin, droserone, and beta-sitosterol (76650). Deoxyribonuclease enzymes (76672), proteases (76666), and naphthoquinone derivatives have also been isolated from sundew (76651, 76669). It also contains flavonoids (76667), including hyperoside, quercetin, and isoquercitrin (76649, 76650, 76655).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal and in vitro research, ethanol and aqueous extracts of sundew have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, possibly due to its flavonoid constituents (76649, 76655, 76659).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, sundew extracts have exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans (76656, 76663, 76664, 76671).\nAntispasmodic effects\nIn vitro, sundew extracts have exhibited antispasmodic effects, potentially affecting allosteric binding of muscarinic M3 receptors (76649, 76655). Some of the antispasmodic effects of sundew may be due to the constituent quercetin (76651).\nPulmonary effects\nThere is interest in using sundew for respiratory illnesses. Clinical research in adult smokers with low forced expiratory volume (FEV1) shows that taking a combination plant-based formulation containing sundew might improve FEV1 and oxygen saturation, as well as disability and sleep disturbances, when compared with placebo (76657)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows a qualified health claim stating that using high-oleic acid sunflower oil as a replacement for other dietary fats and oils higher in saturated fat may reduce the risk of CHD.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that replacing 7.5% of energy from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils with high-oleic acid sunflower oil can reduce CHD risk by about 9% to 19%. Furthermore, analysis of results from observational studies found that replacing partially hydrogenated oil with high-oleic acid sunflower oil is associated with a 16% to 35% reduction in the risk of CHD events (95745). The FDA allows for a qualified health claim that replacing dietary fats and oils higher in saturated fat with high-oleic acid sunflower oil may reduce the risk of CHD. To achieve this benefit, the use of high-oleic acid sunflower oil should not increase total daily energy intake. The suggested daily dietary intake is about 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of high-oleic sunflower oil in place of other fats and oils (98563). Sunflower oil that contains high amounts of linoleic acid rather than oleic acid does not appear to improve cholesterol levels or reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CHD (96205).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Consuming sunflower oil in the diet may reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in some patients.\nThere is evidence that using sunflower oil in the diet as 45-50 grams daily for up to 12 weeks is more effective than olive oil for decreasing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels in healthy individuals (9780). Also, clinical research in patients with mild hyperlipidemia or moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that consuming specific brands of mid-oleic acid (NuSun) or high-oleic acid (Sunola, Meadow Lea Foods) sunflower oils as 15% to 20% of dietary calories for up to 5 weeks is more effective than olive oil or saturated fat for decreasing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels (76697, 76698). Also, consuming a high-oleic sunflower oil-rich diet for 3 weeks decreases total cholesterol levels to a greater extent than diets enriched with palm oil or medium-chain triglycerides in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia (67569). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that consuming a diet rich in sunflower oil for 3 weeks decreases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with baseline. However, levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol appear to be lowered as well (76714).\n\nDespite these beneficial effects, sunflower oil might be less effective than some other dietary oils. Taking sunflower oil for 3 months appears to be less effective than rice bran oil for lowering cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia (76699). Also, while consuming sunflower oil 45 grams daily, as part of the diet and as a supplement, for 12 weeks reduces levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline, it appears to be less effective at reducing total cholesterol levels than flaxseed oil in certain patients at risk for atherosclerosis (76696). In addition, taking sunflower oil 15.1 grams daily for 4 months does not appear to reduce levels of total or LDL cholesterol in patients with peripheral vascular disease (76691).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Oral sunflower oil does not seem to lower blood pressure.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that taking sunflower oil 30-40 grams daily for one year is less effective than extra-virgin olive oil for reducing blood pressure (5091). Also, clinical research in elderly adults with hypertension shows that taking 60 grams of sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks is less effective than virgin olive oil for reducing systolic blood pressure (76692).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral sunflower oil is beneficial for atherosclerosis; some clinical research suggests that it may provide less benefit than other dietary oils.\nSome preliminary clinical research in individuals with overweight and obesity shows that taking sunflower oil 30 mL (about 27 grams) daily for 90 days decreases carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) by 3.5% when compared to baseline, but not when compared with olive oil or flaxseed oil. Sunflower oil also improves flow-mediated vasodilation by 73% when compared to baseline, compared with no improvement in those taking flaxseed oil or olive oil (99303). Other preliminary clinical research in individuals waiting for carotid endarterectomy shows that taking sunflower oil 6 grams daily for up to 189 days is less effective than the same dose of fish oil, and equivalent to control oil, for improving the status of atherosclerotic plaques (76688).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical sunflower oil for atopic dermatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sunflower oil for this condition.\nChild growth. It is unclear if topical sunflower oil is beneficial for early child growth.\nA large preliminary clinical trial in newborn infants in India shows that exclusive topical application of 10 mL of high-linoleic acid sunflower oil, an average of 2.7 times daily for about one month, increases weight gain by 1.3 gram/kg daily when compared with a control group exclusively given traditional vigorous massage with mustard oil an average of 2.4 times daily. The increase in weight gain was highest for infants weighing less than 1500-2000 grams at birth (108141). However, it is unclear if any beneficial effects are due to the sunflower oil, the massage, their combination, or the lack of mustard oil.\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with sunflower oil is beneficial for dry mouth.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with moderate dry mouth associated with medication use shows that using a sunflower oil mouth rinse and gargling for 5-8 minutes before spitting it out twice daily for 7 days improves dry mouth scores by 23% when compared to baseline. Sunflower oil also improves the ability to swallow and sleep with dry mouth, but not other dry mouth symptoms or saliva flow rate, when compared with control (105523). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if topical sunflower oil is beneficial for dry skin in infants.\nPreliminary clinical research in full-term, newborn infants shows that topical application of 4 drops of sunflower oil to each of three parts of the body twice daily for 4 weeks improves skin hydration, but not skin barrier function or the presence of redness or rash, when compared with not using topical oil. Furthermore, use of sunflower oil may impede the normal development of skin barrier function that occurs during the first four weeks of life (96144).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if topical sunflower oil is beneficial for preventing early mortality in premature infants.\nA large clinical trial in newborn infants in India shows that exclusive topical application of 10 mL of high-linoleic acid sunflower oil, an average of 2.7 times daily for about one month, reduces infant mortality by 58% when compared to a control group exclusively given traditional vigorous massage with mustard oil an average of 2.4 times daily. A subgroup analysis of premature infants also shows a 52% reduction in mortality with the use of high-linoleic acid sunflower oil when compared with control (108143). However, it is unclear if any beneficial effects are due to the sunflower oil, the massage, their combination, or the lack of mustard oil. In contrast, another large clinical study conducted in Nepal shows that using sunflower oil for neonatal massage does not reduce neonatal mortality overall, or when analyzed by subgroups according to gestational age or birth weight, when compared with mustard oil massage, (116247). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by baseline differences in neonatal mortality rates between populations, methodological differences, or differences in adherence to study regimens.\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if topical sunflower oil improves gingival health.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that massaging coconut oil 15 mL on the gingiva for 10-15 minutes twice daily after brushing for 21 days improves inflammation and bleeding when compared to baseline. Additionally, the results with sunflower oil are similar when compared with coconut or sesame oil (115884).\nless\nPrematurity. Small to moderate-sized clinical studies suggest that topical sunflower oil might increase body weight, reduce length of hospital stay, and improve skin hydration and skin integrity in preterm neonates.\nPreliminary clinical research in preterm infants with low birth weight shows that massaging for 5-10 minutes using sunflower oil 10 mL/kg three times daily for 2 weeks increases weight gain by approximately 35% over 2 months when compared with massage using no oil. Sunflower oil massage does not appear to increase length or head circumference (96145). A small clinical study in premature infants in the intensive care unit (ICU) shows that a similar massage with sunflower oil three times daily for 5 days shortens ICU stay by about 5 days when compared with no massage. Furthermore, over the ICU stay, infants in the sunflower oil massage group gained an average of 15 grams, whereas infants in the control group experienced weight loss (98479).\n\nThe effect of sunflower oil on skin hydration and integrity in preterm infants has also been assessed. A clinical trial of 90 preterm infants in a Turkish neonatal ICU shows that whole body skin treatment (not massage) with either sunflower oil or almond oil 4 mL/kg four times daily for 5 days improves measures of skin hydration and skin integrity when compared with control infants that did not receive oil treatment. The sunflower and almond oil treatments are equally effective (105524). Another clinical study in 90 infants (42% preterm) in a Turkish neonatal ICU shows that whole body skin treatment (not massage) with sunflower oil or liquid Vaseline 3-4 mL for preterm and 5-6 mL for full-term infants daily for 16 days improves measures of skin integrity when compared with control infants that did not receive any oil treatment. Skin integrity scores were better in the sunflower oil group than liquid Vaseline at some time points (111726).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using topical sunflower oil for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sunflower oil for this condition.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there is interest in using oral sunflower oil for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sunflower oil for this condition.\nTinea pedis. It is unclear if topical sunflower oil is beneficial for tinea pedis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of a specific brand of ozonized sunflower oil (Oleozon) twice daily for 6 weeks is as effective as ketoconazole for curing athlete's foot (76687).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate sunflower oil for these uses.",

Sunflower oil is high in linoleic acid and is used as a source of polyunsaturated fat in the diet (8132, 96144, 96145, 99303). Sunflower oil also contains oleic acid at levels of approximately 21% to 32% (96144, 96145, 99303). Some sunflower oil is bred to contain higher levels of oleic acid (76697, 76698).\nApoptotic effects\nPreliminary research in an animal model of diabetes, suggests that high amount of dietary sunflower oil might increase the rate of heart cell death (14044).\nHypolipidemic effects\nWhen used in the diet, sunflower oil decreases levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as apo B, when compared with some, but not all, fats. This is likely due to the low levels of saturated fatty acids in sunflower oil, as well as the presence of the polyunsaturated linoleic acid and the monounsaturated oleic acid (9780, 67569, 76696, 76697, 76698, 76699, 76714, 99303).\nSkin effects\nPreterm infants and infants with malnutrition are at a greater risk of infection. There is interest in using topical sunflower oil in these infants to improve the skin barrier function. This might reduce the risk of infection. Clinical research shows that sunflower oil can alter the skin microbiota, improve skin integrity, and reduce transepidermal water loss in infants (105524, 108139, 111726)."

It is unclear if oral superoxide dismutase is beneficial in these patients.\nTwo clinical studies in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee show that intra-articular administration of superoxide dismutase 16 mg every 1-2 weeks for 3-6 weeks reduces pain for up to 3-6 months after initiation of treatment when compared with placebo or methylprednisolone (2228, 2229).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Intra-articular injection of superoxide dismutase may reduce knee stiffness, flexion, and pain in patients with RA affecting the knees. It is unclear if oral superoxide dismutase is beneficial in these patients.\nThree small clinical studies in patients with RA show that intra-articular administration of superoxide dismutase 4 mg weekly for up to 6 weeks improves knee stiffness, flexion, and pain for up to 12-24 weeks after initiation of treatment when compared with methylprednisolone or aspirin (2230, 2231, 2232).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Intravenous superoxide dismutase may not confer additional benefits in patients with acute MI undergoing thrombolysis or coronary angioplasty.\nClinical studies in patients undergoing thrombolysis or coronary angioplasty for acute MI show that intravenous administration of superoxide dismutase does not improve reperfusion or left ventricular function when compared with placebo (2241, 2243).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear if subcutaneous superoxide dismutase can prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates with ARDS.\nA small clinical study in neonates with ARDS shows that subcutaneous administration of superoxide dismutase 0.25 mg/kg twice daily until ventilator support is no longer required reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by around 70% when compared with placebo. For every two neonates treated with subcutaneous superoxide dismutase, one additional case of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is prevented. Also, superoxide dismutase can reduce the incidence of wheezing and pneumonia in these infants (2242).\nless\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral superoxide dismutase to prevent the signs and symptoms of aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of superoxide dismutase for this purpose.\nAging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral superoxide dismutase to prevent and treat aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of superoxide dismutase for this purpose.\nBurns. Although there has been interest in using topical superoxide dismutase for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of superoxide dismutase for this purpose.\nCorneal ulceration. It is unclear if ophthalmic superoxide dismutase is beneficial in patients with noninfectious corneal ulceration.\nA case series of 19 patients with noninfectious corneal ulcers found that application of a specific lecithinated superoxide dismutase 0.1% ophthalmic solution for at least 2 weeks reduces ulcer size and improves healing in most patients (14815). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral superoxide dismutase has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking a specific combination product (ALA600SOD, Alfa Wassermann) providing superoxide dismutase 140 IU and alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 4 months improves pain by 18% when compared to baseline. Small improvements in motor and sensory nerve conduction were also reported (20488). Another small clinical study in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking a specific combination product (Combinerv, Libytec Pharmaceuticals) providing superoxide dismutase 10 mg, alpha-lipoic acid 570 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 300 mg, and vitamin B12 250 mcg daily for 12 months improves pain scores by 16% when compared with placebo. Taking this combination product also improved diabetic quality of life scores and some measures of nerve conduction when compared with placebo (105502). It is unclear if these effects are due to superoxide dismutase, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nInterstitial cystitis. It is unclear if injecting superoxide dismutase into the bladder wall is beneficial in patients with interstitial cystitis.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with radiation-induced or interstitial cystitis shows that administration of superoxide dismutase 4-12 mg as an injection into the bladder wall every 4-6 weeks for up to 6 treatments improves pain, urinary urgency, incontinence, bladder capacity, and micturition frequency when compared to baseline (2233). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nMale infertility. Oral superoxide dismutase has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear for male infertility.\nA moderate-size cross-sectional, propensity-score matched study in males with idiopathic infertility suggests that taking a combination product containing superoxide dismutase, hydroxytyrosol, and carnosol (FertiPlus SOD, Idipharma) for 3 months modestly improves progressive sperm motility, sperm morphology, and sperm DNA fragmentation index but does not affect semen volume or sperm concentration when compared with control (112091). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to superoxide dismutase, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNeck pain. Oral superoxide dismutase has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic neck pain shows that taking a specific combination product (ALA600SOD, Alfa Wassermann) containing superoxide dismutase 140 IU and alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 2 months, along with physiotherapy, reduces neck pain when compared with physiotherapy alone. In addition to improvements in pain scores at rest and during movement, 81% of patients receiving the combination product reported their pain to be \"much improved\" or \"slightly improved\", compared with just 29% of patients receiving physiotherapy alone. For every two patients treated with this supplement plus physiotherapy, one additional patient will report pain improvement over physiotherapy alone (90440).\nless\nObesity. Oral superoxide dismutase has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in obese patients shows that taking superoxide dismutase 400 IU with Saccharomyces bouldardii 5 billion colony forming units twice daily for 60 days does not reduce body weight, body mass index, or measures of hunger and satiety when compared with placebo (106848).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if intravenous superoxide dismutase is beneficial in patients with pneumonia.\nA small clinical study in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia shows that intravenous infusion of lecithinized superoxide dismutase 40 or 80 mg daily for 28 days does not improve lung function when compared with placebo (95212).\nless\nRadiation fibrosis. It is unclear if topical superoxide dismutase is beneficial in patients with radiation fibrosis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with post-radiation fibrosis following treatment for head and neck cancer shows that applying ¼ teaspoon of topical superoxide dismutase (Sodermix cream, Life Science Investments) twice daily for 3 months does not improve symptoms of fibrosis when compared with placebo (101080).\nless\nRadiation-induced cystitis. It is unclear if injecting superoxide dismutase into the bladder wall is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced cystitis.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with radiation-induced or interstitial cystitis shows that administration of superoxide dismutase 4-12 mg as an injection into the bladder wall every 4-6 weeks for up to 6 treatments improves pain, urinary urgency, incontinence, bladder capacity, and micturition frequency when compared to baseline (2233). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral superoxide dismutase is beneficial in patients with stress.\nA small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that taking a specific melon extract (Extramel, Bionov), providing superoxide dismutase 140 IU, daily for 12 weeks slightly reduces stress when compared with placebo. Stress scores were reduced by 6.6%, compared with a 2.6% reduction with placebo (95211). It is unclear if this difference would be considered clinically significant.\nless\nVitiligo. It is unclear if oral superoxide dismutase is beneficial in patients with vitiligo.\nA small clinical study in patients with non-segmental vitiligo shows that taking a gliadin-protected formulation of superoxide dismutase (Glisodin, Isocell Laboratory) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks followed by 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks along with twice-weekly phototherapy improves the degree of re-pigmentation when compared with placebo plus phototherapy (106849).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate superoxide dismutase for these uses.",

It is also available in an ophthalmic form (14815) or topical cream (Sodermix, Life Science Investments) (101080). Orally, superoxide dismutase is found in a product also containing alpha-lipoic acid (90450, 20488) or as part of a melon product (95211). A proprietary coated freeze-dried melon juice concentrate (Extramel) is used as a source of superoxide dismutase. This product contains 14 units of superoxide dismutase per mg powder and each capsule contains 10 mg powder (95211). A gliadin-protected formulation of superoxide dismutase (Glisodin, Isocell Laboratory) is purported to resist deactivation in the gastrointestinal tract (106849).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSuperoxide dismutase is an essential enzyme found in all living cells. Some cellular processes produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals that can impair cell function. Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, reducing damage from ROS (11157, 20488, 95212).\n\nSuperoxide dismutase isoenzymes contain copper and zinc. Some contain iron or manganese. Copper and zinc superoxide dismutase is the most common (11157).\n\nSuperoxide dismutase is found in yeast, spinach, chicken liver, and bovine blood (11157). Commercially, it is typically obtained from bovine liver (11008). Sometimes it is obtained from melon extracts (95211).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that the analgesic effects of superoxide dismutase are related to inhibition of inflammatory response (20488)."

Fasting insulin and glucose levels decreased by 4% and 1%, respectively, when compared with the diet without sweet almonds. Also, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were reduced by about 12% (99941). Preliminary clinical research also shows that regularly consuming sweet almonds as part of a low-carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks is more effective than consuming cheese, but no more effective than peanuts, for reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (99943, 101787). However, the change in HbA1c demonstrated in these small trials may not be considered clinically relevant.\n\nIn contrast, meta-analyses of many clinical trials in patients with a variety of metabolic disorders, including diabetes, shows that eating almonds 5-85 grams daily, or as 10% to 20% of energy, for 4-24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c, insulin levels, or measures of insulin resistance when compared with control (109019, 111395).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral sweet almond might reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia, but it does not appear to improve other lipid levels in these patients.\nSeveral small clinical studies in adults with hyperlipidemia show that consuming raw sweet almonds 42.5-100 grams or taking sweet almond oil 10 mL daily for 4-9 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 3% to 15% when compared with control diets or baseline levels. Most of these studies failed to show improvements in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels or triglyceride levels when compared with control (76725, 76737, 99939, 101786), although one study showed a 4% improvement in HDL levels (99940).\n\nA meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials in patients with hyperlipidemia or in which at least half of the patients were classified as having hyperlipidemia shows that consuming sweet almonds or taking sweet almond oil daily for 4-12 weeks modestly reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol but does not improve very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or HDL cholesterol when compared with placebo or no treatment (111395).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral sweet almond is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 10 small clinical studies in which at least half of the patients in each study were classified as having hypertension at baseline shows that taking sweet almond does not improve systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo or no treatment (111395). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral sweet almond is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that consuming 20 grams of sweet almonds 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily for 3 months reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 6 mg/dL and 0.4%, respectively, and improves measures of insulin resistance when compared with a control group. For every 4 patients consuming sweet almonds, one additional patient experienced normalization of HbA1c. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were also improved with sweet almond over control (111389). In contrast, a small clinical crossover study in adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity shows that consuming 50 grams of sweet almonds daily for 5 months increases postprandial glucose and decreases insulin sensitivity when compared with control. The study also found increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and energy intake with almond consumption (116046). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in dietary guidance, treatment durations, and patient populations studied.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral sweet almond is beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nPreliminary clinical research in students shows that consuming ten sweet almonds daily for 2 weeks reduces the percentage of students reporting insomnia on sleep surveys from 78% to 69% (101784). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral sweet almond flour is beneficial in patients with IBS.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking sweet almond flour 40 grams orally daily for 20 days does not improve IBS symptom scores when compared with a wheat flour placebo. In fact, those taking sweet almond flour experienced an increase in severity of pain and the number of bowel movements (101785).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral sweet almond is beneficial for people with overweight and obesity, due to mixed evidence.\nA meta-analysis of 37, mostly small, clinical studies shows that consuming sweet almond slightly reduces body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass, but not body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass, waist-to-hip ratio, or subjective appetite scores, when compared with control (116045). The observed improvements are unlikely to be clinically significant. However, the validity of these findings is limited by high heterogeneity in dietary control options used across studies.\n\nA clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that consuming almonds 30-50 grams daily as part of an energy-restricted diet for 3 months, followed by 6 months of weight maintenance, does not reduce weight, improve body composition, or ameliorate cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with a nut-free energy-restricted diet (116044). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in adults with overweight and obesity shows that consuming 30-50 grams of sweet almonds does not reduce self-reported appetite ratings or subsequent short-term energy intake despite favorable changes in appetite-regulating hormones when compared with a carbohydrate-rich snack as a control (111388).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there has been interest in using topical sweet almond oil for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sweet almond for this purpose.\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical sweet almond ointment is beneficial in patients with radiation dermatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in females receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer shows that topical use of a sweet almond ointment once before each treatment and once a few hours after each treatment does not prevent radiation dermatitis when compared with chamomile extract cream (76740).\nless\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical sweet almond oil is beneficial in patients with stretch marks.\nPreliminary clinical research in nulliparous patients shows that topical application of sweet almond oil twice daily, starting at gestational week 16 and continued until delivery, does not reduce the size or number of stretch marks when compared with control. However, using the sweet almond oil modestly reduced itching scores (97322).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate sweet almond for these uses.",

Sweet almond is considered an acceptable food for patients following the low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) diet, a diet designed for patients with IBS. However, in one small trial, consuming sweet almond flour 40 grams daily, a dose higher than suggested with this diet, worsened IBS symptoms such as pain and diarrhea (101785).\nless\nNEPHROLITHIASIS (KIDNEY STONES)\nConsuming sweet almond milk may increase the risk of developing kidney stones in patients with a higher risk of nephrolithiasis. Sweet almond milk has been associated with at least three cases of genitourinary problems, including dysuria, hematuria, and hyperoxaluria, in children with a predisposition to calcium-based nephrolithiasis. Symptoms included dysuria, hematuria, and hyperoxaluria. The children were drinking up to 32 ounces of almond milk daily, along with an overall low fluid intake (99942). Because sweet almonds are high in oxalate, excessive quantities of almond milk in the absence of other adequate fluids should be avoided, especially in those with a predisposition to calcium-based nephrolithiasis.\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of sweet almond.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sweet almond are the kernel and hull, and fixed oil from the almond kernel. Sweet almond oil contains triglycerides, largely triolein and dioleolinolein, and fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, palmitic, stearic, lauric, myristic and palmitoleic acids (11). Sweet almond kernels also contain sphingolipids, daucosterol, and beta sitosterol (14910, 76737). The skins of the kernels contain flavonoid and phenolic antioxidant compounds including quercetin, naringenin, catechin, and vanillic acid (14911).\n\nSweet almond hulls contain ursolic acid, catechins; and the terpenes betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid which are being studied for anticancer, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties (14912). Raw sweet almonds contain an average of 41 mg oxalate per 100 grams (99942).\nAnti-aging effects\nThere is interest in using sweet almonds to reduce the effects of aging, such as telomere lengthening. However, a small clinical study in overweight and obese adults shows that consuming a sweet almond-enriched diet for 12 weeks does not prevent telomere lengthening when compared with a nut-free diet (109020).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPooled data from clinical studies show that consuming sweet almonds can reduce interleukin-6 but has no effect on C-reactive protein. Researchers propose that this may be due to high levels of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phenolic acids, phytosterols, fiber, and flavonoids. Flavonoids exert anti-inflammatory effects through the regulation of inflammatory genes in endothelial cells and macrophages. Almonds are also high in fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid, which reduces inflammatory mediators. Lastly, intestinal fermentation of fiber in almonds produces short-chain fatty acids that protect against inflammation (111393).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSweet almonds have demonstrated hypoglycemic effects in some animal and human studies (76736, 99941, 101787). A clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that sweet almond reduces postprandial glycemia (99943). Conversely, a clinical study in adults at above-average risk of cardiovascular disease shows that daily sweet almond consumption has no effect on blood glucose levels, insulin levels, or homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score (105802).\nAntioxidant effects\nPooled data from clinical studies show that consuming sweet almonds reduces malondialdehyde levels but not oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels. Researchers theorize that the increase in malondialdehyde bolsters the antioxidant defense system and ameliorates oxidative stress, thereby preventing cellular damage (111390).\nCardiometabolic effects\nThere is interest in sweet almonds for improving cardiometabolic health. Almonds are associated with an increase in phosphatidylcholines and their derivative, lysophosphatidylcholines, which are quantitatively related to cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammation, and metabolic conditions. Almond consumption also lowers the palmitoleic acid:palmitic acid ratio, which is a diagnostic marker for early onset steatohepatitis and is associated with impaired glucose tolerance. Lastly, almond consumption may stimulate the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a central metabolic pathway where nutrients are converted into energy. The effect of almonds on host TCA cycles and lipid metabolism are associated with changes in gut microbial metabolism - alterations that may interact to potentiate cardiometabolic benefits (111394).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe cardiovascular effects of sweet almond are unclear; clinical research in varying patient populations has yielded conflicting results. A clinical study in adults at above-average risk of cardiovascular disease shows that daily sweet almond consumption improves vascular endothelial function, as assessed by increases in flow-mediated dilation in the brachial artery, but has no effect on blood pressure when compared with control (105802). Another clinical study in older adults with a body mass index classified as overweight to obese shows that consuming a sweet almond-enriched diet significantly reduces systolic blood pressure, but has no effect on diastolic blood pressure, endothelial cell adhesion molecule concentrations, or arterial compliance, when compared with consuming a nut-free diet (105803). A meta-analysis of 16 clinical studies shows that sweet almond consumption significantly decreases diastolic blood pressure but has no effect on systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo or control (105804).\nCognitive effects\nA clinical study in older adults with a body mass index classified as overweight to obese shows that consuming a sweet almond-enriched diet has no effect on cognitive performance with respect to attention, memory, mood, or executive function when compared with consuming a nut-free diet (105803). However, other clinical research in overweight and obese adults suggests that sweet almond may ameliorate the post-lunch decline in memory (99936).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA clinical study in adults at above-average risk of cardiovascular disease shows that daily sweet almond consumption has no effect on fecal short chain fatty acid composition or total short chain fatty acid levels when compared with control (105802).\nHepatic effects\nA clinical study in adults at above-average risk of cardiovascular disease shows that daily sweet almond consumption has no effect on liver fat or markers of fatty liver when compared with control (105802).\nHypolipidemic effects\nThe effects of sweet almond on the lipid profile are unclear. In human research, sweet almonds or sweet almond oil have been reported to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels (76722, 76725, 76735, 76737, 99939, 101786, 101789, 101790, 105802). A clinical study in adults at above-average risk of cardiovascular disease shows that daily sweet almond consumption reduces LDL and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol levels, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HLD) cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with control (105802). Conversely, a clinical study in older adults with a body mass index classified as overweight to obese shows that consuming a sweet almond-enriched diet significantly reduces triglyceride levels but has no effect on other lipid parameters (105803). It has been proposed that the most likely mechanism of LDL lowering is the enhancement of LDL receptor activity when monounsaturated fatty acids replace saturated ones in the diet. Saturated fatty acids may suppress LDL receptors (76731, 99940). In human research, sweet almond consumption increases monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, in the body (99940, 105802). This change improves cholesterol levels and other lipid coronary heart disease risk factors (99940).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in adding sweet almonds to the diet to reduce body weight and increase fat loss, although conflicting evidence exists (99937, 101789, 105801, 105802). Possible mechanisms of action include improved dietary compliance, reduced appetite, and improved satiety. However, some clinical research has shown that sweet almond has no effect on appetite, hunger, or fullness, and may have mixed effects on body composition (99937, 105801, 105802, 111388). One clinical study in patients with overweight and obesity found that consuming almonds alters appetite-regulating hormone values when compared with an isocaloric carbohydrate snack. C-peptide was reduced by 47% and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide were increased by 18%, 39%, and 45%, respectively. However, changes to appetite-regulating hormones were not potent enough to impact self-reported appetite or subsequent food intake. Researchers theorize that the satiating properties of almonds are due to their high levels of protein, fiber, and unsaturated fatty acids (111388)."

            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Sweet Annie 300 mg daily has been used with apparent safety in studies lasting up to 9 months (11055, 94520, 94521). Sweet Annie tea, prepared from dried leaves and twigs and consumed in divided doses daily, has been used with apparent safety for up to 7 days (11055, 11058).

In one case, a 52-year-old patient developed hepatitis after taking the Sweet Annie constituent artemisinin 200 mg three times daily for 10 days. The patient developed abdominal pain and dark urine and was found to have elevated liver enzymes consistent with hepatitis. Symptoms resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuing use. Although it is possible this supplement caused liver disease in this patient, it is not certain. In clinical trials evaluating artemisinin, elevated liver enzymes have only been reported in around 0.9% of patients. However, the dose of artemisinin in this case was substantially higher than a typical dose (16895). A case of severe acute cholestatic hepatitis has also been reported in a 51-year-old male who drank Sweet Annie tea daily, prepared using 1.25 grams of Sweet Annie powder, for malaria prophylaxis during a 4-week trip to Ethiopia. Three weeks after his return, he presented with malaise, abdominal discomfort, jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and markers of cholestasis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and ursodeoxycholic acid and ultimately recovered (103255).\n\nA series of cases linking the use of a supercritical carbon dioxide extract of Sweet Annie to hepatoxicity has also been reported. Of the 29 reports of adverse hepatic reactions to this extract, 19 patients noted symptoms within 12 weeks of starting the extract, 16 patients experienced jaundice, and 9 patients required hospitalization. Other common symptoms of hepatotoxicity included abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, fever, headache, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, and lethargy. All but one case involved doses below or up to the extract's recommended dose of 300 mg daily. Upon discontinuation, symptoms resolved completely or were improved in nearly all cases (103254).\nless\nImmunologic\nOne case of a mild allergic reaction to Sweet Annie tea has been reported. The reaction was characterized by a rash and cough that resolved quickly and did not require treatment (11059).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Sweet Annie sublingual immunotherapy drops seem to be beneficial for preventing or reducing seasonal allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivits symptoms related to Sweet Annie (Artemisia annua) pollen.\nA large clinical study in adults with Artemisia annua (Sweet Annie) pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis shows that taking sublingual drops of a glycerinated allergen extract of Sweet Annie for 32 weeks, beginning 4 months prior to pollen season, improves combined symptom and rescue medication use scores by 22% when compared with placebo. However, in this study the beneficial effects of Sweet Annie appear to be limited to patients mono-sensitized to its pollen; there was no significant improvement in patients who were also sensitized to other pollens (106441). A smaller clinical study shows that taking these drops beginning as early as 8-9 weeks pre-pollen season modestly improves both symptom and rescue medication scores when compared to a control group receiving only symptomatic drugs. In this study, the beneficial effects occurred in patients mono-sensitized to Artemisia pollen, as well as those patients who were also sensitized to other pollens (109315). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and placebo-control.\n\nA small open-label clinical study in adults with confirmed sensitization to Artemisia annua (Sweet Annie) pollen and a history of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis shows that taking standardized Sweet Annie sublingual immunotherapy drops combined with pharmacotherapy for a year before allergy season improves rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and rescue medication use during allergy season when compared with pharmacotherapy alone (112392). Two additional open-label studies also show that Sweet Annie sublingual immunotherapy, given for up to 16 months, improves rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and rescue medication use for up to 2 allergy seasons when compared with control in individuals who are mono-sensitized to Sweet Annie and in those who are poly-sensitized to Sweet Annie plus a variety of other pollen allergens (112393, 112394). All of the aforementioned studies were conducted in China where Sweet Annie is the primary outdoor pollen responsible for seasonal allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis (106441, 109315, 112392, 112393, 112394). As a result, the applicability of the findings to other geographical regions may be limited.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nMalaria. It is unclear if Sweet Annie is beneficial for malaria.\nSome research shows that consuming Sweet Annie tea orally for 4-7 days might improve symptoms and decrease parasite load in patients with malaria (11055, 11058). The Sweet Annie constituent artemisinin is of interest for its antimalarial activity, possibly by inactivating the parasite (3185, 11056, 11057, 11059). Derivatives of the artemisinin constituent are occasionally used as medication in combination with other antimalarial compounds (103258). However, there is some concern that using Sweet Annie tea itself as monotherapy may lead to poor long-term outcomes, as well as resistance to artemisinin derivatives (11055, 11059).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if Sweet Annie is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA clinical study in adults with borderline and mild NAFLD shows that taking an aqueous extract of Sweet Annie 686 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations from baseline by a mean of 16 units/L, compared with a reduction of 7 units/L in the placebo group. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations and fatigue scores were also improved in those receiving Sweet Annie (106442). However, there have also been reports of liver toxicity with Sweet Annie (16895, 103254, 103255).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if Sweet Annie is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific Sweet Annie extract (Arthrem, Promissia Limited) 150 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces pain and stiffness and improves function when compared to baseline in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. However, taking this same extract at a dose of 300 mg twice daily did not produce the same effects (94521). In an extension of this study, the therapeutic effects of taking Sweet Annie 150 mg twice daily were maintained for 6 additional months (94520). However, the validity of these results is limited due to a lack of statistical comparison between the Sweet Annie and placebo groups.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if Sweet Annie is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with RA shows that taking Sweet Annie 30 grams in warm water once daily for 48 weeks in combination with leflunomide and methotrexate modestly reduces pain, swelling, and tenderness in the joints and increases the cessation of corticosteroids when compared with leflunomide and methotrexate alone (109318).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nArtemisinin, a constituent of Sweet Annie, taken by mouth seems to be poorly absorbed (76778). Artemisinin from Sweet Annie tea seems to have similar bioavailability compared with artemisinin from drug products. However, Sweet Annie tea produces much lower serum concentrations than commercial drug products due to the lower concentration of artemisinin in tea preparations than in drug products (11059). Also, artemisinin is not heat stable. Therefore, the greatest amount of artemisinin is obtained from steeping the leaves rather than boiling (11059). Artesunate, another compound in Sweet Annie, is an unstable compound and likely to be poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (76767).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of the Sweet Annie constituent artemisinin when taken by mouth is around 4.3 hours (76781).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "Anti-allergy effects\nAllergen-specific immunotherapy, such as Sweet Annie sublingual immunotherapy, is a cause-based treatment theorized to help patients develop immune tolerance for the allergen (such as Sweet Annie pollen) and thereby prevent or reduce allergy symptoms when exposed to the pollen in the environment (112393).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome laboratory research shows that Sweet Annie extracts have anti-inflammatory effects (3184). In an animal diabetic model, Sweet Annie extracts reduced levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 (109317). In vitro research also suggests that the essential oil of Sweet Annie aerial parts has antioxidant effects (39578).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in Sweet Annie for cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that artemisinin and quercetagetin 6,',3',4'-tetramethyl ether might have cytotoxic effects against some tumor cells (3183, 76765). Artesunate seems to be most active against leukemia and colon cancer cell lines, even cell lines resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, or hydroxyurea (76747). The mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nAntidiabetic effects\nSweet Annie is of interest for diabetes. In an animal diabetic model, Sweet Annie extracts improved insulin resistance and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and reduced levels of free fatty acids and inflammatory factors (109317).\nAntimalarial effects\nTea preparations of Sweet Annie are commonly used to treat malaria (11059). The exact mechanism of Sweet Annie for treating malaria is unknown. Some research indicates that artemisinin is activated in the food vacuole of the malaria parasite causing oxidative damage. Other research indicates that artemisinin might inhibit specific calcium transporters in the parasite leading to cell death (11056). Laboratory research also suggests Sweet Annie extracts have antipyretic effects (3184). However, the mechanism behind this effect is unclear.\nBacteriostatic effects\nSome laboratory research shows that Sweet Annie extracts have bacteriostatic properties, with artemisinin being responsible for these effects (3184).

            "Overview": "Sweet cherry is a tree. This species of cherry is native to Europe and western Asia but is now cultivated throughout the world (93197). The sweet cherry fruit is commonly used in foods; it is also used in dietary supplements. The Bing sweet cherry is the most common sweet cherry cultivar in the US, and Washington state grows more sweet cherries than any other state. Around 60% of sweet cherries grown are consumed as whole fruit, while 40% are juiced, canned, frozen, or dried (93197).",

Although there has been interest in using oral sweet cherry for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of sweet cherry for this condition.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral sweet cherry is beneficial for obesity.\nA small clinical study in adults with obesity shows that consuming sweet cherry juice as 50 mL concentrate and 3-gram powder in 150 mL water twice daily for 30 days modestly lowers blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, sweet cherry does not reduce body weight or body mass index when compared to baseline (111723).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of sweet cherry.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of sweet cherry is the fruit. Sweet cherry fruit is a good source of fiber, potassium, and vitamins. Consuming 15 sweet cherries (100 grams) provides around 2.1 grams of fiber, and 222 mg potassium. Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene are found in smaller amounts (93197). Glucose and fructose are also present (102135). Sweet cherry also contains phenolic compounds including flavonoids such as epicatechin and quercetin, anthocyanins such as cyanidine, peonidine, and pelargonidin, and hydroxycinnamic acids such as caffeoylquinic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid (102135). The amounts of the constituents of sweet cherry vary with the variety, climatic conditions, harvest time, and harvest year (93197, 102135).\nAnti-gout effects\nThere is some interest in using sweet cherry to treat gout. Preliminary clinical research shows that consuming a single dose of sweet cherry 280 grams (about 45 sweet cherry fruits) can decrease plasma urate and increase urinary urate in healthy women. The mechanism of action is unclear, although it may be due to increased glomerular filtration and/or reduced tubular reabsorption of urate (94713). An in vitro study shows that a methanolic extract of sweet cherry fruit inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid production (102135). It is unknown if sweet cherry has effects on uric acid and urate in people with gout.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consumption of 45 sweet cherry fruits (280 grams) daily for 28 days decreases some markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and nitric oxide, compared to baseline in healthy adults. These effects are thought to be related to the anthocyanins and polyphenols found in sweet cherry fruit (94712).\nAntidiabetes effects\nSweet cherries have a low glycemic index compared to many other fruits, including grapes, peaches, plums, and blueberries. Further, some phytochemicals in sweet cherry are thought to lower blood glucose (93197). However, consumption of sweet cherry 280 grams (about 45 sweet cherry fruits) daily for 28 days does not alter fasting plasma glucose or insulin concentrations in healthy adults (94712).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nIn animal research, ingestion of high levels of fructose in the diet provides substrates for lipogenesis in the liver, and increases activity of transcription factors which regulate genes involved in lipid synthesis. These changes increase lipid accumulation in organs and serum triglyceride levels, while decreasing serum high-density lipoprotein levels. Addition of sweet cherry fruit or leaves to a high-fructose diet in rats reduces these adverse effects on liver and serum lipids, and increases the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in the liver (102134).\nAntioxidant effects\nSweet cherry fruit has antioxidant activity, which is likely due to anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds found in the fruit (14056, 14058, 93197, 102134, 102135).\nCardiovascular effects\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials in healthy adults or adults with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming oral sweet or sour cherry juices, 130-480 mL daily, does not affect systolic or diastolic blood pressure (109658). The effects of sweet cherry, specifically, are unclear.\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn adults with obesity, drinking dark sweet cherry juice prevents the increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria and promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium (116152).\nRadioprotective effects\nPreliminary animal research shows that oral administration of sweet cherry fruit 450 mg/kg daily for 15 days protects against gamma radiation in mice. Although the mechanism is unknown, it may be due to sweet cherry's antioxidant effects (94711)."

It is unclear if dietary citrus fruits are beneficial in patients with asthma.\nThere is some evidence that consumption of vitamin C-rich citrus fruits, including sweet orange and others, might improve lung function in people with asthma. However, this is controversial. Some studies show that intake of citrus fruits 1-2 times per week produces significant benefit (6049, 6055, 6056), while other studies have not found this benefit (6057, 6058).\nless\nCommon cold.

Sweet orange has also been studied as part of a combination aromatherapy. A very small clinical study in community-dwelling older adults shows that massage therapy to the upper body with sweet orange, lavender, and bergamot oils twice weekly for 8 weeks improves symptoms of depression in 65% of patients when compared with no intervention. Twice weekly inhalation of the same essential oils via nebulizer, without massage, also improves symptoms of depression in 55% of patients when compared with no intervention (98474).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia.

This effect was not seen with 250-500 mL of sweet orange juice. Because consumption of this large amount of juice daily provides approximately 20% of the daily energy requirement, this regimen may not be practical (3340).\nless\nInsomnia.

It is unclear if drinking sweet orange juice or taking oral sweet orange extract improves weight loss or other metabolic parameters in adults with overweight or obesity. Most studies suggest that any effects are unlikely to be considered clinically relevant.\nSome preliminary clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking a specific sweet orange extract (Morosil, Bionap S.R.L.) 400 mg orally once daily for six months reduces waist circumference, body weight, fat mass, and body mass index (BMI) by 2% to 5% when compared with placebo (110046). However, other preliminary clinical research in this population shows that drinking red sweet orange juice 750 mL daily for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight or BMI when compared with baseline (92309). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults, most of whom were overweight or obese at baseline, shows that drinking 250-750 mL of various types of sweet orange juice daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, waist circumference, or body fat percentage (BFP) when compared with control groups, which included either no supplementation, pomegranate juice, or exercise (107853). The validity of this meta-analysis is limited due to the population heterogeneity and variety of orange juice formulations and controls utilized.\n\nSome clinical studies have also evaluated sweet orange juice for improving cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese adults. Although some research has shown benefit, not all research agrees (110046, 110047). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with overweight or obesity shows that drinking sweet orange juice 250-600 mL daily for 2-13 weeks modestly increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decrease average systolic blood pressure by 1 mmHg when compared with control. However, drinking sweet orange juice does not affect other blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels, or markers of insulin resistance (110048). The validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity and a small sample size. In addition, these improvements are unlikely to be considered clinically relevant.\n\nSweet orange extract has also been studied in combination with other ingredients.

In an animal model, sweet orange juice decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by 31% (17605). Fexofenadine manufacturer data indicates that concomitant administration of sweet orange juice and fexofenadine results in larger wheal and flare sizes in research models. This suggests that sweet orange reduces the clinical response to fexofenadine (17603). Theoretically, this occurs due to short-term inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (7046).

Separate administration by at least 4 hours.\nClinical research shows that consuming sweet orange juice inhibits OATP, which reduces bioavailability of oral drugs that are substrates of OATP (17603, 17604). For example, sweet orange juice decreases bioavailability of fexofenadine, a substrate of OATP, by about 72% and of celiprolol, another OATP substrate, by up to 90% (7046, 12115). Since sweet orange juice seems to affect OATP for a short time, recommend separating drug administration and consumption of sweet orange juice by at least 4 hours (17603, 17604).\nless\nP-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nSweet orange juice seems to modulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which might affect the blood levels of P-gp substrates.\nAnimal and in vitro research suggest that orange juice extract inhibits drug efflux by P-gp, increasing absorption and levels of P-gp substrates (12116, 15327). In contrast, pharmacokinetic research in humans shows that drinking large amounts of sweet orange juice decreases absorption and levels of the P-gp substrate celiprolol. This suggests that orange juice actually induces drug efflux by P-gp or affects drug levels by another mechanism such as inhibiting the gut drug transporter called organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (7046, 12115).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, drinking a specific sweet orange juice product (Tropicana Products, Inc) 8 ounces three times daily for 3 weeks significantly increases vitamin C, folate, carotenoid and flavonoid concentrations in plasma (15329).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of sweet orange are the peel, juice and fruit. Orange peel contains essential oil and bitter principles. Limonene is the most abundant monoterpene in sweet orange (4946). Sweet orange juice contains significant amounts of vitamin C, carotenoids including xanthophylls and cryptoxanthins, folate, and flavonoids such as hesperidin and hesperetin, naringenin, naringen, nobiletin, and tangeretin (15327, 15329). Red sweet orange contains lycopene (92309).\nAnti-asthma effects\nPotential benefits of sweet orange fruit in asthma have been attributed to antioxidant properties of vitamin C or other fruit constituents (6049, 6054, 6055).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe flavonoid constituents naringin and nobiletin, found in sweet orange, might have anti-inflammatory activity (1281). In human research, drinking red sweet orange juice reduces markers of inflammation in the blood (92309). A meta-analysis in adults shows that drinking a variety of different sweet orange juices as part of a regular diet does not reduce levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or vascular adhesion molecule-1 (107853).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical research conducted in adults, most of whom did not have diabetes, suggests that regular consumption of various types of sweet orange juice might modestly improve insulin resistance, particularly in healthy adults and with treatment durations longer than 8 weeks (107853).\nAntilipemic effects\nOne meta-analysis of clinical research in adults, most of whom had normal cholesterol levels at baseline, suggests that daily consumption of various types of sweet orange juice for 2-12 weeks might modestly reduce levels of total cholesterol, particularly with the use of higher doses (≥500 mg daily) and longer treatment durations (> 8 weeks) (107853).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human research, drinking red sweet orange juice increases markers of antioxidant status in the blood (92309).\nBlood pressure effects\nSweet orange is a source of potassium. High potassium intakes are thought to reduce the risk of developing hypertension and stroke (1310). However, one meta-analysis of clinical research in adults, most of whom were normotensive at baseline, shows that regular consumption of various types of sweet orange juice daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce diastolic or systolic blood pressure (107853).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using dietary sweet orange for preventing cardiovascular complications in patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. One small clinical study in overweight or obese adults shows that drinking blood orange juice 200 mL twice daily for 2 weeks modestly increases flow-mediated dilation when compared with drinking a control drink with the same amount of sugar (105454). Additionally, sweet orange is a source of potassium. High potassium intakes are thought to reduce the risk of developing hypertension and stroke (1310).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nSweet orange juice does not seem to affect cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (12116).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using sweet orange juice to increase satiety. Sweet orange juice may have differing effects on satiety depending on the type of fat with which it is consumed. A small study in healthy adults suggests that drinking 500 mL of sweet orange juice along with muffins high in saturated fat results in lower appetite and hunger scores when compared with drinking sweet orange juice and equicaloric muffins high in monounsaturated fats (105453).\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide effects\nSome researchers suggest that sweet orange juice inhibits the drug transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (7046). However, other research suggests that sweet orange juice increases OATP mRNA and protein levels, but does not inhibit OATP (14348). The flavonoid hesperidin is thought to be responsible for sweet orange's effect on OATP (17604).\nP-glycoprotein effects\nThere are conflicting data about the effects of sweet orange juice on P-glycoprotein. In animal models and in vitro, an ethyl acetate extract of sweet orange juice seems to inhibit drug efflux by P-glycoprotein (12116, 15327). Theoretically, this would increase absorption of certain drugs that are transported by P-glycoprotein (12116). However, in humans, drinking large amounts of sweet orange juice seems to decrease absorption and blood levels of celiprolol. This suggests that sweet orange juice affects P-glycoprotein by actually inducing drug efflux by P-glycoprotein (12115).\nPrebiotic effects\nA small study in humans shows that drinking sweet orange juice daily for 2 months modestly increases the growth of intestinal anaerobes, especially Lactobacillus, resulting in an increase in production of the short-chain fatty acid acetic acid (101186).\nRenal effects\nSweet orange and sweet orange juice are used for kidney stones due to their citrate content. Sweet orange provides citrate in a concentration of about 11 grams/kg. Citrate inhibits the formation of calcium-based kidney stones. The citrate levels in sweet orange are significantly less than lemon which contains about 49 grams/kg; however it is similar to other fruits such as grapefruit (14 grams/kg), pineapple (6 grams/kg), cranberry (11 grams/kg), or raspberry (17 grams/kg) (15170, 15171). Consuming sweet orange products seems to increase urinary citrate levels (15171). Theoretically, this might result in decreased incidence of calcium kidney stone formation.\n\nThere is speculation that the potential benefits of these fruits for decreasing kidney stone formation might differ due to other factors. Lemon provides higher citrate amounts, but the citrate is complexed with a proton, which might decrease its ability to alkalize the urine. Comparatively, the citrate content in sweet orange is primarily complexed with potassium. When lemonade and orange juice products are diluted to contain an equal amount of citrate, orange juice appears to raise urinary pH and urinary citrate more than lemonade (15171).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using sweet orange juice and hesperidin, a flavonoid found in the peels of citrus fruits, for weight loss. However, two separate meta-analyses of clinical research in various patient populations, some of whom were overweight or obese at baseline, shows that drinking 250-1000 mL of a variety of different sweet orange juices daily, or taking oral hesperidin 500-1000 mg daily, for 2-12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, or waist circumference (105280, 107853)."

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nSyrian rue overdose typically presents with neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal sequelae. Several cases of Syrian rue toxicity have presented with severe neurologic effects, including altered consciousness, ataxia, tremors, peripheral neuropathy, and coma (28513, 29977, 107441, 107442). Hallucinations and agitation are also likely to occur (28229, 28513, 107441). Renal and hepatic impairment or failure have been reported, as well as bradycardia, hypertension, and tachycardia (28229, 29977, 107441, 107442). A retrospective analysis of 200 cases of Syrian rue poisoning indicates that the risk of fatality is 6.2% following the ingestion of large amounts of Syrian rue (29978). While the dose of Syrian rue leading to overdose is not well established, teas containing 100 grams of Syrian rue seeds have been associated with toxicity in some cases (28229, 107442).\nTreatment\nTreatment of Syrian rue overdose is mostly supportive in nature (28229, 28513, 107441, 107442). In some cases, intubation and hemodialysis have been required (29977, 107441).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Excretion\nIn humans, following ingestion of Syrian rue seeds, beta-carboline alkaloids are detected in the urine (28513).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Syrian rue are the entire plant, including the seeds (100155, 100156). Constituents of Syrian rue include the beta-carbolines (gamma-harmine, harmine, harmaline, or harmidine, harmol, harmalol, harmane, and tetrahydroharmine), the quinazoline derivatives vasicine, vasicinone, deoxyvasicinone, peganole, peganidine, peganine, peganones, peganetin, and deoxypeganine, as well as hydroxytryptamine derivatives, anthocyanins and flavonoids (28388, 28551, 28552, 28553, 28555, 28556, 28557, 28559, 28560, 28561)(28562, 28564, 100155, 100156). The highest levels of beta-carbolines are found in the seeds and roots, with lower levels in the green parts of the plant (28388). Flavonoids have been isolated from aerial parts of the plant (28563).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that Syrian rue extracts have anti-inflammatory effects, although the mechanism of these effects is unknown (107440).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn laboratory and animal research, Syrian rue seed extract or beta-carboline alkaloid constituents of Syrian rue (harmane, harmaline, harmalol, harmine) have been found to exert antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria (28351, 28352, 28353, 28354, 28356, 28361, 28511, 28525). In E. coli, the inhibitory effects of Syrian rue constituents were in the order of: harmane > harmaline > harmalol = harmine (28352). Antibacterial effects may also be due to flavonoid constituents, such as quercetin and kaempferol, which are found in the plant (28525). Although the mechanisms of action are not completely clear, harmaline is reportedly a potent inhibitor of the sodium/proton (NhaB) antiporter from Escherichia coli (28357).\nAntidepressant effects\nIn animal research, harmine induced antidepressant effects, as evidenced by reduced immobility time and increased climbing and swimming time, without affecting locomotor activity (28385, 28387). In vitro and in animal research, constituents of Syrian rue have been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity (28388, 28528, 28536, 28537, 28538). In animal research, harmine increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels (28385, 28386, 28387) and reversed stress-induced mood disturbances, possibly by increasing adrenal gland weight and normalizing ACTH circulating levels (28386).\nAntifungal effects\nIn laboratory research, Syrian rue extract or beta-carboline alkaloid constituents of Syrian rue (harmaline and harmine) have shown antifungal activity (28351, 28356, 28525). Antifungal effects may also be due to flavonoid constituents, such as quercetin and kaempferol, found in the plant (28525). Although the mechanisms of action are not completely clear, laboratory research suggests that harmaline inhibits yeast invertase (28566).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn animal and in vitro research, Syrian rue or its alkaloid constituents have been found to exert anticancer activity (28355, 28371, 28372, 28373, 28374, 28376, 28377, 28378, 28380, 28381)(28383, 28510, 28567, 100156). In some studies, harmine was the most potent (28376, 28380, 28568). These compounds have been found to induce apoptosis (28372, 28373, 28381, 28568) and inhibit proliferation (28355, 28376, 28377, 28378, 28567) and angiogenesis (28510). It is believed that these effects occur due to the ability of Syrian rue to regulate inflammatory mediators and/or alter cellular messaging (28373, 28374, 28379, 28380, 28391, 28510, 28567).\nAntinociceptive effects\nIn animal research, the alkaloid extract of Syrian rue was found to exert antinociceptive effects, possibly in an opioid-related manner (28393, 28505).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that Syrian rue extracts have antioxidant effects, although the mechanism of these effects is unknown (107440).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn animal and in vitro research, Syrian rue seed extract and beta-carboline alkaloids (harmane, harmaline, harmalol, harmine) have demonstrated activity against blood parasites including Theileri, Babesia bigemina, Anaplasma marginale, Leishmania, Plasmodium, and others (28352, 28358, 28365, 28366, 28367, 28368, 28396, 28397, 100156). Harmane and harmine possibly inhibit parasitic cell division and internalization within macrophages (28366, 28368).\nCentral nervous system effects\nSyrian rue seeds can cause stimulant and hallucinogenic effects, as well as severe neurotoxicity in humans (28229, 29977). In animals, the constituent harmaline has been shown to reduce learning, induce memory deficits, and cause neurotoxicity, including tremor, trembling, and jumping (28344, 28346, 28372, 28574, 28576, 28577). The pathogenesis of harmaline- and harmine-induced tremors involves the serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems, hypermetabolism of glucose, effects on sodium channels, and increased corticotrophin releasing factor (28348, 28524, 28527, 28531, 28534, 28542, 28547, 28549, 28578, 28580)(28581, 28582, 28583, 28584, 28590)."
