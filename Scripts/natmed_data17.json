            "Overview": "Padang cassia is a shrub or small tree found in Southeast Asia and cultivated in the Philippines and Indonesia. The dried bark comes in the form of rolls and quills and is used for flavoring and cooking. Powdered Padang cassia bark is used in traditional medicine (93139, 93145). When used for medical purposes, different species of Cinnamomum should not be confused or used interchangeably. While most published clinical research focuses on cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum aromaticum) and Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), Padang cassia is less expensive and is sometimes used as a replacement for other Cinnamomum species in the US market. In fact, from 2007-2012, 90% of the cinnamon imported to the US was Padang cassia (93122).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts typically found in food. Padang cassia has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when Padang cassia is used orally and appropriately as a medicine, short-term (93117, 93118, 93147, 92848, 92849, 108268). A specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) has been used with apparent safety at doses up to 1500 mg daily for 6 months (93117, 93118, 93147). Padang cassia powder has been used with apparent safety at doses of up to 2000 mg daily for 8 weeks (108268).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses, long-term. Padang cassia bark contains higher levels of coumarin than other cinnamon species (93121, 93122, 93123). Coumarin can cause hepatotoxicity in animal models (15299, 21920). In humans, very high doses of coumarin, about 50-7000 mg daily, can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin use is discontinued (15302). In most cases, ingestion of Padang cassia will not provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity; however, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease, prolonged ingestion of large amounts of Padang cassia might exacerbate the condition.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Padang cassia when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy and breast-feeding; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Padang cassia appears to be well tolerated. No adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials when Padang cassia is used alone (93117, 93147). When Padang cassia extract is used with banaba leaf extract in a specific combination product (Inlacin, Dexa Medica), adverse effects reported in clinical trials have included dizziness, headache, tremor, palpitations, weakness, diaphoresis, and stomach upset. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects were caused by Padang cassia extract, banaba leaf extract, or the combination (92848, 92849).\n\nPadang cassia contains coumarin. There is some concern that ingesting large amounts of Padang cassia and its coumarin constituent might cause hepatotoxicity in some people, especially those with pre-existing liver disease (93121, 93122, 93123).\nCardiovascular\nOrally, a specific product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) has been reported to cause palpitations. However, it is unclear if this adverse effect was caused by Padang cassia extract, banaba leaf extract, or the combination (92848).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, a specific product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) has been reported to cause stomach upset. However, it is unclear if this adverse effect was caused by Padang cassia extract, banaba leaf extract, or the combination (92849).\nless\nHepatic\nPadang cassia contains coumarin. There is some concern that ingesting large amounts of Padang cassia might cause hepatotoxicity in some people due to its coumarin content (93121, 93122, 93123). In otherwise healthy humans, very high doses of coumarin, from 50-7000 mg daily, can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin use is discontinued (15302). In clinical trials, taking Padang cassia powder 2 grams daily for 8 weeks or the extract (Cinnulin PF) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks did not significantly increase aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels when compared with placebo (93147, 108268). In most cases, ingestion of Padang cassia won't provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity; however, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease, there is concern that prolonged ingestion of large amounts of Padang cassia might exacerbate liver dysfunction.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, a specific product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) has been reported to cause dizziness, headache, tremor, and weakness. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects were caused by Padang cassia extract, banaba leaf extract, or the combination (92848, 92849).\nless\nOther\nOrally, a specific product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) has been reported to cause diaphoresis. However, it is unclear if this adverse effect was caused by Padang cassia extract, banaba leaf extract, or the combination (92849).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. A small clinical study in adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes despite the use of two oral antidiabetes medications shows that taking a specific product containing a combination of the extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 100 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.65% when compared to baseline. This combination product also reduced systolic blood pressure by 7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg (92849). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Additionally, it is not clear if these effects are due to Padang cassia, banaba, or the combination.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Taking products containing Padang cassia and other ingredients may help stabilize blood glucose in patients with prediabetes. However, evidence is preliminary, and it is unclear if the benefits are due to Padang cassia, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 5.7% to 6.4% shows that taking cinnamon 500 mg, consisting of Padang cassia bark powder 200 mg and bark extract from other cinnamon species 300 mg (Solgar, Inc.), three times daily for 12 weeks attenuates an increase in fasting plasma glucose when compared with placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo group showed an increase in fasting plasma glucose of 4.5 mg/dL, while patients in the treatment group showed no significant increase. Also, during an oral glucose tolerance test, patients taking the cinnamon product showed a reduction in the plasma glucose area under the curve and the 2-hour plasma glucose level when compared to baseline (101519). Another preliminary clinical study in adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking a specific product containing a combination of the extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 50-100 mg daily for 12 weeks improves insulin sensitivity and postprandial plasma insulin levels when compared with placebo. However, improvements in fasting or postprandial glucose levels were not observed (92848).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks increases lean body mass by 1.4 kg and reduces body fat percentage by 1% when compared with placebo. Taking this combination product also reduces fasting plasma glucose by 11-13 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg when compared with placebo (93118, 93147).\nObesity. Preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks increases lean body mass by 1.4 kg and decreases body fat percentage by 1% when compared with placebo (93118, 93147).\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Preliminary clinical research in women with PCOS shows that taking a specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 500 mg three times daily for 6 months improves menstrual cyclicity but does not improve insulin resistance or androgen levels when compared with placebo (93117).\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). A small clinical trial in patients with RA shows that taking Padang cassia powder 1 gram twice daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces overall disease activity, pain, and the number of tender and swollen joints, as well as some inflammatory markers, when compared with placebo (108268).\nMore evidence is needed to rate Padang cassia for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDiabetes: A specific combination product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks has been used (92849).\n\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes): A specific combination product containing extracts of Padang cassia and banaba leaf (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 50-100 mg once daily for 12 weeks has been used in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (92848). Another product (Solgar, Inc.) containing cinnamon bark extract (Cinnamomum spp) 300 mg and Padang cassia bark powder 200 mg three times daily for 12 weeks has been used in patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or HbA1c levels of 5.7% to 6.4% (101519).\n\nMetabolic syndrome: A specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks has been used (93118, 93147).\n\nObesity: A specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks has been used (93118, 93147).\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): A specific Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) 500 mg three times daily for 6 months has been used (93117).\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA): Padang cassia powder 1 gram twice daily for 8 weeks has been used (108268).\nStandardization & Formulation\nA specific water-soluble Padang cassia extract (Cinnulin PF, Integrity Nutraceuticals International) is standardized to contain at least 3% doubly-linked polyphenol type-A polymers. Some research suggests that these polymers are the bioactive components of Padang cassia and that 50 mg of this extract is equivalent to around 1 gram of Padang cassia powder (93129, 93131).",

Theoretically, concomitant use with other potentially hepatotoxic products might increase the risk of developing liver damage. Some of these products include androstenedione, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, germander, kava, niacin, pennyroyal oil, red yeast, and others.\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nPadang cassia might lower blood glucose levels (93118, 93127, 93147, 92848, 92849).

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "No toxic effects were reported in acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies of rats receiving a methanol extract of Padang cassia. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) for this extract was 2000 mg/kg daily, and the lethal dose (LD50) of this extract was more than 2000 mg/kg daily (93125).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Padang cassia.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nWhile the bark of Padang cassia is the primary part of the plant used medicinally and as a flavoring agent, other components such as the leaves, root, and fruit have also been used traditionally for some medical conditions. The bark and leaves contain a variety of chemical constituents including trans-cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, coumarin, eugenol, cinnamyl acetate, cinnamyl alcohol, flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol), polyphenols (e.g., proanthocyanidins, epicatechins), and amides (e.g., cinnabutamine, cinnaretamine) among many others (93120, 93121, 93122, 93137, 93138). Trans-cinnamaldehyde is the primary volatile compound found in Padang cassia bark and leaves. This constituent is responsible for the characteristic aroma and flavor of cinnamon. Trans-cinnamaldehyde content in the bark of Padang cassia ranges from 12.4-63.8 grams/kg. Coumarin content in Padang cassia bark ranges from 2.1-9.3 grams/kg, which tends to be higher than is found in other cinnamon species (93121, 93122).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that Padang cassia bark extract has antibacterial activity (93136, 93137, 93139, 93142). In one study, a crude Padang cassia extract and its individual constituents demonstrated antibacterial activity against the following foodborne pathogens: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella anatum, and Staphylococcus aureus (93136, 93137). In another in vitro study, an extract of essential oils from Padang cassia demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus (93139).The antioxidant effects of Padang cassia may explain its antibacterial activity (93136).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that Padang cassia bark extract may have anticancer effects (93145, 93146). In one study, Padang cassia bark extract showed chemopreventive potential via its effects on the Nrf2/ARE pathway (93146). In another in vitro study, Padang cassia bark extract and trans-cinnamaldehyde were shown to inhibit the proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (93145).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that Padang cassia and its constituents have antidiabetes effects (11247, 11248, 93128, 93129, 93132, 93133, 93134, 93135). A variety of mechanisms to explain these effects have been proposed. These include increased insulin sensitivity via phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (11248, 93135), regulation of genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose transport (11247, 11248, 11249, 93129, 93132, 93133, 93134, 93135), and inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (93128). However, in a small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medications, taking an aqueous Padang cassia extract as a single dose did not affect maximum or overall glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test when compared with a control group (108267).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that Padang cassia bark and fruit have antioxidant activity (93136, 93140, 93141, 93142, 93143). In a study comparing the antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of 20 dietary spices, including Padang cassia bark, only the clove spice (Eugenia caryophylata) had greater antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content than Padang cassia (93136). Antioxidant effects of Padang cassia were also found in one clinical study (108267).\nGastroprotective effects\nSome preliminary in vitro research suggests that a specific fraction (DLBS2411) of Padang cassia may have gastroprotective effects, possibly via inhibition of gastric H+/K+ ATPase activity (93143).\nLipid effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that Padang cassia can improve dyslipidemia, possibly by regulating the expression of genes involved in insulin, inflammatory, and lipoprotein signaling pathways (93129, 93130, 93131). In mice fed a high-fat diet for 28 days, administering a Padang cassia extract on days 15-28 of the diet reduced total cholesterol levels when compared with the diet alone (104801)."

Pagoda tree contains rutin, quercetin, sophoricoside, sophorabioside, and genistein. The flower and buds are high in rutin and quercetin and are also sources of kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and triterpenoids. The flowers, fruits, and seeds also contain genistein, and the fruit is high in the genistein glycosides sophoricoside and sophorabioside (67491, 67493, 96765, 99964, 99965, 99966, 106343).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that pagoda tree fruit extract has anti-inflammatory effects. In a rat model of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, pagoda tree fruit extract reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta (103244). In a rat model of arthritis, pagoda tree flower extract decreased levels of the inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and rheumatoid factors, as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of antioxidant enzymes was increased. These changes were associated with decreases in pain and inflammation (106343). Similarly, a study of mice with induced colitis shows that administering pagoda tree extract inhibits nuclear factor- kappa B (a target marker in inflammatory bowel disease) and reduces levels of other inflammatory markers, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha (111736).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that pagoda tree extract can protect human keratinocytes from ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation-induced injury and apoptosis (99964).\nMenopausal effects\nClinical research shows that pagoda tree fruit might be beneficial for some types of menopausal symptoms. Pagoda tree fruit is a source of the genistein glycosides sophoricoside and sophorabioside (99966). Genistein glycosides are thought to act like genistein, and might be beneficial for various menopausal symptoms, including bone loss (99965, 99966).\nProstatic effects\nAnimal research shows that pagoda tree fruit extract might be beneficial for treating prostatic hyperplasia. In a rat model of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), pagoda tree fruit extract reduced prostate weight and the number of prostatic acini. These effects may be explained by the impact of pagoda tree on the expression of certain growth factors. Pagoda tree mitigated the increase in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production and decrease in transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) production reported in the AAH-induced rat control group. The anti-inflammatory activity of pagoda tree is also thought to explain these effects (103244)."

Crude or virgin palm oil, obtained by direct compression of the fruit, is called \"red palm oil\" due to its high beta-carotene content. Refined palm oil is obtained by bleaching, deodorization, and neutralization of crude palm oil. Palm kernel oil is derived from the palm seed or kernel and is higher in saturated fat than palm oil (94913, 94918, 104101).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in food amounts. Palm oil can be safely consumed as a component of the diet (14031, 14032). However, palm oil should not be considered a healthy alternative to other saturated fats. Palm oil contains more saturated fat than animal-based fats, including lard and butter, and increased consumption of palm oil has been associated with a higher risk for mortality from ischemic heart disease (14021, 17739, 94918, 94920). Therefore, like all saturated fats, palm oil should be used in moderation.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term.

Palm oil has been used with apparent safety in clinical studies in children under 5 years of age at doses of 6 grams daily for up to 6 months and in children 5 years of age and older at doses of 9 grams daily for up to 12 months (14032, 34466, 67509, 67534, 67571, 97572).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Diets rich in palm oil or supplemented with palm oil have been used safely during the third trimester of pregnancy (14030, 14031, 14032).\nLACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of palm oil when used in medicinal amounts during lactation; avoid amounts in excess of those found in foods.",

Some research suggests that diets rich in palm oil can increase levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with diets rich in monounsaturated and/or polyunsaturated fatty acids (106719). When substituted for other saturated fats in the diet, palm oil reduces total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels better than myristic and lauric acids, but increases these when compared with stearic acid (67533, 67569, 94913, 94919). However, meta-analyses of studies in healthy individuals show that palm oil has no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol or triglycerides when compared with unsaturated fatty acids, although it may increase HDL cholesterol in these individuals (103847, 103848). If substituted for trans fatty acids, palm oil increases HDL cholesterol levels, with no impact on total or LDL cholesterol levels. When substituted for hydrogenated vegetable oils, the effect of palm oil on cholesterol levels is neutral. The effect of palm oil on cholesterol levels, regardless of the comparator fat source, appears to be more pronounced with older age, higher total intake of fat in the diet, and higher baseline cholesterol levels (94913).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, red palm oil may cause carotenosis (also called carotenoderma), which is a yellow to yellow-orange discoloration of the skin caused by increased serum carotenoids and their subsequent deposition in the outermost layer of skin (14053). Due to the lipophilic nature of the carotenoids, the onset may be delayed and persist for up to 5 months after ceasing red palm oil consumption (67547).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn one clinical study, infants fed formula containing palm olein oil (a palm oil derivative) had reduced bone mineral content and bone mineral density at 3 and 6 months when compared with infants fed milk-based formula. However, this reduction is not considered clinically significant, as the values for all infants were within the normal range (14033).\nless",

It is unclear if oral palm oil is beneficial in children with malaria.\nDietary consumption of palm oil by children under 5 years of age in developing countries where malaria is endemic does not seem to be associated with a reduced severity of malaria (14034).\n\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of palm oil for this use.\nless\nVitamin A deficiency. Oral palm oil is likely effective for preventing or treating vitamin A deficiency.\nClinical studies in pregnant individuals and in children in developing countries shows that dietary supplementation with red palm oil reduces the risk of developing vitamin A deficiency and treats existing vitamin A deficiency (14030, 14031, 14032, 34466, 34474, 67509, 67510, 67511, 67534, 67571). A meta-analysis of these and other clinical studies primarily involving children or those who are pregnant or lactating shows that taking red palm oil increases levels of serum retinol, a marker of vitamin A status, by 0.09 mcmol/L and reduces the rate of vitamin A deficiency by 45% when compared with placebo. Intake of red palm oil appears to be comparable to taking vitamin A supplements for preventing vitamin A deficiency. Red palm oil in doses of about 3-8 grams daily seems to be most beneficial; higher intake does not appear to have additional benefit (97572).\n\nIn children 5 years of age or under and in children over 5 years of age, red palm oil in doses of up to 6 grams daily and in doses of up to 9 grams daily, respectively, has been used for up to 6 months (14032, 67571). In children 7-12 years of age, red palm oil 14 grams three times weekly for about 9 weeks also has been used (67534).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nPalm oil triglycerides are digested and absorbed similarly to other dietary fats (67566). However, the location of palmitic acid in palm oil triglycerides is different than the triglycerides in animal fats, potentially resulting in reduced absorption (94919). Antioxidant-rich palm oil consumption also results in the absorption of carotenoids and tocopherols (14028, 14053, 67532, 67571).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPalm oil is obtained from the fruit of the oil palm tree. Unrefined or crude palm oil is called red palm oil. The red color is due to its higher content of alpha- and beta-carotenes when compared with refined palm oil (103849). Impurities removed from palm oil by refining include phospholipids, free fatty acids, gums, and lipid oxidation products. Refined palm oil contains more than 95% triacylglycerols, less than 0.5% free fatty acids, and a low impurity content (103850). The fatty acids which make up the triacylglycerols in palm oil from the traditional African palm are saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid, 44% to 50%), monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid, 39% to 40%), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid, 10% to 11%). It also contains short- and medium-chain triglycerides, and very small amounts of myristic acid, which is also found in butter and coconut oil (14021, 17739, 94918, 103847). The oil from a hybrid of African and American oil palms is lower in palmitic acid and higher in oleic acid (94917). The oil derived from the kernel (palm kernel oil) is 80% saturated fatty acids (94918).\n\nPalm oil is semi-solid at room temperature and is relatively stable against oxidative deterioration due its low percentage of linoleic acid (103847). It can be fractionated into a liquid component called palm olein, which is used in cooking oils and margarines, and a solid component called palm stearin, which is used in shortenings and butter substitutes (103850). Palm olein contains slightly higher levels of oleic and linoleic acids when compared with palm oil (103847).\n\nPalm oil and red palm oil also contain alpha- and beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-sitosterol, and vitamin E (14020, 14022, 14023, 14028, 17739, 94918). The vitamin E in palm oil includes various isomers of tocopherols and tocotrienols including alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocotrienol, gamma-tocopherol, gamma-tocotrienol, and delta-tocotrienol (14052). Palm oil provides 74% to 80% tocotrienols and 20% to 26% tocopherols (14043, 14046, 17739, 104101).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn obese or overweight individuals, taking 45 grams of red palm olein or palm olein daily for 6 weeks does not alter levels of inflammatory markers (103849).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA small clinical study in healthy young adults shows that short-term consumption of a palm-oil enriched snack is associated with increased markers of insulin resistance and decreased markers of insulin sensitivity when compared with a monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched snack (106720).\nAntioxidant effects\nPalm oil and its water soluble extract are high in phenolic acids and flavonoids and appear to have antioxidant activity (14024, 14038, 14050, 67590). Research in animals suggests that antioxidant-rich palm oil and red palm oil, as well as their palm olein derivatives, might reduce ischemic-reperfusion injury, possibly through antioxidant mechanisms (14041, 14042, 17739). In obese or overweight individuals, taking 45 grams of red palm olein daily for 6 weeks increases levels of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene when compared with palm olein. It also decreases levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis (103849).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary research in animal models suggests that red palm oil provides protection against atherosclerosis, oxidative stress, ischemia, and heart disease (14036, 17739, 17740, 17741, 17742). Research in animals also suggests that antioxidant-rich palm oil and red palm oil, as well as its palm olein oil derivative, might reduce ischemic-reperfusion injury (14041, 14042, 17739). Other animal research suggests that palm oil rich in antioxidant vitamins might lower blood pressure (14038). However, processed palm oil appears to increase blood pressure in animal models of hypertension (94921). Preliminary research suggests that processed palm oil is atherosclerotic (14036). Unlike fish oil and canola oil, palm oil does not seem to reduce aortic wall thickness in hypertensive animals (14040). Also, in humans, increased dietary consumption of palm oil is associated with an increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease, but not stroke (94920).\n\nPalm olein, a derivative of palm oil, seems to increase platelet aggregation (14037). However, the effect of palm oil on platelet aggregation is not clear. In an animal model of diabetes, palm oil increases the rate of cardiomyocyte death compared with sunflower oil (14044).\nCarotenoid effects\nVitamin A can be formed from carotenoids (14025, 14026). A palm oil derivative, carotene-rich palm oil, increases levels of alpha- and beta-carotene (14053). Because of its high carotenoid content, palm oil has been proposed as a means of preventing vitamin A deficiency. Preliminary research suggests that palm oil carotene increases immune system activity by increasing peripheral natural killer (NK) cells and B-lymphocytes, and suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells (14045).\nLipid effects\nThe effect of palm oil on lipids is unclear. A large meta-analysis of low to moderate quality studies in a mixed population of healthy individuals and those with hypercholesterolemia shows that diets rich in palm oil are associated with increases in levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with diets rich in monounsaturated and/or polyunsaturated fatty acids (106719). Another smaller meta-analysis of studies in healthy individuals shows that palm oil has no significant effects on levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with unsaturated fatty acids, but increases levels of HDL cholesterol by a mean of 6 mg/dL (103848).\n\nWhen substituted for saturated fats in the diet, palm oil appears to reduce total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels better than myristic and lauric acids, but increases these levels when compared with stearic acid (67533, 67569, 94913, 94919). If substituted for trans fatty acids, palm oil increases HDL cholesterol levels, with no impact on total or LDL cholesterol levels. Palm oil appears to be more hypercholesterolemic in older adults or in people with existing hypercholesterolemia (94913). Two palm oil derivatives, red palm olein and refined palm olein, might also increase total and LDL cholesterol (14029). However, animal research shows that red palm oil reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to supplementation with coconut oil (17739, 17743). A meta-analysis of studies in healthy individuals shows that palm olein has lipid effects comparable to those of unsaturated dietary oils (103847). Also, small clinical studies suggest that red palm oil rich in antioxidants does not impact cholesterol levels in the same way as processed oil, due to the presence of tocotrienols and beta-carotene (3238, 67522).\nNutritional effects\nPalm oil is used in infant formulas to achieve palmitic acid levels similar to those in human milk. However, the triacylglycerols in palm oil typically have the palmitic acid moieties forming esters with glycerol at the SN-1 and SN-3 positions, while human milk has palmitic acid at the SN-2 position, There are now some infant formulas with a greater proportion of palmitic acid at the SN-2 position, but there is insufficient evidence that these provide better nutrition than formulas containing palm oil (103850).\nSkin permeability enhancing effects\nIn vitro research shows that crude palm oil and its tocotrienol-rich fraction enhance the permeation of drugs such as ibuprofen across human skin (104101)."

Oral PEA seems to reduce pain and improve function in patients with osteoarthritis.\nClinical research in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking PEA (Levagen, Gencor Pacific) 300 mg or 600 mg daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks modestly improves function and reduces pain, stiffness, and the need for rescue analgesics when compared with placebo. The worst reported pain from the day prior was reduced by 40% to 50% in patients taking PEA, compared with no improvement in those taking placebo. Also, the number of patients reporting no pain in the previous 24 hours was more than doubled in those taking PEA when compared with placebo (106274).\nless\nPain (chronic). Oral PEA seems to reduce pain in patients with chronic pain due to various causes.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research, as well as one observational study, shows that taking micronized or ultramicronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group) 300-1200 mg daily for up to 60 days reduces pain in people with chronic pain due to various causes, regardless of the use of other analgesics. The meta-analysis estimated a five-fold reduction in pain every two weeks in patients using PEA when compared to control. Estimates also suggest that pain reduction to a score of less than or equal to 3 is approximately twice as likely to occur in patients using PEA when compared to control (93314, 93320). A more recent meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with pain of various etiologies taking PEA 300-1200 mg for 10-180 days did not find any further pain reduction with the use of higher doses or longer durations. There was also no difference in pain reduction when compared with either a placebo control or a non-placebo control (101327). The validity of these findings is limited by the variability of the studies in the analysis and the lack of differentiation between patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nSpinal cord injury. Oral PEA does not seem to reduce pain or spasticity associated with spinal cord injury.\nClinical research shows that taking ultramicronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group SpA) 600 mg sublingually twice daily for 12 weeks as add-on pain therapy does not reduce neuropathic pain, spasticity, or insomnia in patients with pain and spasticity associated with spinal cord injury when compared with using conventional pain treatments (93370).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease).

There was no effect on skin redness or integrity (106271).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for autism.\nA small clinical study in children aged 4-12 years with autism and moderate to severe irritability shows that taking PEA 600 mg twice daily for 10 weeks as an adjunct to treatment with risperidone improves irritability and hyperactivity, but does not seem to affect lethargy/social withdrawal, inappropriate speech, or stereotypic behavior, when compared with placebo and risperidone (101338).\nless\nCannabis use disorder. Although there is interest in using oral PEA for cannabis withdrawal, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this condition.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with moderate severity carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking PEA 600 or 1200 mg daily in divided doses for 30 days reduces or delays discomfort when compared to no treatment (93377). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of an adequate comparator group. Another small preliminary clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking ultra-micronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group S.p.A) 1200 mg daily prior to carpal tunnel surgery improves sleep disturbance and pain when compared with control. Two 600 mg sachets of the product were used daily for 10 days, followed by two 600 mg tablets daily for 50 days. The treatment regimen was then continued for another 90 days, but there was no difference between groups with regard to sleep and pain outcomes during this period (101333).\n\nPEA might not work as well in patients with milder carpal tunnel syndrome. A clinical study in patients with low to moderate severity carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking PEA 300 mg twice daily for 60 days does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo (101334).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Although there is interest in using oral PEA for CKD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this condition.\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical study in patients with CP/CPPS shows that taking a specific combination product containing PEA 300 mg with alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg (Peanase) daily for 12 weeks improves lower urinary tract symptoms, pain, and quality of life, but does not improve erectile function, when compared with taking saw palmetto 320 mg (101336). It is not clear if these effects are due to PEA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial in patients with disturbed sleep patterns.\nA clinical study in healthy adults with disturbed sleep patterns shows that taking a specific formulation of oral PEA (Levagen+) 350 mg nightly, one hour prior to sleep, for 8 weeks does not improve the quality of sleep when compared with placebo. However, treatment with PEA shortens the time needed to fall asleep at weeks 4 and 8 when compared with placebo (107807). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCognitive impairment. Although there is interest in using oral PEA for cognitive impairment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this condition.\nComplex regional pain syndrome.

It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for recovery of smell following COVID-19 infection.\nCOVID-19 infection has been associated with persistent smell or taste disorder. In patients with olfactory impairment lasting at least 90 days after a confirmed negative COVID-19 test, a small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking PEA 700 mg plus luteolin 70 mg (Glialia, Epitech pharmaceutical) daily for 30 days in combination with olfactory rehabilitation modestly improves olfactory recovery, based on threshold, discrimination, and identification, when compared with olfactory rehabilitation alone. However, patients randomized to PEA plus luteolin had worse olfactory status at baseline and had experienced olfactory impairment for about twice the duration as those in the control group. These baseline differences may have confounded any findings (106270).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for depression when used in combination with citalopram.\nA small clinical trial in patients with major depressive disorder shows that, in addition to citalopram, taking ultra-micronized PEA 600 mg twice daily for 6 weeks results in at least a 50% improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) in all patients, compared to about 75% of patients in the group receiving placebo and citalopram. However, there was no between-group difference in complete remission rates (101335).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking a specific type of micronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group srl) 300 mg twice daily for 60 days reduces neuropathic pain when compared with baseline (93335). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if eye drops containing PEA are beneficial for dry eye.\nObservational research in patients with glaucoma and dry eye has found that applying specific PEA eye drops (Defluxaa), one drop in each eye twice daily for 30 days, is linked to improved tear stability and tear production (101332).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if topical PEA is beneficial for dry skin.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with pruritus related to dry skin shows that applying a lotion containing PEA (Physiogel Calming Relief) twice daily for 14 days does not reduce itchiness, roughness, or scaling when compared with applying the vehicle alone (106272).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adolescents and young adults with primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking a combination of PEA 400 mg plus trans-polydatin 40 mg daily for 10 days, starting on the 24th day of the cycle, modestly reduces pelvic pain when compared with placebo. Also, approximately 98% of patients taking PEA had some pain reduction, compared with 56% of those taking placebo (106273).\nless\nEndometriosis. Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical and observational research in patients with endometriosis-related pain shows that taking micronized PEA 400 mg and trans-polydatin 40 mg twice daily for 3 months moderately improves pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea and modestly improves pain with intercourse when compared with placebo (101337). However, taking the same specific combination of PEA 400 mg plus polydatin 40 mg (Pelvilen, Epitech Group Srl) daily for 3 months was not as effective as taking celecoxib 200 mg twice daily for 7 days. Satisfaction with treatment is comparable between PEA and celecoxib (101407).\n\nLimited research has also assessed PEA in combination with alpha-lipoic acid. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of PEA 300 mg and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 6-9 months reduces endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and improves quality of life and sexual function when compared to baseline (93379). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA small clinical study in young males shows that taking a drink containing PEA 150 mg (as Levagen+) plus maltodextrin 832.5 mg before, immediately after, and 3 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after an exercise session designed to cause muscle damage modestly reduces myoglobin levels, a marker of muscle damage, in the 3-hour post-exercise period when compared with taking maltodextrin 1 gram. However, there were no effects on levels of creatine kinase or inflammatory cytokines over 72 hours (106267).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small clinical study in young males shows that taking a drink containing PEA 150 mg (as Levagen+) plus maltodextrin 832.5 mg before, immediately after, and 3 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after an exercise session designed to cause muscle soreness does not reduce muscle soreness in the 72-hour post-exercise period when compared with taking maltodextrin 1 gram (106267).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for fibromyalgia.\nRetrospective and prospective observational research in patients with fibromyalgia who are taking duloxetine and pregabalin shows that taking micronized or ultramicronized PEA (PEA-m or PEA-um, Epitech Group) 600-1200 mg daily for 3 months reduces pain and tender points when compared with duloxetine and pregabalin alone (93338). The validity of these findings is limited by poor study design and the lack of a placebo control.\nless\nGlaucoma. Taking oral PEA seems to have a small beneficial effect on intraocular pressure. However, it is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for glaucoma.\nIn patients with normal-tension glaucoma, preliminary clinical research shows that taking ultramicronized PEA 600 mg in divided doses for 6 months reduces intraocular pressure by 3.3 mmHg and improves visual field indices without impacting visual acuity when compared to baseline (93378). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with stable open-angle or normal tension glaucoma already using standard topical therapy shows that taking PEA (Visimast) 600 mg daily for 4 months modestly improves the function of retinal ganglion cells, intraocular pressure, and quality of life when compared with not taking PEA. However, in this study there was no effect on the visual field (106268).\n\nPEA has also been evaluated for the general reduction of intraocular pressure. In patients undergoing bilateral laser iridotomy for the prevention of primary closed-angle glaucoma, a small clinical study shows that taking a specific PEA product (Visimast, Epitech Group Srl) 300 mg twice daily for 15 days prior to surgery prevents a rise in intraocular pressure within 2 hours of surgery when compared with placebo (93323). In patients with ocular hypertension but without other symptoms of glaucoma, preliminary clinical research shows that taking PEA 300 mg twice daily for 90 days reduces levels of intraocular pressure by approximately 3% when compared to baseline (93326). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral PEA for IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for these conditions.\nInterstitial cystitis. Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in males and females with interstitial cystitis and chronic bladder pain shows that taking a product containing micronized PEA 400 mg plus polydatin 40 mg (Pelvilen Forte, Epitech Group SpA) twice daily for 3 months, and then once daily for an additional 3 months, modestly reduces pain intensity, urgency, and frequency when compared with baseline. The pain reduction was maintained for at least an additional 2 months (106269). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with IBS shows that taking PEA 200 mg and polydatin 20 mg (EP1844784, Epitech group Srl) twice daily for 12 weeks reduces abdominal pain severity but does not affect other gastrointestinal symptoms when compared with placebo (101331). It is not clear if these effects are due to PEA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for reducing the frequency and severity of migraines in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with migraine without aura shows that taking ultra-micronized PEA 300 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces the frequency of migraine attacks by at least 50% in about 64% of patients when compared with baseline. The intensity of migraine attacks was reduced by approximately 30%, with an 80% reduction in the number of patients experiencing a severe migraine attack (106266). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for MS.\nAnecdotal evidence from case reports has suggested that PEA can reduce MS-related pain (93319, 93321). Preliminary clinical research in patients with relapsing-remitting MS being treated with subcutaneous interferon-beta1a shows that taking ultra-micronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group SpA) 600 mg daily for 12 months improves some, but not all, symptoms of MS, as well as adverse effects from interferon treatment. However, taking PEA does not seem to improve physical or emotional well-being or overall quality of life (93368).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for improving neuropathic pain.\nSmall, low-quality clinical studies and case series suggest that taking PEA 600-1200 mg daily in divided doses reduces neuropathic pain from various causes, including chemotherapy and trauma. Pain reduction has been reported to occur even if patients are using other treatments or receiving acupuncture (93333, 93336, 93376). The validity of these findings is limited by small study size, poor study design, and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nObesity. Although there is interest in using oral PEA for weight loss, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this use.\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for patients with Parkinson disease using levodopa.\nObservational research in patients with Parkinson disease using levodopa found that taking a specific ultra-micronized PEA product (Normast, Epitech Group SpA) 600 mg twice daily for 3 months, followed by 600 mg once daily for up to one year, is associated with improved symptoms when compared to baseline, such as mood, sleep disturbances, and tremor, and improved activities such as getting out of bed and walking (101328). The validity of these findings is limited by the observational nature of the study and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for reducing postoperative pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing impacted third molar extraction shows that taking a specific type of micronized PEA (Normast, Epitech Group SpA) 300 mg twice daily for 15 days reduces postoperative pain when compared with a control group. PEA reduces pain by 36% and 33% at 3 and 7 days, respectively, when compared with control (93322).\nless\nPrurigo nodularis. Topical PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly individuals with chronic pruritus or prurigo nodularis shows that topical application with a cream containing 10% omental lipids and 'anti-itching' agents, including PEA, twice daily for 4 weeks reduces itching severity by 86% when compared with baseline. Skin barrier function was also improved. Other 'anti-itching agents' included polidocanol and stimutex made up of spent grain wax, shea extract, and Argania spinosa kernel oil (106275). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for preventing respiratory tract infections.\nSome low-quality, clinical studies in adults and children shows that taking a specific type of PEA (Impulsin) up to 1800 mg daily in divided doses for at least 12 days reduces the risk of developing an acute respiratory infection by 32% to 59% (93372, 101412). Retrospective, observational research in children with recurrent respiratory infections shows taking a specific product (Sinerga) containing PEA, bovine colostrum, and phenylethylamine, as one sachet daily for 10-20 consecutive days each month for 4 months, reduces the need for antibiotics. The combination product reduced the need for antibiotic treatment to only 52% of children, compared to 95% of the children taking a probiotic extract (93337). It is not clear if these effects are due to PEA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSciatica. Small clinical studies suggest that oral PEA may be beneficial for reducing pain associated with sciatica.\nSome small clinical studies in patients with sciatica shows that taking PEA 300 mg twice daily for 30 days in conjunction with standard treatment reduces pain and physical aspects of quality of life when compared with standard treatment alone (93374, 93375). Some higher quality clinical research in adults with sciatica and low back pain also shows that taking a specific type of PEA (Normast, Epitech Group srl) 300 mg or 600 mg daily for 21 days reduces pain by 45% to 70% in patients with lumbosciatica, compared to a 30% reduction with placebo (101408, 101409).\nless\nShigellosis. Although there is interest in using oral PEA for shigellosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this use.\nStroke. Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in stabilized, conventionally-treated adults undergoing rehabilitative treatment for a recent stroke shows that taking a specific product (Glialia, Epitech Group SpA) containing ultra-micronized PEA 700 mg and luteolin 70 mg twice daily sublingually for 60 days improves spasticity, pain, and activities of daily living when compared to baseline (93339). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nTourette syndrome. Although there is interest in using oral PEA for Tourette syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of PEA for this use.\nVulvar pain. Oral PEA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with vestibulodynia shows that taking PEA 400 mg plus polydatin 40 mg daily, in conjunction with intravaginal transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy, does not reduce pain more than the use of TENS therapy and placebo (93327).\nless\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMD). It is unclear if oral PEA is beneficial for TMD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking PEA 600-900 mg in divided doses for 14 days improves pain associated with temporomandibular arthritis by 89%, compared to only 46% in patients taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily for 14 days. PEA also increased mouth opening by 11.5%, compared to an increase of 5.5% with ibuprofen (93373).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate PEA for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPEA has most often been used in doses of 300-1200 mg daily in one or two divided doses for 2-12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nPEA is used in creams and lotions. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nOphthalmic:PEA is used in eye drops. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nPEA has most often been used in doses of 300-600 mg once or twice daily for up to 3 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nPEA is available in micronized formulations. Unmodified PEA is approximately 100-700 micron. Micronized PEA is approximately 2-10 micron and ultra-micronized PEA is approximately 0.8-6 micron. These smaller compounds are intended to provide enhanced dissolution and increased absorption (93333, 93335, 93338).\n\nUltra-micronized and micronized PEA are available commercially in sachets or in tablets or capsules (93333, 93336). The capsule may be swallowed whole or the contents can be emptied under the tongue. The contents of the sachets are often poured under the tongue (93332, 93333).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, taking ultra-micronized PEA by mouth increases plasma levels of PEA (93368). Plasma levels increase within 2 hours and return to baseline levels after approximately 4 hours (101406, 101410).\nDistribution\nAnimal research shows that PEA is distributed throughout the brain soon after oral intake, with the majority in the hypothalamus. Intraperitoneal administration resulted in PEA distribution throughout the body, including the adrenals, diaphragm, spleen, kidney, testes, lung, liver, heart, brain, and blood (101406, 101410).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPEA is a fatty acid amide made endogenously in the body by glial and other cells. It also occurs naturally in various foods, including milk and breast milk, egg yolk, beans, and nuts (101410). PEA is made from the fatty acid palmitic acid and ethanolamine. Its production is typically stimulated by stress, inflammation, or injury (93314). PEA is related to anandamide, an endocannabinoid made from arachidonic acid. As a group, the lipid mediators anandamide and PEA belong to a family of acylethanolamides (93319, 93320, 93323, 101402, 101404, 101405, 101410).\nAnalgesic effects\nThere is interest in using PEA for pain. Its analgesic effects are likely related to its local anti-inflammatory effects at the site of nerve injury (93320, 93368, 93371, 101402, 101404). However, PEA might also prolong the action of endocannabinoids by inhibiting the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (93370, 101410). In humans with multiple sclerosis, there is evidence that PEA might reduce the expression of the FAAH gene. Also, levels of the related compounds anandamide and oleoylethanolamide are increased in patients with multiple sclerosis, which possibly relates to the decrease in inflammatory cytokines (93368). It has also been suggested that PEA might desensitize the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) channels on sensory neurons (93319, 101404).\n\nTopical application of PEA also appears to reduce pain. In patients with vulvar pain, it is thought that it targets free nerve endings of the vaginal epithelium, as well as epithelial cells and immunocompetent cells. It is possible that PEA might decrease the production of nerve growth factor and other mediators by more than one type of cell to stop the feedback loop of pain and inflammation (101403).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory and animal research suggests that PEA has anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types and animal models. PEA is thought to have direct effects on various peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). However, it also likely has other effects. These may involve endocannabinoid-mediated mechanisms of action, such as the activation of cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels. This broad mechanism of action might explain the effects of PEA in cells such as mast cells, glial cells, astrocytes, and keratinocytes (92311, 101404, 101410). In general, PEA is thought to inhibit the release of inflammatory compounds from mast cells, activated at the site of nerve injury. This results in an inhibition of further mast cell recruitment, as well as an inhibition of microglial activation and neuropathic pain and edema. The mast cells and glial cells shift from a phase of immune activation to a resting phase. Both administration of PEA, and increasing its levels by blocking endogenous breakdown, result in these effects (93314, 93320, 93368, 93371, 101402, 101404, 101410). In animal and human research, PEA reduces levels of various inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (93368, 101401, 101411). This is possibly related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthases (101404).\n\nIn animal research, micronization of PEA appears to increase its anti-inflammatory effects following oral use (101415).\nEndometrial effects\nIn human research, taking a combination of PEA and polydatin reduces pelvic pain due to endometriosis (93325). In animal research, this combination reduces the development of endometrial lesions, likely by decreasing inflammatory pathways and angiogenesis (101414).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPEA is of interest for inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, which are associated with increased gut permeability and inflammation. In animal and in vitro research, PEA decreases intestinal permeability and inflammation. The mechanism of action appears to involve the TRPV1, CB2, GPR55, and PPAR-alpha receptors (101416, 100879). Research in humans shows that PEA attenuates increased absorption of lactulose and mannitol, which was experimentally induced by aspirin intake (100879).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using PEA in the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Clinical research in adults with ALS shows that taking PEA reduces laboratory measures of skeletal muscle defects. In these patients, PEA appears to reduce the rundown of acetylcholine receptor currents, possibly resulting in improved muscle function (93369).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using PEA for various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer disease and autism spectrum disorder. In an animal model of Alzheimer disease, PEA reduces certain pro-apoptotic pathways, including increased lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. In vitro, PEA protected the neurons and astrocytes that were cultured with amyloid. The PPAR receptors -alpha, -gamma, and -delta all appear to play a role in this neuroprotection (101405). In an animal model of autism, PEA improves behavior. Behavior improvements are associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines in the brain and improved neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (101401).\n\nThere is also interest in using PEA for neuronal protection following stroke. In animal research, PEA reduces the neurological damage following an ischemic stroke, possibly by protecting against neuronal and astrocyte cell death by maintaining levels of brain derived- and glial cell derived-neurotrophic factors and reducing infiltration of mast cells (93339).\nOcular effects\nPEA is found naturally in ocular tissue. It is thought that the anti-inflammatory effects of PEA play a role in the protection of ocular tissue, such as the retina. This might be helpful in diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of PEA likely protect the retina against oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. In animal models with high levels of glucose, PEA might protect against toxicity associated with advanced glycation end products, thereby reducing the activation of the retinal glial cells and others (101405). In human research, possible benefits of PEA might be related to improved peripheral endothelial function as measured by flow mediated dilation (93326)."

            "Overview": "Panax is a genus of slow-growing, deciduous plants that includes 13 different species (89741). While many of these species may be referred to as \"ginseng,\" typically the term \"ginseng\" is associated with the species Panax ginseng (3122, 89741). Panax ginseng grows in Korea, northeastern China, and far-eastern Siberia (3122). It has been used as a calming agent in traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and as an \"adaptogen\" (3122, 8600, 8604, 89738). Adaptogenic herbs are used with the intention of helping the body resist physiological and psychological stress.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Panax ginseng seems to be safe when used for up to 6 months (8813, 8814, 17736, 89741, 89743, 89745, 89746, 89747, 89748, 103044)(103477, 114980, 114981, 114984, 114985). Panax ginseng sprout extract has also been used with apparent safety in doses up to 450 mg daily for up to 12 weeks (114983).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally, long-term. There is some concern about the long-term safety due to potential hormone-like effects, which might cause adverse effects with prolonged use (12537). Tell patients to limit continuous use to less than 6 months.\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Panax ginseng when used topically.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in infants. Use of Panax ginseng in newborns is associated with intoxication that can lead to death (12). There is limited reliable information available about use in older children (24109, 103049); avoid using.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Ginsenoside Rb1, an active constituent of Panax ginseng, has teratogenic effects in animal models (10447, 24106, 24107); avoid using.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Panax ginseng is generally well tolerated when used for up to 6 months. There is some concern about the long-term safety due to potential hormone-like effects.\n\nTopically, no adverse effects have been reported when ginseng is used as a single ingredient. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Insomnia.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Anaphylaxis, arrhythmia, ischemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nCardiovascular\nPanax ginseng may cause hypertension, hypotension, and edema when used orally in high doses, long-term (3353). However, single doses of Panax ginseng up to 800 mg are not associated with changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters or increases in heart rate or blood pressure (96218). There is a case report of menometrorrhagia and tachyarrhythmia in a 39-year-old female who took Panax ginseng 1000-1500 mg/day orally and also applied a facial cream topically that contained Panax ginseng. Upon evaluation for menometrorrhagia, the patient also reported a history of palpitations. It was discovered that she had sinus tachycardia on ECG. However, the patient was a habitual consumer of coffee 4-6 cups/day and at the time of evaluation was also mildly anemic. The patient was advised to discontinue taking Panax ginseng. During the 6 month period following discontinuation the patient did not have any more episodes of menometrorrhagia or tachyarrhythmia (13030). Also, a case of transient ischemic attack secondary to a hypertensive crisis has been reportedly related to oral use of Panax ginseng (89402).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, Panax ginseng may cause itching or an allergic response consisting of systemic rash and pruritus (89743, 89760, 104953, 114984, 114985). Skin eruptions have also been reported with use of Panax ginseng at high dosage, long-term (3353). Uncommon side effects with oral Panax ginseng include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (596).\n\nIn one case report, a 6-year-old male with a previous diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis, which had been in remission for 18 months, presented with recurrent pustular lesions after consuming an unspecified dose of Panax ginseng. The patient was diagnosed with pityriasis amiantacea caused by subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Treatment with oral dapsone 25 mg daily was initiated, and symptoms resolved after 4 weeks (107748). In another case report, a 26-year-old female presented with itchy exanthem and oval erythematous lesions on the face, neck, and abdomen after consuming a decoction containing Panax ginseng, aconite, ginger, licorice, Cassia cinnamon, goldthread, and peony 400 mL twice daily for 1 week. Pityriasis rosea-like eruption was suspected, but the patient refused topical or oral antihistamines or corticosteroids. The patient continued taking the decoction but with Panax ginseng and aconite removed. After 6 days, symptoms began to resolve, and by 17 days symptom improvement was significant (114986). It is unclear if this reaction was due to Panax ginseng, aconite, the combination, or some other factor. Pityriasis rosea typically resolves spontaneously.\n\nTopically, when a specific multi-ingredient cream preparation (SS Cream) has been applied to the glans penis, mild pain, local irritation, and burning have occurred (2537).\nless\nEndocrine\nThe estrogenic effects of ginseng are controversial. Some clinical evidence suggests it doesn't have estrogen-mediated effects (10981). However, case reports of ginseng side effects such as postmenopausal vaginal bleeding suggest estrogenic activity (590, 591, 592, 10982, 10983).\n\nIn a 12-year-old Korean-Japanese male, enlargement of both breasts with tenderness in the right breast (gynecomastia) occurred after taking red ginseng extract 500 mg daily orally for one month. Following cessation of the product, there was no further growth or pain (89733). Swollen and tender breasts also occurred in a 70-year-old female using Panax ginseng orally (590).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, Panax ginseng can cause decreased appetite (3353), constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia (3353, 89734, 103477, 112841, 114980, 114985), abdominal pain (89734, 87984, 112841, 114985), and nausea (589, 87984). However, these effects are typically associated with long-term, high-dose usage (3353). Some evidence suggests that fermented Panax ginseng is more likely to cause abdominal pain and diarrhea when compared with unfermented Panax ginseng (112841).\nless\nGenitourinary\nAmenorrhea has been reported with oral use of Panax ginseng (3353).\n\nTopically, when a specific multi-ingredient cream preparation (SS Cream) has been applied to the glans penis, sporadic erectile dysfunction and excessively delayed ejaculation have occurred (2537). Less commonly, patients can experience vaginal bleeding (591, 592, 3354, 23630).\nless\nHepatic\nIt is unclear if Panax ginseng is associated with adverse hepatic effects. Cholestatic hepatitis has been reported in a 65-year old male following oral use of a combination product containing Panax ginseng and other ingredients (Prostata). However, it is unclear if this adverse effect was due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination (598). An elevation in liver enzymes has been rarely reported in clinical research (114985).\nless\nImmunologic\nA case of anaphylaxis, with symptoms of hypotension and rash, has been reported following ingestion of a small amount of Panax ginseng syrup (11971).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, one of the most common side effects to Panax ginseng is insomnia (589, 89734, 111336, 114985). Headache (594, 23638, 112840, 114985), vertigo, euphoria, and mania (594) have also been reported. Migraine and somnolence occurred in single subjects in a clinical trial (87984). In a case report of a 46-year-old female, orobuccolingual dyskinesia occurred following oral use of a preparation containing black cohosh 20 mg and Panax ginseng 50 mg twice daily for menopausal symptoms. The patient's condition improved once the product was stopped and treatment with baclofen 40 mg and clonazepam 20 mg daily was started (89735).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. In middle-aged individuals, but not young adults, oral Panax ginseng seems to improve abstract thinking, attention, arithmetic skills, and reaction time. Any benefit to memory seems to be dependent on the inclusion of ginkgo.\nSome clinical evidence shows that taking Panax ginseng orally can improve abstract thinking, attention, mental arithmetic skills, and reaction times in healthy, middle-aged people; however, Panax ginseng does not seem to improve these outcomes in young adults (2064, 23596, 23599, 23608, 23609, 54374). While Panax ginseng alone does not seem to improve memory (2064), there is some evidence that a combination of Panax ginseng (G115) and ginkgo leaf (GK501) extract 80-320 mg daily for 12 weeks can improve memory in otherwise healthy people or people with neurasthenia 38-66 years of age (8591, 9759, 87984, 88046). In clinical trials, various doses have been used. These include a specific Panax ginseng extract (G115, Pharmaton SA, Lugano) 200-400 mg once daily or in two divided doses for up to 12 weeks, or 200-960 mg administered as a single dose (8591, 23596, 23599, 23608, 23609, 54374, 88046). Another extract (Gerimax Ginseng Extract; Dansk Droge A/S Ishoj) 400 mg daily for 8 weeks has also been used (2064).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral Panax ginseng seems to improve sexual function in people with ED.\nTaking Panax ginseng orally for 8 weeks seems to improve sexual function in adults with ED (8813, 23637, 23638, 89747). Doses used in clinical research have included extract from the juice and pulp of 4 year-old Panax ginseng berry 700 mg twice daily (89747), tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract 1000 mg twice daily (23638), and Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, 1000-2700 mg daily (8813, 112840).\n\nPanax ginseng has also been studied in adults with symptoms of ED that are associated with an enlarged prostate. A small clinical study in adult males with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms shows that taking a specific extract of Korean red ginseng (RXGIN, Jung Kwan Jang), a type of Panax ginseng, 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks improves symptoms of sexual dysfunction including erectile function, sexual desire, orgasmic function, and intercourse satisfaction when compared with placebo. However, there was no improvement reported in overall satisfaction. Most symptoms of ED except sexual desire had not significantly improved by 6 weeks, suggesting that longer durations of at least 12 weeks may be needed for Panax ginseng to significantly improve ED symptoms (112840).\n\nAdditionally, Panax ginseng has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing Panax ginseng 150 mg, L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone (114989). It is unclear if this effect is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, including the use of per-protocol analysis and lack of a placebo group.\nless\nInfluenza. Oral Panax ginseng seems to modestly reduce the risk of developing influenza. However, it might not reduce the severity or duration of symptoms.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng extract (G115) 200 mg daily, beginning 4 weeks prior to influenza vaccination and continuing for 8 weeks thereafter, can decrease the relative risk of getting the flu or common cold by 65% when compared with placebo (589). Also, clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking Panax ginseng extract 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks reduces the relative risk of developing an acute influenza infection by 45% when compared with placebo. However, taking Panax ginseng does not seem to affect symptom duration or severity (89746).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. Oral Panax ginseng seems to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.\nClinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng 250 mg twice daily for 3 months improves symptoms of fatigue and quality of life when compared with placebo in female patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Females taking Panax ginseng experienced a 75% reduction in fatigue, compared with no change in the placebo group; quality of life was increased by 19.9 points in the Panax ginseng group, compared with only 4.2 in the placebo group (89745).\nless\nSexual arousal. Oral Panax ginseng, alone or in combination with other ingredients, seems to improve sexual arousal in postmenopausal adults or females with sexual dysfunction.\nTaking Korean red ginseng, a specific form of Panax ginseng, 3 grams daily for 8 weeks seems to improve sexual arousal and satisfaction when compared with placebo in postmenopausal adults (23630). Also, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (ArginMax for Women, Daily Wellness Company) containing ginkgo leaf extract, Panax ginseng root extract, damiana leaf extract, L-arginine, multivitamins, and minerals for 4 weeks can improve sexual satisfaction when compared with placebo in females who are self-reported to have sexual dysfunction (23635, 46933). It is unclear if this effect is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Most research shows that oral Panax ginseng does not improve athletic performance.\nTaking Panax ginseng 0.4 to 3 grams daily orally for up to 8 weeks, or as a single dose 200 mg one hour prior to exercise, does not improve aerobic exercise capacity (1427, 4230, 4231, 23646, 23647, 89737, 114981). Higher doses of Panax ginseng also do not seem to improve athletic performance. A small study in young athletes shows that taking Panax ginseng 100 mg/kg (about 5-7 grams, standardized to 10% ginsenosides) daily in three divided doses for 8 days does not improve squat exercise performance, although it might modestly improve perceived exertion, when compared with placebo (103045). Similarly, a small clinical study in adult male recreational athletes shows that taking Panax ginseng extract 500 mg daily for 14 days does not improve 10-kilometer running times when compared with placebo (114981).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in age-related cognitive decline.\nClinical research in patients over 50 years of age with memory impairments shows that taking standardized ginseng extract (G115) in combination with vitamins, minerals, and dimethylaminoethanol bitartrate may improve memory when compared to baseline (23600). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these changes are due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in allergic rhinitis.\nA small clinical study in adults with allergic rhinitis shows that taking Panax ginseng (Korean Ginseng Corporation) 3 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks improves rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and eye itch when compared to baseline (103047). The validity of this study is limited because it did not report statistical comparisons between the treatment and control groups.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral Panax ginseng might improve cognitive performance in patients with this condition.\nClinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng root 4.5 to 9 grams daily for 12 weeks can improve cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer disease when compared with control (23611, 23612). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of patient and caregiver blinding.\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. Topical Panax ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with androgenic alopecia shows that applying 1 mL of a topical combination product (Hirsuit hair tonic, Dermcor Pharmaceutical) containing Panax ginseng extract, biochanin A (from red clover), acetyl tetrapeptide-3, Salvia officinalis oil, and other ingredients, twice daily for 24 weeks, is similarly effective to minoxidil 3% solution for increasing hair count and mass (105672). It is unclear if the benefit is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng protects against anthracycline cardiotoxicity.\nA very small clinical study in adults with non-metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer being treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in Iran shows that taking Panax ginseng rhizome powder 1000 mg daily starting on the first day of doxorubicin administration until one week after completion of the eighth doxorubicin cycle improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 1% when compared with placebo, which was associated with a 7% reduction in LVEF. Treatment with Panax ginseng also reduces the incidence of chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction when compared with placebo, an effect that endured over a 6-month follow up period. However, Panax ginseng did not improve the cardiac biomarker high-sensitive cardiac troponin I or transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of left atrium diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, or left ventricular end-diastolic diameter when compared with placebo (112817).\nless\nAnxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nAplastic anemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for aplastic anemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral Panax ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small low-quality study in children with ADHD aged 6-12 years shows that taking Panax ginseng extract 3 mg with omega-3 fatty acids 500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves overall symptoms, reduces errors of commission, and improves reaction time when compared with baseline (103049). The validity of this study was limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these changes are due to Panax ginseng, omega-3 fatty acids, or the combination.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for treating lower urinary tract symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms shows that taking a specific extract of Korean red ginseng (RXGIN, Jung Kwan Jang), a type of Panax ginseng, 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and improves most prostate symptoms including residual urine sensation, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia after 6 and 12 weeks when compared with placebo. However, there was no improvement in maximum urinary flow rate or post-void residual volume when compared with placebo (112840).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in breast cancer.\nObservational research in Chinese patients with breast cancer suggests that regular use of ginseng, including either Panax ginseng or American ginseng, is associated with higher quality of life scores and a lower risk of overall mortality, breast cancer-related mortality, and breast cancer recurrence when compared with patients who do not take ginseng (14466). However, ginseng users were also significantly more likely to have been treated with tamoxifen. Another small clinical study in adults with non-metastatic breast cancer undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy in Iran shows that taking Panax ginseng 1 gram daily starting on the first day of chemotherapy until 1 week after completion of the final cycle at 7 or 10 weeks improves social, emotional, and functional measures of health-related quality of life but does not improve physical well-being when compared with placebo (112823).\nless\nBronchitis. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in bronchitis.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng extract (G115) 100 mg twice daily for 9 days might be beneficial when used adjunctively for treating acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Panax ginseng, combined with antibiotic therapy, might reduce bronchial bacterial counts more than antibiotic therapy alone (8814).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in preventing cancer. However, it might increase quality of life in some cancer patients.\nObservational research has found that taking ginseng orally might decrease the incidence of cancer, specifically breast, stomach, lung, liver, ovarian, and skin cancer (2063, 3122). But evidence from large-scale clinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng 1 gram once weekly for 3 years does not reduce the risk of cancer development (23622). However, some clinical research suggests that Panax ginseng may slow cancer progression or improve quality of life in patients already diagnosed with cancer. One clinical study shows that taking sun ginseng, a form of Panax ginseng that has been heat treated, 3000 mg daily orally for 12 weeks can improve quality of life for cancer patients (23643). Evidence from a case series suggests that giving Panax ginseng (also called Cultivated Wild Ginseng Pharmacopuncture) 20 mL daily by intravenous infusion for up to 13 cycles lasting 2-4 weeks each may attenuate the progression of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in some patients (23619, 23620).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in cancer-related fatigue.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng 400 mg twice daily for 4 weeks reduces fatigue in 63% of adults with cancer-related fatigue when compared to baseline. Panax ginseng also reduces pain and improves appetite and overall quality of life when compared to baseline. The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings (96217). Another clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer receiving the mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen shows that taking Panax ginseng 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks improves fatigue as measured on the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) when compared with placebo. However, when evaluated on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale, no benefit was seen (103048).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in patients with severe CFS.\nA nonblinded, observational study in patients with severe CFS, most of whom also have fibromyalgia, shows that taking Panax ginseng daily for one month improves patient reports of energy, overall wellbeing, mental clarity, sleep, pain, and stamina when compared with baseline. Patients took Panax ginseng either as capsules (Terry Naturally HRG80 Red Ginseng Energy capsules; EuroPharma, Inc) 200-400 mg daily or chewable tablets (Terry Naturally HRG80 Red Ginseng Energy chewable tablets; EuroPharma, Inc) 100-200 mg daily. There were no dose- or formulation-dependent differences between groups (107746). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of randomization and placebo-control; additionally, the majority (89%) of patients included in this study were female.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng prevents CKD.\nA cross-sectional study in Korea suggests that supplemental Panax ginseng or American ginseng use is associated with a higher prevalence of CKD when compared with no supplemental ginseng use. However, no association was found when adjusting the results for potential confounders (112810). The applicability of these results is limited by a lack of subgroup analysis on the type of supplemental ginseng.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral Panax ginseng has primarily been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for improving symptoms of COPD; its effect when used alone is unclear. Taking Panax ginseng doesn't seem to prevent exacerbations.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with stable COPD shows that taking Panax ginseng, usually in combination with other ingredients as part of TCM formulations, significantly improves pulmonary function tests and quality of life when compared with placebo after 3-6 months of treatment. These formulations improve COPD symptoms by approximately 53% when compared with placebo. However, they only modestly improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (17736). In contrast, Panax ginseng might not reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations. A clinical study in patients with moderate to very severe COPD shows that taking Panax ginseng 200 mg does not reduce the rate of acute COPD exacerbations over 12 months (103044).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of cognitive impairment. Most research has evaluated Panax ginseng in combination with other ingredients.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a specific combination product (Memo, Pharco Pharmaceuticals), which contains natural lyophilized royal jelly 750 mg, standardized ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg, and standardized Panax ginseng root extract 150 mg, orally for 4 weeks improves memory when compared with placebo (89712). It is unclear if these benefits are due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nA moderate-sized clinical study in older adults with subjective memory impairment shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng sprout extract (ThinkGIN, BTC Corporation) 450 mg daily for 12 weeks improves performance on some verbal and visual memory tests and cognitive function as measured with MoCA-Korean version when compared with placebo (114983).\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in preventing the common cold.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng extract (G115) 200 mg daily orally beginning 4 weeks prior to influenza vaccination and continuing for 8 weeks thereafter can decrease the relative risk of getting the flu or common cold by 65% when compared with placebo (589).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in CHF.\nA small clinical study in adults with CHF shows that Panax ginseng 2 grams daily, with or without digoxin 0.25 mg once daily for 15 days, seems to improve heart function according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification when compared to baseline. Ginseng might also improve hemodynamics and may work synergistically with digoxin (4243). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral fermented Panax ginseng is beneficial for constipation.\nAn observational study in healthy postmenopausal adults aged 50 years and older in Korea suggests that taking fermented red ginseng 20 mL before meals daily for 3 weeks normalizes stool consistency and increases the frequency of bowel movements when compared to baseline (112837). The validity of these effects is limited by the observational study design, lack of a comparator group, and insufficient blinding.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if Panax ginseng is beneficial in depression.\nIn adults with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, a small clinical study shows that taking Panax ginseng 2 grams daily in addition to current antidepressant medications for 6 weeks produces remission in 39% of patients and decreases scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale by a mean of 44% when compared with baseline (104954). The reliability of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group, randomization, blinding, and an intention-to-treat analysis, as well as a high drop-out rate.\nless\nDiabetes. Research on the use of oral Panax ginseng for improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes is inconclusive and conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes using Panax ginseng for 4-24 weeks and 3 small trials using American or unidentified ginseng for 4-8 weeks, shows that taking these ingredients modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, but does not affect glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or insulin levels, when compared with control (105689). This analysis is limited by publication bias, as well as the heterogeneity and imprecision of the included trials. Another meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with a variety of metabolic disorders including diabetes and prediabetes shows that taking Panax ginseng 200 mg up to 8 grams daily for 4 to 24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin levels when compared with placebo. However, Panax ginseng might improve glucose AUC in these individuals. Subgroup analysis further suggests that the beneficial effect of Panax ginseng on glucose AUC is greater in adults with diabetes than those with prediabetes (112838).\n\nIndividual small studies have shown modest glycemic benefit with fermented Panax ginseng 2.7 grams daily for 4 weeks or non-fermented Panax ginseng 6 grams daily for 8-12 weeks (23627, 89740), and other studies have shown no benefit with Korean red ginseng extract or Korean black ginseng 2-8 grams daily for 4-6 weeks (17734, 112839). It is unclear if the effects of Panax ginseng may be dose- or product-dependent.\n\nPanax ginseng has also shown some glycemic benefit when used in combination with other ingredients. Panax ginseng extract 750 mg (standardized to 30% ginsenosides) has been used in combination with American ginseng extract 1500 mg (standardized to 10% ginsenosides), viscous fiber 10 grams, and ground white chia seeds 60 grams daily for 24 weeks (105673). It is unclear if this benefit is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in diabetic neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking Panax ginseng extract powder 1 gram daily for 24 weeks seems to improve sensory perception of electric currents, a marker for severity of diabetic neuropathy, when compared with baseline (103051). The validity of this study was limited by the lack of statistical comparison between treatment and placebo groups.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for exercise-induced muscle damage, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nFatigue. Most clinical research shows that oral Panax ginseng can reduce fatigue in adults with idiopathic chronic fatigue. However, not all research agrees.\nSome clinical research in patients with idiopathic chronic fatigue or self-reported fatigue shows that taking Panax ginseng improves self-reported fatigue when compared with baseline or placebo (89743, 23623, 106665). A small clinical study in patients with idiopathic chronic fatigue shows that taking an ethanolic extract of Panax ginseng 1 gram twice daily for 4 weeks reduces self-reported fatigue by 66% and mental fatigue by 50% when compared with placebo (89743). Another clinical study in adults with chronic fatigue also shows that taking a specific combination product containing Panax ginseng (G115) 80 mg, vitamins, and minerals daily for 7 weeks alleviates fatigue symptoms in 20% more patients when compared with placebo (23623). However, not all research has been positive. A small clinical study in middle-aged patients with idiopathic chronic fatigue shows that taking Panax ginseng, steamed and aged for six years, 3 grams daily for 6 weeks is no different than placebo for reducing fatigue (103052). Notably, this clinical trial had a robust placebo effect.\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for fibromyalgia.\nClinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng root extract 100 mg daily orally for 12 weeks does not improve pain, fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety, tender point count, or quality of life when compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia (89744).\n\nA nonblinded, observational study in patients with fibromyalgia, most of whom also have severe chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), shows that taking Panax ginseng daily for one month improves patient reports of energy, overall wellbeing, mental clarity, sleep, pain, and stamina when compared with baseline. Patients took Panax ginseng, either as a capsule (Terry Naturally HRG80 Red Ginseng Energy capsules; EuroPharma, Inc) 200-400 mg daily, or chewable tablet (Terry Naturally HRG80 Red Ginseng Energy chewable tablets; EuroPharma, Inc) 100-200 mg daily. There were no dose- or formulation-dependent differences between groups (107746). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of randomization and placebo-control; additionally, the majority (89%) of patients included in this study were female.\nless\nGallbladder disease. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for gallbladder disease.\nClinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng 7.5 grams as an adjuvant to the bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 500 mg daily plus ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 500 mg daily, divided into three doses daily for 24 weeks, does not decrease the total volume of gallstones or increase gallstone dissolution when compared to use of bile acids alone (89748).\nless\nGastritis. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for gastritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for glaucoma.\nA clinical crossover study in patients with glaucoma shows that taking oral Panax ginseng 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks improves dry eye severity, daytime visual function, and eye pain when compared with placebo. In a sub-group of patients with early or moderate glaucoma, nighttime visual function was also improved (107744). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment.\nless\nHalitosis. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for halitosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, 2.7 grams daily for 10 weeks helps reduce bad breath when compared with baseline, particularly in patients with bad breath caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection (23624). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHangover. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for hangover.\nOne small clinical study shows that drinking 100 mL of a drink containing Panax ginseng extract 0.321 mg/mL within 5 minutes of drinking 100 mL blended Scotch whiskey with 40% alcohol and eating a piece of cheese may reduce hangover symptoms by approximately 66% when compared with placebo in healthy males. Levels of alcohol in the blood also appear to be reduced (89742).\nless\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for hearing loss.\nPreliminary clinical research in male textile workers exposed to continuous noise shows that taking Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, 200 mg daily for 14 days reduces temporary hearing loss caused by noises at frequencies of 4, 6, or 16 kHz when compared with control. However, Panax ginseng may be slightly less effective than N-acetyl cysteine at preventing temporary hearing loss caused by noise at 4 kHz frequency (89739).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with HIV shows that taking Korean red ginseng, a particular form of Panax ginseng, along with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) modestly increases CD4 count, but does not affect viral load, when compared with HAART alone (23625).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with a variety of metabolic disorders shows that taking Panax ginseng 200 mg to 8 grams daily for 4 to 24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 7 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL but does not reduce triglycerides or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (112838). However, a meta-analysis of up to 28 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with a variety of metabolic disorders shows that taking Panax ginseng 300 mg to 6 grams daily for 3 to 32 weeks does not reduce total or LDL cholesterol or triglycerides or increase HDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (114985).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with a variety of metabolic disorders shows that taking Panax ginseng 200 mg to 8 grams daily for 4 to 24 weeks does not reduce systolic (SBP) or diastolic (DBP) blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analysis suggests that Panax ginseng might modestly reduce SBP in people with prehypertension, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome (112838).\n\nSmaller individual studies of various forms of Panax ginseng have been evaluated in patients with mild to severe hypertension with conflicting results. Some preliminary clinical research in patients with essential hypertension shows that taking Panax ginseng 4.5 grams daily in three divided doses, alone or with a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker for 8 weeks, moderately decreases 24-hour SBP (23632). However, in patients with prehypertension or mild hypertension, taking protopanaxatriol-enriched Panax ginseng (Ginseol K-g1) 100 mg or 300 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce seated SBP or DBP when compared with placebo (89741).\n\nPanax ginseng has also been evaluated in combination with American ginseng. Clinical studies in patients with hypertension with or without type 2 diabetes show that taking Panax ginseng 0.75 grams and American ginseng 1.5-2.25 grams enriched to contain 30% total ginsenosides daily for 12 weeks reduces central SBP by about 5 mmHg and 24-hour SBP by about 4 mmHg, but does not impact DBP, when compared with placebo or a control of wheat-bran (103046, 107745). Patients receiving this combination also have greater reductions in daytime SBP, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels when compared with control (107745). It is unclear if these effects are due to Panax ginseng, American ginseng, or the combination; additionally, it is unclear if enrichment with ginsenosides alters clinical effects.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance.\nIn overweight adults with prediabetes, a small clinical study shows that taking hydrolyzed Panax ginseng extract, 320 mg three times daily before meals for 6 months, does not improve fasting blood glucose levels. However, compliance in this study was only 49% (104953). Additionally, a large, cross-over, clinical study in patients with prediabetes initiating a lifestyle intervention shows that taking a Chinese herbal medicine preparation containing Panax ginseng providing ginseng berry saponins 50 mg three times daily for 4 weeks improves 2-hour post-prandial glucose, but not fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo (114980).\n\nPanax ginseng has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One clinical study shows that taking a combination of Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, and cheonggukjang, a type of fermented soybean paste, 20 grams daily for 8 weeks can decrease fasting blood glucose levels by 17% in patients with prediabetes (23640). Also, taking fermented Panax ginseng 2.7 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces 2-hour postprandial glucose by about 17% and increases 2-hour postprandial insulin levels by about 44% when compared to baseline; when compared with placebo, these changes are significant (89740). It is unclear if these effects are due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for these conditions.\nInsomnia. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nLiver disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for liver diseases, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for these conditions.\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for male infertility.\nChronic prostatitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with reduced male fertility due to decreased sperm concentration and motility. Preliminary clinical research in adults with this condition shows that taking 25 mL of a specific product containing L-arginine 1660 mg, L-carnitine 150 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 50 mg, and Panax ginseng 200 mg (Fertimev) along with prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 6 months improves sperm concentration and sperm motility when compared to treatment with prulifloxacin alone (59006). It is unclear if this effect is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Research on oral Panax ginseng for menopausal symptoms has yielded conflicting results.\nOne clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking Panax ginseng extract (G115) 200 mg daily orally for 16 weeks does not improve psychological well-being or reduce vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes when compared with placebo (10981). However, several smaller clinical studies in postmenopausal adults demonstrate beneficial effects with higher doses of Panax ginseng. One study shows that taking Panax ginseng 1 gram (containing 30 mg ginsenosides) three times daily for 12 weeks reduces hot flashes and other symptoms, as measured by the Kupperman index and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), when compared with placebo (89749). Another study shows that taking an extract of Korean red ginseng, a specific form of Panax ginseng, 500 mg 4 times daily for 8 weeks improves fatigue severity scores by 21%, compared with 3% in those receiving placebo (106666). In premenopausal adults with menopausal symptoms following surgery for gynecologic cancer, taking Panax ginseng 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks reduces the total symptom score on the MRS when compared with baseline. However, there was also a robust response in the placebo group, with no significant difference in symptom reduction between groups (104596).\n\nPanax ginseng has also been evaluated for improving genitourinary syndrome and cognition after menopause. A small clinical trial in postmenopausal adults with genitourinary syndrome shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng supplement (Ruginseng, Ghaem Daru Pharmaceutical) 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not affect vaginal maturation index or pH, but seems to improve patient-rated symptoms such as vaginal itching and burning, when compared with a lactose placebo (105670). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. In another clinical study, taking a specific combination product (Gincosan) containing Panax ginseng 200 mg and ginkgo 120 mg daily for 6-12 weeks does not improve cognition, memory, mood, anxiety, or sleep when compared with placebo (87767).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of 23 clinical studies in healthy adults, menopausal adults, and adults with a variety of metabolic disorders shows that taking Panax ginseng 200 mg to 8 grams daily for 4 to 24 weeks reduces glucose area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but does not improve other measures of blood glucose, insulin resistance, blood pressure, lipids, or anthropometric measures when compared with placebo (112838). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking Korean red ginseng, a specific form of Panax ginseng, 6 grams daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces systolic blood pressure from baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Additionally, Panax ginseng has no effect on anthropometric measurements, biochemical markers, or other vital signs when compared with placebo (106667).\nless\nNausea and vomiting. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for nausea and vomiting, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for these conditions.\nNeuropathic pain. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax ginseng for neuropathic pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax ginseng for this condition.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking Panax ginseng 2 grams (containing ginsenosides 4.5 mg/gram) daily for 30 days modestly reduces fatigue and plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) when compared with placebo. All patients were also given milk thistle dried extract 450 mg (Legalon, Bukwang Pharmaceutical) daily and asked to exercise daily for at least 30 minutes (105671).\nless\nOral cancer. It is unclear if topical Panax ginseng is beneficial for oral health in patients with oral cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral cancer and poor oral hygiene shows that rinsing with a specific herbal mouthwash (Dr. Dental care liquid, Jangin Pharm Co., Ltd.) containing Panax ginseng 8 mL for 1 minute twice daily for 14 days reduces oral bacterial load and improves oral hygiene and gingival indices when compared with chlorhexidine or saline rinses (114987).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for osteoarthritis of the hand.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with degenerative osteoarthritis of the hand shows that taking oral Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, 1 gram three times daily for 12 weeks improves pain scores at rest, during daily activity, and at work or sport, and also improves disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score when compared with placebo (107747). The validity of this trial is limited due to the lack of objective outcome measures.\nless\nPneumonia. Injectable Panax ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral Panax ginseng has not been evaluated for this use.\nA meta-analysis of 20 small, low-quality randomized and non-randomized studies in older Chinese adults with severe pneumonia shows that administering an injection containing Panax ginseng extract 0.8 mg/mL and aconite extract 0.1 mg/mL in addition to standard treatment leads to improvement in symptoms such as fever, cough, and chest tightness in 77% of patients as compared with 61% of those who received standard treatment alone. This combination injection may also modestly reduce disease severity and the risk of mortality when compared with standard treatment alone. However, these outcomes were not evaluated in all studies, and dosing regimens were heterogenous (110472). Additionally, it is unclear whether these effects are due to Panax ginseng, aconite, or the combination.\nless\nPremature ejaculation. Oral Panax ginseng has primarily been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nApplying a multi-ingredient cream preparation containing Panax ginseng, angelica root, Cistanches deserticola, Zanthoxyl species, torlidis seed, clove flower, asiasari root, cinnamon bark, and toad venom (SS Cream) to the glans penis one hour prior to intercourse and washing off immediately before intercourse seems to improve ejaculatory latency in adults with premature ejaculation when compared with placebo (2537). It is unclear if this effect is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nQuality of life. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for quality of life.\nWhile some research suggests that Panax ginseng might improve self-rated quality of life (6254, 23644), other studies show no benefit (8601, 10314). In studies showing benefit for quality of life, doses have included one capsule daily of a specific Panax ginseng extract (Pharmaton Capsules, Pharmaton Natural Health Products) for 12 weeks (6254) and Panax ginseng extract (G115) 40 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (23644).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for improving symptoms of RA.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with RA, Sjogren syndrome, or both shows that taking Panax ginseng 2000 mg daily for 3 months does not improve fatigue scores when compared with placebo (114984).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial in patients with Sjogren syndrome.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with RA, Sjogren syndrome, or both shows that taking Panax ginseng 2000 mg daily for 3 months does not improve fatigue scores when compared with placebo (114984).\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for stress.\nA small clinical study in healthy patients with occupational stress shows that taking a specific Panax ginseng root preparation (HRG80) high in ginsenosides daily for 14 days modestly reduces perceived stress and improves attention and memory when compared with placebo. However, taking a standard Panax ginseng preparation with a lower quantity of ginsenosides was no better than placebo (103050). However, a moderate-sized clinical study in adult males shows that taking Panax ginseng 2000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve self-reported stress response when compared with placebo (114988).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng prevents stroke.\nA small clinical study in adults with severe atherosclerosis in major intracranial arteries or extracranial carotid arteries at high risk for ischemic stroke shows that taking an extract of Korean red ginseng, a type of Panax ginseng, 1000 mg twice daily for 12 months does not prevent transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke and does not improve neurological disability, cerebral blood flow, or the incidence of new ischemic brain lesions when compared with placebo (112835).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for asthenic syndrome due to TBI.\nA small study in adults with asthenic syndrome secondary to mild combat TBI shows that taking Panax ginseng improves autonomic nervous system functioning and asthenic symptoms when compared to baseline (112834). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group.\nless\nVascular dementia. Oral Panax ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients aged 60 years or older with vascular dementia shows that taking a supplement containing extracts of Panax ginseng, ginkgo, and saffron three times daily for 16 weeks modestly improves some cognitive function scores, caregiver assessed activities of daily living, and patient-reported quality of life when compared with placebo. However, these effects were not maintained after patients stopped taking the supplement (111336). Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if oral Panax ginseng is beneficial for wrinkled skin.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking 3 grams of a combination of Korean red ginseng root with Torilus fructus and Corni fructus daily for 24 weeks may reduce wrinkles when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to affect skin elasticity, moisture, thickness, or color (23645). It is unclear if this benefit is due to Panax ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Panax ginseng for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPanax ginseng is typically used in doses of 200 mg to 3 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Doses of up to 9 grams have been used less often. When used for up to 16 weeks, doses of 2 grams daily have been used. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nPanax ginseng extract is sometimes standardized to ginsenosides. Concentrations of ginsenosides have ranged from 1% to 80% (10314, 23611, 23612, 23646, 54374, 59006, 89712, 89744).\n\nPanax ginseng is thought to have stimulant effects. Theoretically, there may be an additive stimulant effect with the caffeine in foods and drinks, such as coffee and tea (589, 594). Until more is known, avoid taking Panax ginseng with caffeine-containing foods and drinks.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn general, Panax ginseng is standardized to ginsenoside content, but the total content of ginsenosides can vary. Overall, the total ginsenoside content of Panax ginseng root or root extract can range from 1% to 80% (10314, 23611, 23612, 23646, 54374, 59006, 89712, 89744). Extract from the pulp and juice of 4 year-old Panax ginseng berry has been standardized to contain 10% ginsenoside Re (89747). However, the contents of commercial preparations labeled as containing Panax ginseng can vary greatly; many contain little or no Panax ginseng (6, 13).\n\nPanax ginseng is classified into one of three groups according to how processed: fresh, white, or red ginseng. Fresh ginseng is typically harvested when less than 4 years old and is used as-is. White ginseng is typically prepared by peeling and drying fresh ginseng that has been aged 4-6 years. Preparation of white ginseng does not involve steaming. Red ginseng is fresh ginseng that has typically been aged for at least 6 years. Red ginseng is prepared by steaming and drying fresh ginseng without peeling (3122, 23637). There has been interest in using ginseng sprouts due to their shorter cultivation period, potentially higher content of ginsenosides, and more economically efficient production (114983).\n\nPanax ginseng ginsenoside content can be optimized through a variety of physical and chemical transformations. High temperature and pressure increases production of the ginsenosides Rg3, Rg5, Rg6, Rh2, Rh3, Rh4, and Rs3. These ginsenosides are usually absent or present in only small amounts in preparations of white or red ginseng (11006). Hydroponic cultivation of Panax ginseng by vertical-farming technology (FSSCC2 2000 certified standards) is said to increase the ginsenoside content by 2-3 fold (103050). Bioconverted formulations of Panax ginseng converts hydrophilic ginsenosides into hydrophobic ginsenosides Rg3, Rk1, Rg5, F2, and CK, increasing absorption speed, plasma ginsenoside concentration, total exposure, and bioavailability when compared with regular Panax ginseng (112832). Additionally, fermenting Panax ginseng increases peak concentrations, time to peak concentration, and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of ginsenosides compound K, compound O, compound Y, F2, Rh2, protopanaxadiol, and panaxatriol by up to 20-fold when compared with unfermented Panax ginseng (112841). Lastly, taking Panax ginseng with probiotics might increase plasma concentrations of some Panax ginseng ginsenosides (112831).",

However, research is conflicting.\nThere is some evidence that Panax ginseng can inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme by approximately 6% (1303, 51331). In addition, in animal research, Panax ginseng inhibits the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, by a small amount (103478).

One such drug is imatinib. Inhibition of CYP3A4 was believed to be responsible for a case of imatinib-induced hepatotoxicity (89764). In contrast, Panax ginseng has been shown to increase the clearance of midazolam, another drug metabolized by CYP3A4 (89734, 103478). Clinical research shows that Panax ginseng can reduce midazolam area under the curve by 44%, maximum plasma concentration by 26%, and time to reach maximum plasma concentration by 29% (89734).

The patient took imatinib 400 mg along with a Panax ginseng-containing energy drink daily for 3 months. Since imatinib-associated hepatotoxicity typically occurs within 2 years of initiating therapy, it is believed that Panax ginseng affected imatinib toxicity though inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nGinsenosides seem to have a low oral bioavailability in humans and animal models (11153, 17734). In human research, following ingestion of Panax ginseng or ginsenoside Re, the ginsenosides Re, Rb1, and Rb2 were not detectable in blood samples taken over 0.5-6 hours. However, ginsenosides may have been present at concentrations below the lower limit of detection (8 ng/mL) (17734).\n\nIntestinal microflora transforms ginsenosides by deglycosylation, which seems to improve absorption by converting hydrophilic ginsenosides into hydrophobic ginsenosides. For example, ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc are cleaved into ginsenoside compound K, which is better absorbed than its parent ginsenosides. The extent of intestinal deglycosylation of ginsenosides seems to vary significantly between individuals (59840, 89884, 105669, 112831).\n\nHowever, individual variation in ginsenoside absorption can be bypassed to increase ginsenoside absorption and enhance pharmacokinetic properties. Bioconverted formulations of Panax ginseng convert hydrophilic ginsenosides into hydrophobic ginsenosides Rg3, Rk1, Rg5, F2, and CK, increasing maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), bioavailability, and absorption and reducing time to peak concentration (Tmax) when compared with regular Panax ginseng formulations (112832). Fermenting Panax ginseng has similar pharmacokinetic effects on ginsenosides compound K, compound O, compound Y, F2, Rh2, protopanaxadiol, and panaxatriol when compared with unfermented Panax ginseng. Fermentation led to a 20-fold increase in peak concentrations of compound K and Rh-2 when compared with unfermented Panax ginseng. Additionally, ginsenosides CY and F2 that were below quantifiable levels in unfermented Panax ginseng were detected after fermentation (112841).\n\nIn humans, after oral administration of ginsenoside Rb1 and ginseng extracts, the time to maximum concentration of ginsenoside compound K occurs at about 10-11 hours, with a maximum concentration of about 1.7-28 ng/mL (89884, 105669).\nExcretion\nIn humans, consuming a single oral dose of Panax ginseng extract 2.95 grams results in a ginsenoside compound K half-life of about 10.2 hours. Consuming a single dose of ginsenoside compound K 600 mg results in a half-life of about 8.7 hours (105669).\n\nIn rats, the distribution and elimination of Rg1 and Re were rapid after intravenous infusion, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics indicate a two-compartment model (11153). In rats, orally administered ginsenosides were mainly eliminated by first-pass biliary excretion (59840).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Panax ginseng is the root. Panax ginseng contains several active constituents. The constituents thought to be of most importance are triterpenoid saponins, which are referred to collectively as ginsenosides or panaxosides. Numerous subtypes of ginsenosides have been identified from Panax ginseng and are structurally classified as protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol, or oleanane depending on the position of their sugar molecules (89788, 89789, 89790, 89791, 89792, 89793, 89794, 103478, 112832). Panax ginseng also contains the peptidoglycans, panaxans (12536) and water insoluble polyacetylenic constituents such as panaxynol, panaxydol, and panaxytriol (11005, 89773). Other constituents include pectin, flavonoids, proteins, amino acids, alkaloids, fatty acids, saccharides, phytosterols, vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, B12), and minerals (manganese, copper, vanadium, cobalt, phosphorus, aluminum, nickel) (11, 104955).\nAlcohol clearance effects\nIn healthy males, Panax ginseng extract reduces hangover symptoms (89742). This is possibly due to improved alcohol clearance. Panax ginseng increases alcohol clearance in humans by 30% to 50%, likely by enhancing the metabolic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (12191).\nAnti-aging effects\nIn human research, Panax ginseng increases the copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) when compared with placebo. A reduction in mtDNA copy number is considered a marker of biological aging (106666).\nAnti-arthritis effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that a red ginseng saponin extract containing ginsenosides Rg3, Rk1, and Rg5 reduces symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis, including swelling and joint space narrowing. It is proposed that Panax ginseng attenuates arthritis by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3, an enzyme that appears to correlate with arthritis progression, and reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta (89796).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nThere is evidence that ginsenosides can relax human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro by stimulating the release of nitrous oxide from airway epithelium, which may account for the potential anti-asthmatic effect of Panax ginseng (11007). Also, ginsan, a polysaccharide derived from Panax ginseng, has been shown to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal asthmatic model, possibly by reducing levels of some inflammatory cytokines and increasing levels of prostaglandin E2 (89767).\nAnti-cancer effects\nPanax ginseng might have antitumor activity (3122). In human research, the potential anti-cancer effects of Panax ginseng have been shown in epidemiological (2063, 3122) and preliminary clinical (23619, 23620) research. Antineoplastic effects of ginseng have also been found in laboratory research; cell proliferation is inhibited in vitro and tumor size is reduced in animal models (89771, 89772, 89799, 89800). The nature of this mechanism is poorly understood, but ginsenosides Rg3, Rg5, and Rh2 are active components that may prevent cancer, either singularly or synergistically (89797). Extracts of Panax ginseng decrease the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), diminish DNA strand breakage, and inhibit the formation of induced skin tumors in laboratory models (11006). There is conflicting research about the antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity of Panax ginseng; however, this may also play a role in its anti-cancer effects (4227, 8602). Ginsenosides have been shown to inhibit tumor cell invasion and suppress sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes (11006). The Panax ginseng constituent panaxydol seems to inhibit the proliferation of various types of cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell growth at the cell cycle G1 to S transition phase (11005). Also, intestinal metabolites of Panax ginseng constituents may interfere with tumor cell processes (89809, 89811, 89812, 89813). In general, the anti-cancer effects of Panax ginseng and its constituents may be due to immunomodulating effects (89798), phase 2 enzyme induction (89808), inhibition of intra-cellular pathways involved in cancer progression (89802, 89803, 89804, 89805, 89806, 89810), and stimulation of pathways involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis (89774, 89775, 89801, 89804, 89807).\nAnti-fatigue effects\nIn human research, the anti-fatigue effects of Panax ginseng are thought to be at least partially related to its antioxidant effects. Panax ginseng decreases serum reactive oxygen species and measurements of oxidation, and increases antioxidant status, although activities of antioxidant enzymes are not affected (89743). The antioxidant effects of Panax ginseng also played a role in anti-fatigue effects of Panax ginseng in an animal model (689). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in adults shows that taking red ginseng capsules 1400 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases blood lactic acid and creatine phosphokinase levels after inducing exercise fatigue when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on cortisol level. Researchers theorize that the reduction of creatine phosphokinase delays physical fatigue while the reduction in lactate prevents peripheral fatigue and the accumulation of tissue-damaging free radicals (112842).\nAnti-fungal effects\nPanaxagin, a protein isolated from unprocessed Panax ginseng root, seems to have antifungal activity, according to preliminary research. It appears to inhibit ribosomal activity of some fungi (8603).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPanax ginseng has been shown to reduce muscle injury and inflammation following exercise in laboratory (89770) and human (89738) research. The anti-inflammatory effects of Panax ginseng are likely related to the inhibitory effects of ginsenosides on inflammatory cytokines (89782, 89817), inducible nitric oxide synthase (89817), and inflammatory eicosanoids (89817). However, a clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking Panax ginseng does not improve serum biomarkers associated with inflammation including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 (112839, 114983).\nAnti-platelet effects\nGinsenosides and other Panax ginseng constituents, such as panaxynol, seem to interfere with platelet activation, aggregation, and coagulation in vitro (1522, 89736, 89821, 89822). Also, non-saponin constituents of Panax ginseng inhibit the response of platelets to thrombin as well as platelet activation (1522, 89758).\nAnti-stress effects\nGinseng is widely used as a general tonic or \"adaptogen\" for fighting stress. There is some evidence that it might work against stress by affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Panax ginseng saponins seem to increase serum cortisol concentrations in animal models (3256, 3257). Other clinical research in patients with increased stress shows that taking Panax ginseng daily for 2 months attenuates the decreases in serotonin and increases in cortisol occurring during stress when compared with placebo (114988).\nAnti-viral effects\nA few studies indicate that ginseng may have antiviral activity in both humans and animals. Clinical research suggests that taking Panax ginseng reduces the frequency of developing an acute respiratory illness, such as the common cold or influenza (589, 89746). Panaxagin, a protein isolated from unprocessed ginseng root, seems to have antiviral activity, according to preliminary research; it appears to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase (8603). Also, Panax ginseng induces deletions in the HIV virus, coinciding with an increase in CD4 T cell counts and CD4:CD8 ratios (89826, 89827). The anti-rotavirus effects of Panax ginseng appear to be due to pectic polysaccharide constituents, which may inhibit binding of the virus to cells (89825).\nAntibacterial effects\nSome people try ginseng for cystic fibrosis because there is preliminary evidence that it has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. However, this effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans (3095, 3096).\n\nIn animal research, mice treated with ginsan, a polysaccharide derived from Panax ginseng, prior to a bacterial challenge of Staphylococcus aureus were protected from sepsis. This protective effect may be due to early suppression of acute inflammatory responses and later enhancement of macrophage activity (89768).\nAntidepressant effects\nPanax ginseng is traditionally used for depression and anxiety. In laboratory research, Panax ginseng constituents have been shown to reduce depression and increase social interactions (89848, 89849). A reduction in brain oxidative stress and downregulation of serum corticosterone levels may play a role (89849).\nAntidiabetes effects\nAnimal research suggests that long-term Panax ginseng berry extract use with metformin might increase metformin concentrations in the liver without altering other pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing efficacy without increasing the incidence of adverse effects. When taken with metformin, Panax ginseng berry extract upregulates mRNA expression of organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1), which increases metformin uptake from the blood to hepatocytes. There is also reduced mRNA expression of multidrug and toxin extrusion-1 (MATE1), which inhibits the efflux of metformin into bile and therefore reduces biliary excretion of metformin. Higher hepatic metformin concentrations are associated with enhanced inhibition of gluconeogenesis, increasing metformin's efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes.\n\nAdditionally, Panax ginseng berry extract did not change kidney mRNA levels of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2-K, which are all implicated in the metformin's primary elimination pathway, renal excretion. The lack of effect on the kidneys suggests minimal toxic effects, namely lactic acidosis and fluid retention (112836).\nAntiemetic effects\nPanax ginseng is commonly used for gastritis and vomiting. Animal research suggests that Panax ginseng extract has antiemetic effects (89753, 89815). The mechanism of action may be related to the constituent panaxatriol. In vitro, this constituent inhibits the recombinant serotonin type 3A receptor, which is believed to mediate nausea and vomiting (89751).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of Panax ginseng constituents are thought to play a role in its various clinical effects, including its anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its ability to improve symptoms of fatigue and increase performance. Panax ginseng has antioxidant activity in human research (4227, 89754, 106666). This is thought to be due to ginsenoside content, which has the ability to activate antioxidant enzymes (89779, 89820) and scavenge or suppress free radicals (89780, 89818, 89819).\nAntiulcer effects\nGinseng is widely used as a general tonic or \"adaptogen\" for fighting stress. There is some evidence that it might work against stress by affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Panax ginseng saponins seem to increase serum cortisol concentrations in animal models (3256, 3257). Other clinical research in patients with increased stress shows that taking Panax ginseng daily for 2 months attenuates the decreases in serotonin and increases in cortisol occurring during stress when compared with placebo (114988).\nAuditory effects\nIn individuals exposed to continuous noise, preliminary clinical research suggests that taking Panax ginseng improves the hearing threshold at most frequencies tested (89739). In an animal model, Panax ginseng and compound K reduced threshold shifts, central auditory function damage, and cochlear functional and morphological deficits in noise-induced hearing loss in mice (89828). Although a mechanism is unclear, Panax ginseng may increase cell viability of auditory cells in an ototoxicity model, possibly by attenuation of increases in reactive oxygen species and resulting prevention of apoptosis (89776).\nBlood pressure effects\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of Panax ginseng on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. It appears that, although taking Panax ginseng 4.5 grams may moderately decrease systolic blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (23632), taking Ginseol K-g1 does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with prehypertension or stage I hypertension (89741). It is possible that these discrepant results are related to the types of ginsenosides in the products. The ginsenosides have a wide range of pharmacological activity and effects. In some cases, these isolated constituents seem to counteract each other's activity. For example, ginsenoside Rg1 raises blood pressure and ginsenoside Rb1 lowers blood pressure. In animal models ginsenosides had biphasic actions on vascular response and blood pressure (11, 89763). Some of the blood pressure effects may be due to a relaxing effect on smooth muscle induced by certain ginsenosides (89763, 89778, 89829). Also, in vitro, Panax ginseng extract inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, although nitric oxide (NO) production was not affected (89766).\nCardiovascular protective effects\nIn some human research, Panax ginseng appears to have negligible effects on cardiovascular function (4322). However, an intravenous formulation of ginseng seems to increase ejection fraction in patients with congestive heart failure. Ginseng might improve hemodynamics and might work synergistically with digoxin (4243, 8604). Orally, ginseng improves coronary flow reserve in patients following myocardial infarction, possibly by increasing the number of angiogenic cells (89835). In healthy humans, Panax ginseng improves arterial stiffness (89882).\n\nCardioprotective effects have also been shown in laboratory research. In animal models, Panax ginseng reduced the susceptibility to arrhythmias (89833), improved heart function (89755, 89834), and decreased infarction size (71225). Some of these benefits may be due to a relaxing effect on smooth muscle induced by certain ginsenosides (89763, 89778, 89829). Also, various constituents of ginseng have been shown to prevent the development of atherosclerosis through inhibition of signaling pathways in various cells, such as endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, cardiomyocytes, and dendritic cells (89830, 89831, 89832, 89837, 89883).\n\nSome ginsenosides have structural similarities to cardiac glycosides and can interfere with measurement of serum digoxin levels by some assay methods (15585, 15587). However, it is not clear whether Panax ginseng has any of the pharmacological effects of cardiac glycosides.\nCentral nervous system effects\nIn human research, the anti-fatigue effects of Panax ginseng are thought to be at least partially related to its central nervous system effects. However, in some cases, ginsenosides seem to counteract each other's activity. For example, ginsenoside Rg1 acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and ginsenoside Rb1 acts as a CNS depressant (11). CNS-stimulating effects of Panax ginseng have been found in animal models (89839).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nThere is some evidence that a Panax ginseng root extract can mildly inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity by approximately 6% in humans. However, contradictory research suggests Panax ginseng might not significantly inhibit CYP2D6. Panax ginseng appears to have no effect on CYP1A2 activity (1303, 10847).\nDermatologic effects\nPanax ginseng is part of an oral formulation used to reduce skin wrinkling in aging individuals (23645). It is also traditionally used for wound healing. Laboratory research suggests that effects on skin may be due to accelerated fibronectin synthesis in skin fibroblasts and in skin (89851, 89852), as well inhibited collagen degradation (89878) and increased ceramide levels (89879). Anti-inflammatory effects in skin lesions of animal models have also been shown (89880, 89881).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAn observational study in healthy postmenopausal adults aged 50 years and older in Korea shows that taking red ginseng fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum and L. brevis 20 mL before meals for 3 weeks normalizes stool consistency and increases the frequency of bowel movements. Fermented red ginseng is also associated with changes in 20 bacterial species which correlate with 16 metabolic pathways. Researchers theorize that the probiotics provided by the fermentation process or probiotics taken in addition to Panax ginseng facilitate the growth of certain bacterial species that enhance ginsenoside absorption through deglycosylation metabolism in the intestines (112831, 112837).\nHepatoprotective effects\nGinseng may be beneficial for liver health. In humans, taking Panax ginseng improves levels of some liver enzymes in patients with elevated levels (103477). In addition, both Panax ginseng and its constituents have demonstrated protective effects against hepatic injuries in animal models (89853) possibly via antioxidant activity (89784, 89785) and/or inhibition of inflammatory mediators (89785).\nHypoglycemic effects\nPanax ginseng may affect blood glucose. The effect of Panax ginseng on blood glucose may vary with batches, plant parts, and preparation methods (12536). Panax ginseng might reduce or increase fasting blood glucose concentrations and test results (12536, 23626, 23629, 89740). However, other research shows that Panax ginseng has no effect on blood glucose (23628). In human research, Korean red ginseng root lowers post-prandial blood glucose in healthy individuals with normal glucose levels; however, the rootlets with higher ginsenosides levels do not (89732). Also, preliminary evidence suggests that Panax ginseng might reduce tissue insulin resistance and changes in gene expression in type II diabetes (8605).\n\nThe effect of ginseng on glucose appears to be related in part to the mix of ginsenosides. Other non-ginsenoside constituents likely affect blood glucose as well. Panax ginseng and other ginsengs contain protopanaxadiol (PPD) ginsenosides, Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd. They also contain protopanaxatriol (PPT) ginsenosides, Rg1, Re, and Rf. A higher ratio of PPD ginsenosides to PPT ginsenosides is related to greater blood glucose and insulin lowering potency of the ginseng product. Compared with American ginseng, Panax ginseng appears to have a lower PPD to PPT ratio and may have less blood glucose. Some research suggests Panax ginseng may actually increase postprandial blood glucose and lower preprandial insulin levels. However, ginsenoside content varies among batches, plant parts, and preparation methods (12536). Panax ginseng contains the peptidoglycans, panaxans, which have hypoglycemic effects in human research (12536). The malonyl-ginsenosides, found in Panax ginseng roots, also reduce blood glucose levels in an animal diabetic model (89814).\nImmune effects\nPanax ginseng might affect immune function. Both suppression and enhancement of humoral and cellular immunity have been reported in laboratory research due to ginseng extracts; discrepancy may arise from the difference in dose levels, composition, and duration of therapy (89855, 89856, 89857). Panax ginseng appears to stimulate natural-killer cell activity and possibly other immune-system activity. In animal research, ginseng has been shown to enhance cellular immune function by stimulating natural killer cell activity (10725, 89857, 89858) and increasing antibody production (89857). Panax ginseng has also been shown to stimulate the activity of macrophages in laboratory research (89859, 89863), as well as lymphocytes in general in elderly humans (89861) and laboratory research (89862, 89863). In healthy adults, taking Panax ginseng 2 grams daily for 8 weeks increases T-cell, B-cell, and white blood cell counts when compared with placebo (104955).\n\nMechanisms of action likely relate to stimulation of inflammatory mediators (89859, 89860, 89863, 89865) and production of nitric oxide (89859). The panaxanes have been implicated in some of the immunomodulatory effects of Panax ginseng (89863). The ginsenosides also play a role; however, different ginsenosides may modulate lymphocyte proliferation in a different manner (89864). Also, there is evidence to suggest that some of the ginsenosides, especially Rh1, may inhibit immune function and inflammatory mediator activity resulting in anti-allergic effects (89769, 89795).\nLipid effects\nGinseng might lower lipid levels, but research is conflicting. In some human (12538, 89759, 102238, 114981) and animal (89759, 89867) research, Panax ginseng lowered serum cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels, possibly by increasing lipoprotein lipase activity, which enhances lipid metabolism (12538). However, other clinical research in humans shows that Panax ginseng red or black extracts do not change total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with placebo (112839). The conflicting results may be due to the differential effects of various ginsenosides. For example, ginsenoside Re has been shown to reduce cholesterol while Rb1 has been shown to increase it in laboratory research (89866).\nMemory effects\nSome clinical evidence shows that taking Panax ginseng orally can improve abstract thinking, attention, mental arithmetic skills, and reaction times in healthy, middle-aged people; however, Panax ginseng does not seem to improve these outcomes in young adults (2064, 23596, 23599, 23608, 23609, 54374). While Panax ginseng alone does not seem to improve memory (2064), there is some evidence that a combination of Panax ginseng and ginkgo leaf extract can improve memory in otherwise healthy people or people with neurasthenia ages 38 to 66 years (8591, 9759, 87984, 88046). In healthy individuals, Panax ginseng can directly modulate cerebroelectrical activity (89838).\n\nThe mechanism of action of Panax ginseng is likely related to its ginsenoside constituents. The ginsenoside Rb1 has been suggested to exert its memory effects by minimizing the inhibitory effects of beta-amyloid peptides, which are thought to play a role in memory degeneration (89840). However, neither Rb1 nor Rg1 reversed beta-amyloid-induced cell death (89841). Ginsenoside administration has also been shown to prevent memory impairment in various animal models (89842, 89843, 89844, 89847), possibly by up-regulating plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus (89842) or by reducing inflammatory signaling (89844). In one memory model, the ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 both improved memory; however, the mechanisms of action were considered to be different. Although both ginsenosides increased hippocampus levels of acetylcholine, only Rg1 inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity. Rb1 had a greater effect on maintaining serotonin levels (89846). Other authors suggest the glycemic properties of Panax ginseng may play a role in its cognitive enhancement (23608, 23609).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn human research, Panax ginseng root can improve cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease (23611, 23612) and in older adults with subjective memory impairment (114983). The neuroprotective effects of Panax ginseng may play a role in the improved performance in these patients. In laboratory research, ginsenosides have been shown to potentiate nerve growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor (11, 89870) and might confer neuroprotection through nicotinic activity (3109). Ginsenosides have also been shown to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation (89868). Ginsenosides may also protect against apoptosis of nerve cells (89869, 89871) and inflammatory processes in microglial cells (89783). Clinical research shows that taking Panax ginseng sprout extract daily for 3 months decreases acetylcholinesterase levels in the blood (114983).\nRespiratory effects\nPanax ginseng is traditionally used for asthma. In human research, bronchodilation occurred in most healthy individuals tested (23599). In laboratory research, ginsenosides have been shown to induce a nitric oxide-mediated relaxation effect in bronchial smooth muscle (11007) and pulmonary endothelium (89778). This offers a possible mechanism for the above clinical effects of Panax ginseng. The constituent ginsan, has been shown to reduce fibrosis of pulmonary lung fibroblasts in vitro, possibly by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine activity (89872).\nSexual effects\nPanax ginseng is commonly used to increase fertility and sexual arousal in both males and females. A multi-ingredient cream preparation containing Panax ginseng is thought to work in patients with premature ejaculation by increasing the penile vibratory threshold and reducing the amplitude of penile somatosensory evoked potentials (2537). Also, ginsenosides improved libido and erection ability in human research (89761). Panax ginseng has been shown to increase sperm counts in animals (89876, 89877) and humans (89786). The constituent ginsenosides may have effects that enhance sexual function. Ginsenosides have been shown to enhance release of nitric oxide from rabbit corpus cavernosum in vitro (89873) and cause smooth muscle relaxation (89874). They have also been shown to increase copulatory behavior in animal research (89875).\n\nThe hormonal effects of Panax ginseng are controversial. Some clinical evidence suggests it doesn't have estrogen-mediated effects such as increasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol levels, or endometrial thickness (10981). However, case reports of ginseng side effects such as postmenopausal vaginal bleeding suggest estrogen activity (590, 591, 592, 10982, 10983). Panax ginseng extract has been shown to increase serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity (a measure of estrogenic activity in the liver) in animal models when ovaries are removed (6180). In vitro research also shows estrogen activity. Studies on human breast cancer cells indicate that ginseng, specifically its constituent ginsonside-Rb1, acts as a phytoestrogen, possibly by binding and activating the estrogen receptor (10984, 12537, 89756). Panax ginseng may also affect levels of other hormones. In females, Panax ginseng increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels (3863). In both animal and human research, Panax ginseng increased levels of testosterone in the blood (89786, 89787). Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone may be increased in males (89786).\nUlcer protective effects\nIn peptic ulceration, Panax ginseng has shown inhibitory activity on Helicobacter pylori-induced hemagglutination in vitro (3121). In animal research, samgyetang, a soup made from chicken, Panax ginseng, garlic, jujube, and chestnuts, appears to offer protection from experimentally induced peptic ulcers (10249).\nWeight loss effects\nPanax ginseng is sometimes added to supplements intended for use in weight loss. Animal research in obese rats eating a high fat diet shows that receiving intraperitoneal injections of Panax ginseng constituents (ginsenosides Rb1, Rd, and Rg1) reduces body mass and weight when compared with no treatment. Theoretically, ginsenosides increase satiety by modulating hormones and neurotransmitters such as leptin and neuropeptide Y (102239)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Panax notoginseng is a perennial plant that grows in the mountains in Yunnan province in Southwest China (94323, 94324, 94378). The root, which is harvested after 3-5 years of growth, is most commonly used medicinally (94324). The fruits, flower, and leaves of Panax notoginseng plants that have grown for at least 3 years are also used (94378).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Panax notoginseng has been used with apparent safety in doses of 100-400 mg 1-3 times daily for up to 6 weeks (17183, 94321, 94326, 94378, 94384, 109674). ...when given as an injection, under medical supervision. Panax notoginseng extract has been used with apparent safety in doses of 400-800 mg daily for up to 10 weeks (94324, 94326, 94373, 98976, 109523).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Panax notoginseng when administered rectally.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally (5559). Ginsenoside Rb1, an active constituent of Panax notoginseng, has teratogenic effects in animal models (10447).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nPanax notoginseng seems to be generally well tolerated when used orally or intravenously.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dry mouth, flushed skin, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting.\n\nIntravenously: Headache, itching, rash.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nIntravenously: Fever, pustular drug eruption.\nDermatologic\nOrally, Panax notoginseng can cause flushed skin (5558). When given orally or intravenously, rash has been reported (94321, 94324, 94326, 94378, 98976). There is a case of interstitial granulomatous drug reaction in a 73-year-old male who had been using oral Panax notoginseng extract for 2 months. The condition repeated after 5 days of intravenous use at a later time. The skin condition gradually cleared after use of the product was discontinued (94316). In a retrospective review of hospital records of 30,884 patients, a specific Xueshuantong injection (XSTI) containing Panax notoginseng saponins was associated with a 4% incidence of skin reactions, including redness, itching, and maculopapules (98976).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally and intravenously, Panax notoginseng can cause dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting (5558, 94321, 98976). In one case report, a patient developed a large submucosal hematoma extending from the hypopharynx to lower esophagus after taking one oral dose of an unknown quantity of Panax notoginseng and hirudin (109671). It is unclear if this event was due to Panax notoginseng, hirudin, or other factors.\nless\nImmunologic\nIntravenously, Panax notoginseng saponins have been associated with five cases of pustular drug eruption due to acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. The skin eruption was associated with fever and an increased neutrophil count in some cases. Symptoms were deemed to be probably or likely due to the Panax notoginseng product (94327). In a retrospective review of hospital records of 30,884 patients, a specific Xueshuantong injection (XSTI) containing Panax notoginseng saponins was associated with a fever frequency of 0.2%, edema frequency of 0.1%, and anaphylactic reactions in 0.03% (98976).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, Panax notoginseng can cause nervousness and insomnia (5558). Intravenously, Panax notoginseng has been reported to cause headache (94326, 94378). In a retrospective review of hospital records of 30,884 patients, a specific Xueshuantong injection (XSTI) containing Panax notoginseng saponins was associated with a headache frequency of 0.3% and paresthesia frequency of 0.1% (98976).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAngina. Low-quality clinical research shows that oral or intravenous Panax notoginseng may improve the frequency and severity of angina symptoms.\nMeta-analyses of low-quality clinical research in patients with angina shows that Panax notoginseng administered intravenously or orally 200-400 mg 2-3 times daily for 2-6 weeks, in addition to conventional medicine, increases the number of patients who achieve a 50% improvement in angina pectoris symptoms by approximately 1.2-fold when compared with conventional medicine alone (94321, 94326, 94378). Panax notoginseng also reduces angina attack frequency by about 2 attacks per week but does not reduce the incidence of intractable angina pectoris (94321).\nless\nIntracranial hemorrhage. Low-quality clinical research shows that intravenous Panax notoginseng saponins may improve recovery and mortality in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in patients with intracranial or intracerebral hemorrhage shows that treatment with Panax notoginseng saponins 140-600 mg intravenously daily for 2-10 weeks increases the odds of improvement by 2.7-fold when compared with conventional treatment alone. A subgroup analysis also suggests that treatment within 48 hours reduces the risk of mortality by 55% when compared with conventional treatment alone (94324).\nless\nStroke. Low-quality clinical research in patients with ischemic stroke shows that oral or intravenous Panax notoginseng may improve recovery as well as neurologic and functional scores.\nThree meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with ischemic stroke show that treatment with oral or injectable Panax notoginseng 150-1080 mg daily for 3 days to 6 months with or without standard treatment improves neurological status and increases the overall response rate and improvement rate by around 20% when compared with conventional medicine alone or control (94373, 109523, 112463). Treatment with Panax notoginseng also improved some measures of activities of daily living (109523, 112463). Additionally, preliminary clinical research in patients with a recent anterior cerebral ischemic stroke shows that taking Panax notoginseng root (sanchitongtshu) extract, containing 100 mg of panaxatriol saponins, orally three times daily with aspirin 50 mg daily for 28 days improves neurological deficit scores and activities of daily living scores when compared with placebo and aspirin (17183).\n\nThere is evidence that Panax notoginseng may benefit stroke sequalae beyond the acute period of symptoms. A very large clinical study in adults with mild to moderate ischemic stroke shows that taking Panax notoginseng saponins 60 mg twice daily for 3 months within 14 days of stroke symptom onset in addition to standard care increases the proportion of patients with functional independence at 3 months by 7%, the number of patients with no or minimal disability at 3 months and 12 months by 5% and 3%, respectively, and leads to greater improvements in neurological deficits and activities of daily living when compared with placebo. However, Panax notoginseng does not improve functional independence at 12 months or reduce the risk of recurrent stroke or composite cerebrovascular events when compared with placebo (112464).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Low-quality clinical research shows that oral Panax notoginseng may not reduce the risk of MI in patients with coronary heart disease.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in patients with existing coronary heart disease shows that that taking a specific Panax notoginseng product (Xuesaitong soft capsule, Shenghuo Pharmaceutical Holdings) 240 mg orally twice daily along with conventional therapy for 4 weeks does not reduce the risk of MI when compared with conventional therapy alone (94321).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax notoginseng for atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax notoginseng for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral Panax notoginseng is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in generally healthy adults shows that taking Panax notoginseng 200-1350 mg or ginsenoside Rg1, a constituent of Panax notoginseng, 5 mg orally once daily for 1-30 days before running or cycling increases exercise endurance when compared with control (109672). One clinical study of untrained adults shows that taking Panax notoginseng root powder 1350 mg daily for 30 days increases cycling endurance by at least 7 minutes when compared with baseline (94384). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBleeding. Although there has been interest in using oral Panax notoginseng for bleeding, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax notoginseng for this purpose.\nBruises. Although there has been interest in using topical Panax notoginseng for bruises, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax notoginseng for this purpose.\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral Panax notoginseng is beneficial for improving platelet aggregation and coagulation in patients with CHD.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with CHD and ischemic stroke shows that taking Panax notoginseng preparations including Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) or panaxatriol saponins (PTS) with aspirin reduces platelet aggregation rate when compared with aspirin alone. Subgroup analysis suggests that the two formulations differ in their effect on biomarkers of platelet aggregation and coagulation. PTS increases prothrombin time and prothrombin time-based international normalized ratio (PT-INR) compared with aspirin alone. Meanwhile, PNS reduces fibrinogen and D-dimer compared with aspirin alone. Neither Panax notoginseng preparation changed platelet counts when compared with aspirin alone (112462).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral Panax notoginseng is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nPreliminary clinical research in well-trained males shows that taking Panax notoginseng, 4 grams orally one hour before a downhill run, then every 4 waking hours for 48 hours, and then twice daily for 48 hours, modestly reduces delayed onset muscle soreness at 96 hours, but not at earlier time points, when compared with baseline (94320).

Although there has been interest in using oral Panax notoginseng for NASH, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax notoginseng for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. Oral Panax notoginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking two capsules, each containing 400 mg of a combination of Panax notoginseng, Siberian ginseng, and rehmannia, orally daily for 6 weeks moderately improves physical function scores, but not pain or stiffness scores, when compared with placebo (74950). It is unclear if these effects are due to Panax notoginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral Panax notoginseng for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Panax notoginseng for this purpose.\nUlcerative colitis. Rectal Panax notoginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults admitted to the hospital with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis lesions shows that administering a 1-gram suppository containing Panax notoginseng and multiple other ingredients rectally for 3 months improves diarrhea and bloody stool symptom scores when compared with a 0.8-gram suppository containing the same ingredients. Recurrence at 12 months occurred in approximately 10% of the patients who received the higher-dose combination product compared with 47% of patients who received the lower dose. Patients in each group received 2 suppositories twice daily for the first month, 1 suppository twice daily for the second month, and 1 suppository once daily for the third month. Each suppository contained Panax notoginseng 36 grams, cortex phellodendri 120 grams, radix Sanguisorbae 120 grams, arnebia root, 120 grams, radix pulsatillae 120 grams, rhizoma coptidis 120 grams, cortex fraxini 120 grams, rhizoma corydalis, pericarpium papaveris 72 grams, radix sophorae flavescentis 72 grams, and rhizoma bletillae 72 grams (109673). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of comparison to placebo or active control with known effectiveness for ulcerative colitis. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to Panax notoginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral or intravenous Panax notoginseng is beneficial for the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing surgical treatment for a fracture shows that using a Panax notoginseng injection, alone or in combination with other anticoagulants, for 3-14 days reduces the risk of DVT by 58% when compared with active control, such as low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or rivaroxaban (105510). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies. A prospective study in post-surgical adults using LMWH shows that taking a specific Panax notoginseng tablet (Xuesaitong, Hunan Xiangya Pharmaceutical Company) 100 mg three times daily reduces the risk of DVT by 44% when compared with LMWH alone (109674). The validity of this study is limited by lack of randomization.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Panax notoginseng for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe ginsenoside Rb1 has a low oral bioavailability from Panax notoginseng in animal research (11153, 94324).\nDistribution\nWhen given intravenously, the notoginsenoside derivative panaxatrol disuccinate sodium declined rapidly in the plasma and had a broad distribution (94325).\nMetabolism\nClinical research suggests that parent ginsenosides from Panax notoginseng are deglycosylated into active metabolites by enzymes secreted from the gut microbiota. These metabolites include ginsenoside F1, protopanaxatriol, ginsenoside Rh2, ginsenoside compound K and protopanaxadiol (98975).\nExcretion\nThe ginsenoside Rg1 is rapidly eliminated from the blood in animal models (11153). The elimination rate of ginsenosides varies. Ginsenoside Rb1 has a slower clearance (94324).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Panax notoginseng are the root, flowers, fruits, and leaves. The root is most commonly used medicinally (94323). Panax notoginseng root contains 12% saponins; the most important are triterpenoid saponins, which are referred to collectively as ginsenosides or panaxosides (94323). Ginsenosides is the term developed by Asian researchers, and the term panaxosides was developed by Russian researchers. Numerous subtypes of ginsenosides have been identified. Panax notoginseng contains notoginsenosides R1 and R2, as well as the ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1, and lesser amounts of Rd and Re (11153, 12536, 94323, 94325). The individual ginsenosides have been reported to have opposing effects (14802). Processing of the root, by steaming or baking, can alter levels of the individual saponins (4378). The saponins are found throughout the plant. However, different types of saponins are enriched in different parts of the plant (94323).\n\nAlthough the saponins are thought to be the most important constituents for medicinal purposes, other constituents include flavonoids, cyclodipeptides, sterols, polyacetylenes, and volatile constituents such as terpenes (94323).\nAngiogenic effects\nThe individual ginsenosides have been reported to have opposing effects on angiogenesis in vitro. For example Rg1 has been reported to stimulate angiogenesis, while Rb1 seems to inhibit angiogenesis (14802).\nAnti-cancer effects\nAlthough this has not been shown in humans, Panax notoginseng and some saponin constituents have shown anti-cancer effects in laboratory models. Panax notoginseng seems to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells and induce apoptosis (94323).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPanax notoginseng is traditionally used for inflammatory conditions such as muscle soreness, rheumatoid arthritis, and swelling. Laboratory research suggests that Panax notoginseng contains constituents that can inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. The anti-inflammatory effects of Panax notoginseng might also result in the protection of various organs and tissues in the body, including the nervous system, the kidneys, and the liver (94323).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome research in non-diabetic humans suggests that unlike some other ginsengs, Panax notoginseng doesn't affect postprandial blood glucose levels (12536, 94318). However, other research suggests that taking Panax notoginseng daily for 3 days reduces postprandial glucose levels by approximately 20%, especially 30 minutes into an oral glucose tolerance test (94318). It is possible that the dosing schedule plays a role in these differences. Taking Panax notoginseng for a few days prior to testing, as well as just before testing, may be needed to see measurable effects on blood glucose levels during an oral glucose test (94318). Animal research suggests that Panax notoginseng saponins can improve blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity (94323).\nAntifungal effects\nPananotin, a protein isolated from Panax notoginseng root, seems to have antifungal activity, according to preliminary research in vitro (11485).\nAntiviral effects\nPananotin, a protein isolated from Panax notoginseng root, seems to have antiviral activity, according to preliminary research. It appears to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase in vitro (11485, 11486).\nBlood vessel effects\nPanax notoginseng is believed to dilate the coronary vessels, reduce vascular resistance, and improve the coronary collateral circulation. This could increase blood flow while reducing blood pressure. It could also reduce the heart metabolic rate and oxygen consumption (5558, 94323).\nCardiovascular effects\nPanax notoginseng has been shown to have cardiovascular benefits in laboratory and in vitro models. Panax notoginseng protects myocardial cells, possibly by reducing oxidative stress or pro-inflammation cellular signaling as shown with Panax notoginseng extract and some constituents (6289, 94323). Evidence suggests Panax notoginseng also has an antiarrhythmic effect (5558). Evidence from animal research suggests that Panax notoginseng might reduce atherosclerosis. This is likely due to its lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory properties (11487, 94323). Certain constituents of Panax notoginseng, including ginsenoside Rg1, have been associated with coagulation effects, including antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity (11487, 17183, 94323, 96220). Thus, some Panax notoginseng constituents might be helpful to protect against cardiovascular diseases.\nCoagulation effects\nThere is interest in using Panax notoginseng for antithrombotic and antiplatelet effects. However, some ginsenosides have been shown to promote platelet aggregation. In contrast, a concentrated Panax notoginseng extract called sanchitongtshu, containing 80% saponins, primarily ginsenoside Rg1, inhibits platelet aggregation, decreases blood viscosity, increases fibrinolysis, and promotes vascular endothelial nitric oxide release (17183, 94323). A meta-analysis of clinical research in humans also shows that using Panax notoginseng injection for 3-14 days reduces D-dimer levels and increases prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin clotting time. However, the validity of these findings is limited by high heterogeneity (105510).\n\nAnimal and laboratory research shows that Panax notoginseng reduces platelet aggregation by blocking the release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) from thrombin-activated platelet cells; the mechanism of action of this inhibited release is unclear (96220). Animal research also suggests that orally administered Panax notoginseng root can reduce fibrinogenemia, an increased level of fibrinogen in the blood (11487). Other animal research in rats shows that taking Panax notoginseng 118.8 mg/kg orally daily for 4 weeks, in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy, further enhances platelet inhibition when compared with dual antiplatelet therapy alone (109675).\nHemostatic effects\nPreliminary information suggests the dried root of Panax notoginseng applied topically may be useful as a hemostatic agent because it appears to shorten bleeding time (4056). Some ginsenosides have been shown to promote platelet aggregation (94323). This suggests that Panax notoginseng is useful in the healing of wounds. Other animal research in rats shows that taking Panax notoginseng 118.8 mg/kg orally daily for 4 weeks reduces gastric mucosal damage from dual antiplatelet therapy when compared with control (109675).\nHormonal effects\nIn vitro research shows that Panax notoginseng has estrogen-like activity. Studies on human breast cancer cells indicate that Panax notoginseng root, specifically its constituent ginsenonside-Rg1, acts as a phytoestrogen by stimulating human breast cancer cell proliferation (11488).\nImmune effects\nAlthough clinical evidence is lacking, laboratory research suggests that saponins from Panax notoginseng have various stimulatory effects on the immune system (94323). Further research is needed to determine if this might be useful for helping the immune system.\nMuscle protective effects\nIn humans, Panax notoginseng has a small benefit for preventing delayed muscle soreness following exercise. The mechanism is still not clear. However, there is some evidence of a small effect on inflammatory cytokines (94320)."

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, prescription pancreatic enzyme products are generally well tolerated when used at prescribed doses in adults and children.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Prescription pancreatic enzyme products can cause abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, irritation of the skin around the mouth and anus, nausea, steatorrhea, and vomiting.\n\nTopically: Pancreatic enzyme product powder is irritating to the skin, eyes, mucus membranes, and respiratory tract. Pancreatic enzyme products that are held in the mouth prior to swallowing can cause irritation of the mucosa, including ulceration and stomatitis.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Prescription pancreatic enzyme products can worsen glucose control. Extremely high doses have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and high uric acid levels in blood and urine.\n\nTopically: Inhalation of dust containing pancreatic enzyme products has been associated with asthma, bronchospasm, and pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions.\nDermatologic\nOrally, rash or skin conditions have been reported rarely in individuals taking prescription pancreatic enzyme products (67709, 98667). A pruritic rash occurred in one patient taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product in one clinical trial; this event was considered by the investigators to be possibly related to treatment (98667). Erythema also occurred in an 84-year-old patient who had taken a digestive enzyme supplement containing pancreatic enzymes and other enzymes (67709). In a case report, taking a supplemental form of pancreatic enzymes also containing hemicellulose and dried ox bile extract powder (Festal, Handok Inc) was thought to be the cause of an acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). The patient required an antihistamine and an oral and topical corticosteroid. Since this product contained more than one ingredient, the role of the pancreatic enzymes in this specific adverse event is unclear (98675).\n\nTopically, exposure to pancreatic enzyme product powder is irritating to the skin. Hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rash have been reported (15).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, prescription pancreatic enzyme products may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in some patients (67622, 98676, 98677). In a double-blind trial of a prescription pancreatic enzyme product compared with placebo in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and associated pancreatic duct obstruction, one patient developed diabetes during the study period (67708).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, prescription pancreatic enzyme products can cause abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, irritation of the skin around the mouth and anus, flatulence, nausea, steatorrhea, and vomiting. However, these symptoms can be controlled by following prescription dosing recommendations (67617, 67618, 67645, 67648, 67651, 67653, 67657, 67666, 67714, 98667)(98676, 99115, 99117, 99123, 99130). Doses of higher than 2500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal are not recommended unless medically necessary in order to prevent serious side effects, including fibrosing colonopathy and colonic strictures. These side effects are associated with the higher doses of lipase in prescription pancreatic enzyme products (2382, 67677, 67678, 67679, 67680, 67682, 67689, 67690, 67696, 67701, 99130).\n\nTopically, pancreatic enzyme products that are held in the mouth prior to swallowing can cause irritation of the mucosa, including ulceration and stomatitis (15).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, severe neutropenia has been reported with a pancreatic enzyme product. In one case report, a 61-year-old patient taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product for chronic pancreatitis developed agranulocytosis that persisted despite a trial of filgrastim. Upon discontinuation of the pancreatic enzyme product, marked improvement in neutropenia occurred within 7 days, with full resolution within 6 weeks (107411).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, headache and dizziness have been reported rarely in individuals taking prescription pancreatic enzyme products (67618, 98667, 99120).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nTopically, exposure to pancreatic enzyme product powder is irritating to the eyes. Hypersensitivity reactions such as watery eyes have been reported (15).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nTopically, exposure to pancreatic enzyme product powder is irritating to the respiratory tract. Hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing have been reported (15). Inhalation of dust containing pancreatic enzyme products has been associated with allergic rhinitis, asthma, bronchospasm, and pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions (11768, 11769, 67641).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, extremely high doses of pancreatic enzyme products containing more than 10,000 lipase units/kg body weight daily have been associated with high uric acid levels in blood and urine (67673, 67693, 67705). Rarely, kidney pain has been reported (98667).\nless\nOther\nPancreatic enzyme products are derived from porcine pancreatic tissue. Theoretically, these products may transmit viral diseases (115662, 115663). Hepatitis E virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been found in 3% to 55% of tested pancreatic enzyme products (115664, 115665). A small observational study has found that approximately 20% of patients with cystic fibrosis, who were taking pancreatic enzyme products, have hepatitis E virus antibodies. This proportion is higher than found in general populations. However, chronic and/or active hepatitis E infection was uncommon (115665). It is unclear from this study if the elevated hepatitis E viral load is related to pancreatic enzyme use, cystic fibrosis, other factors, or some combination. Another small observational study in patients with a solid organ transplantation has found that use of pancreatic enzyme products is not associated with hepatitis E virus infection (115664). Theoretically, if pancreatic enzyme products can transmit viral diseases, immunocompromised patients and patients with higher exposures, such as long durations of use or high doses, may be at a higher risk of infection (115663, 115664, 115665). However, preliminary observational data does not show that hepatitis E virus antibody presence differed in these groups (115665).\nless",

Improvement in fat absorption and digestion occurs in as little as 1 week. Symptoms such as gas and abdominal discomfort are also improved in most patients (98667, 98674, 98677). Various prescription products have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication (95743). These prescription pancreatic enzyme products are typically used at a starting dose of 500-1000 lipase units/kg body weight per meal to a maximum of 2500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal or 10,000 lipase units/kg body weight daily or 4000 lipase units/gram of fat daily (99130).\n\nDespite being beneficial for most patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, there is some evidence that prescription pancreatic enzyme products might not be beneficial in all patients. In patients with pancreatic insufficiency following gastrectomy for gastric cancer, research on prescription pancreatic enzyme products shows conflicting results (67617, 95744). Also, a small study shows that taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product for 26-30 days does not improve time to recovery from pancreatic insufficiency related to acute pancreatitis (99117). However, the small size of most of these studies limit the reliability of the results. One large clinical study shows that taking prescription pancreatic enzyme products for pancreatic insufficiency following pancreatoduodenectomy does not improve body weight or serum albumin levels. However, the dose used in this study was lower than recommended in the US guidelines, and adherence to the prescribed regimen was poor (102322).\n\nThere is no strong evidence that supplemental forms of pancreatic enzyme products help with digestion in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. Non-prescription pancreatic enzyme products are not recommended for this use.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral pancreatic enzyme products are beneficial in children with atopic dermatitis.\nA small clinical study in children with refractory atopic dermatitis and food allergies shows that taking a specific prescription pancreatic enzyme product (Creon, Solvay Pharma) 37,500 or 75,000 protease units with each meal and 18,750 or 37,500 protease units with each snack for 6 weeks reduces the severity of atopic dermatitis when compared with baseline (102321). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral pancreatic enzyme products are beneficial in children with HIV.\nNutrient malabsorption is common in individuals with HIV/AIDS, possibly leading to malnutrition. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 1-14 years with HIV shows that taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product (Creon 10,000) 1000 lipase units per gram of digested fat for 2 weeks reduces fecal fat loss when compared with baseline. Although improvement occurred in all of the children, a complete response, resulting in no steatorrhea, occurred in only 33% (99123). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral pancreatic enzyme products are beneficial in patients with NAFLD following pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nNAFLD is a common complication post-pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). A small clinical study in patients who developed NAFLD after PD shows that taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product (LipaCreon, marketed as Creon in the US) 1800 mg daily for 6 months improves the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio on computed tomography when compared with baseline, suggesting a reduction in hepatic fat content. Liver function was also improved, and most patients showed improvement in symptoms such as diarrhea (99113). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Although another preliminary clinical study shows that taking this prescription product for 12 months is as effective for preventing NAFLD after PD as taking specific non-prescription pancreatic enzyme products, including Politose (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) 1800 mg daily or Toughmac-E (Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) 3 grams daily for 10-12 months (99112), this study was underpowered and was not necessarily designed to detect between-group differences.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral pancreatic enzyme products improve nutrition status and health in patients with clinically overt exocrine pancreatic insufficiency resulting from pancreatic cancer.\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be a complication of pancreatic cancer. One clinical study in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer shows that taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product (Norzyme, Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG; not available in the US) 6-9 capsules daily for 8-24 weeks does not increase body weight, global assessment, quality of life, or survival when compared with placebo (99114). Another preliminary clinical study shows that taking a high-dose pancreatic enzyme product providing 48,000 lipase units per meal for 8 weeks during chemotherapy does not improve body mass index, nutritional parameters, or survival when compared with no treatment (99111). However, in both studies, clinically overt exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was absent in most of the patients. In a study in which clinically overt exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was more prevalent, taking a prescription pancreatic enzyme product (Panzytrat 25,000, Nordmark GmbH; not available in the US) 50,000 lipase units per meal three times daily for 8 weeks appears to increase body weight by about 5% when compared with placebo (67708).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate pancreatic enzyme products for these uses.",

Other enzymes obtained from pork pancreas include trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. These enzymes are used in the production of whey and milk protein hydrolysates, which are often used in infant and tube feeding formulas (106322, 106323, 106324).\nAllergy effects\nSome research suggests that people with atopic dermatitis have increased intestinal permeability. This might contribute to the severity of atopic dermatitis in patients who also have food allergies. One very small clinical study in children with atopic dermatitis and food allergies shows that taking pancreatic enzyme products for 6 weeks reduces intestinal permeability and improves symptoms of atopic dermatitis (102321).\nDigestive effects\nIn humans, use of pancreatic enzyme products increases their concentrations in the ileum, improving the digestion of fats and proteins (67694, 98667, 98674, 98676, 98677, 99115, 99116, 99118, 99119, 99120, 99122, 99124, 99125, 99126, 99127)."

Pantethine modestly improves blood lipid levels in patients with primary hyperlipoproteinemia, although it seems to be less effective than conventional hypolipidemic drugs.\nIn patients with primary hyperlipoproteinemia, taking pantethine orally, 600-900 mg daily for 2-3 months, appears to modestly lower triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, although it appears to be less effective than gemfibrozil and niacin derivatives, including acipimox (8318, 8319, 10238, 67755). The data comparing pantethine and fenofibrate are conflicting, with studies reporting both similar and reduced effectiveness (8316, 67754). A small clinical study also suggests that pantethine is more effective than bezafibrate for lowering triglycerides in patients with diabetes and types IIa, IIb, or IV hyperlipoproteinemia (67718).

A small clinical study in adults at low to moderate risk for cardiovascular disease shows that taking pantethine 600 mg daily for 7 weeks, followed by 900 mg daily for 8 weeks, modestly reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, but does not affect HDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo (97772). A small clinical study also suggests that taking pantethine 600-1200 mg daily for 7-24 months may improve lipid abnormalities in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis (10237).\n\nIntramuscular (IM) pantethine has also been investigated.

Pantethine is converted in the body to cysteamine which can form disulfides with cystine. The disulfides are rapidly excreted from cultured fibroblasts in vitro. This suggests that pantethine might lower lysosomal cystine levels in patients with cystinosis (8860).\nAntimalarial effects\nIn animal research, pantethine prevents a cerebral syndrome that occurs with Plasmodium infection. This may be due to preservation of the blood-brain barrier, protecting against negative effects of the parasite in the brain (67719).\nCardioprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that pantethine might reduce atherosclerosis (8322). Some clinical evidence indicates pantethine might decrease platelet aggregation (9123).\nLipid-lowering effects\nPantethine seems to have a beneficial effect on triglyceride and lipoprotein levels after conversion to cystamine which inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, reducing triglyceride synthesis. Pantethine might also reduce cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (8320, 8321, 8861, 8863), inhibiting the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (8865), and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation of low-density lipoproteins (8861, 8864).\nOcular effects\nPantethine seems to slow formation of experimentally-induced cataracts. However, in mice that develop age-related cataracts, pantethine doesn't seem to provide any protective effect (8323, 8324, 8325)."

Postoperative pain was modestly reduced at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery (105191).\nless\nPostoperative sore throat. It is unclear if pantothenic acid lozenges are beneficial for postoperative sore throat.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking two lozenges containing dexpanthenol, an analog of pantothenic acid, 200 mg 30 minutes prior to general anesthesia reduces the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat when compared with a benzydamine hydrochloride or placebo spray (67792).\nless\nPregnancy-related leg cramps.

It is unclear if topical dexpanthenol is beneficial for preventing or treating skin irritation due to sodium lauryl sulfate.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying dexpanthenol (Bepanthol Handbalsam), an analog of pantothenic acid, twice daily for 26 days does not prevent sodium lauryl sulfate-induced skin irritation (67785). However, dexpanthenol may be effective for treating skin irritation caused by sodium lauryl sulfate. Use of an ointment containing dexpanthenol 1% to 5% twice daily for up to 30 days following skin exposure to sodium lauryl sulfate seems to reduce skin water loss, skin roughness, and skin inflammation when compared to control (67802, 67806).\nless\nUlcerative colitis.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPantothenic acid is required for intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids (15). Dexpanthenol is converted in the body to pantothenic acid. Pantothenic acid is a precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), which is required in the acetylation reactions in gluconeogenesis; in the release of energy from carbohydrates; in the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids; and in the synthesis of sterols, steroid hormones, porphyrins, acetylcholine, and other compounds (15). Pantothenic acid also appears to be essential to normal epithelial function (15). Dietary deficiency of pantothenic acid has not been identified, but experimentally-induced deficiency has been associated with somnolence, fatigue, headache, paresthesia of the hands and feet followed by hyperreflexia and muscle weakness in the legs, cardiovascular instability, gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, changes in disposition, and increased susceptibility to infections (15).\nDermatologic effects\nDexpanthenol stimulates protein and lipid synthesis, which compensates for stratum corneum dehydration. Dexpanthenol reduces the increased stiffness of stratum corneum lipid lamellae and keratin filaments that characterize dry skin and atopic dermatitis (111262).\nNeurological effects\nPantothenic acid is found in high levels in the brain when compared with the plasma, where it functions in normal biochemical pathways as the coenzyme, CoA. Acetyl-CoA, the precursor of acetylcholine, is derived from CoA. Pantothenic acid levels were reduced in most brain regions of Huntington mutation carriers and patients with Alzheimer disease when compared to brains from individuals without these diseases (102769, 102770). The reason for this difference is unclear. Whether pantothenic acid supplementation would be useful in individuals with or at risk of these diseases is not known.\nStimulant laxative effects\nIn large parenteral doses, dexpanthenol has been reported to increase gastrointestinal peristalsis by stimulating acetylation of choline to acetylcholine, but efficacy has not been proven (15).\nWound healing effects\nDexpanthenol, an analogue of pantothenic acid, penetrates the epidermis and is enzymatically converted into vitamin B5, a precursor of coenzyme A. Coenzyme A is an essential constituent of lipid layers in the stratum corneum (105191, 111260). Dexpanthenol stimulates re-epithelialization and the proliferation of fibroblasts, thereby aiding in wound healing (105191, 11260). It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity (105191)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of pao pereira is the bark (90844, 101055). Pao pereira contains indole and beta-carboline alkaloids, including alstonine, serpentine, sempervirine, and flavopereirine; the indole alkaloids geissoschizoline, geissoschizoline N(4)-oxide, 1,2-dehydrogeissoschizoline, and geissospermine; pereirine; apogeissoschizine; and vellosine (27466, 27468, 27469, 27470).\nAntiandrogenic effects\nThere is interest in using pao pereira to treat or prevent benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Animal research in rats with exogenous testosterone-induced BPH shows that consuming pao pereira extract 20 mg/kg orally for 4 weeks reduces prostate size and prostatic epithelial cell thickness when compared with control. In vitro research also shows that pao pereira inhibits human prostate epithelial cell proliferation and reduces androgen receptor and 5-alpha reductase levels. In vitro research suggests that flavopereirine, a constituent of pao pereira, is responsible for most of these antiandrogenic effects (105520).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, pao pereira extract suppresses the growth of human prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines, as well as pancreatic cancer stem-like cells, and induces apoptosis. Also, in animal research, pao pereira extract suppresses tumor growth in immunodeficient mice xenografted with prostate or pancreatic cancer cells (27464, 101055). In other in vitro research flavopereirine, a beta-carboline alkaloid in pao pereira, selectively inhibits multiplication of human BCNU-resistant glioblastoma cells but has no effect on normal astrocyte multiplication (27465). Flavopereirine is also cytotoxic to human KB cervical cancer cells (27468). A pao pereira extract has in vitro activity against human ovarian cancer stem cell lines, decreasing nuclear beta-catenin levels and suppressing the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (114026).\nAntimalarial effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that pao pereira has antimalarial activity (27467). Additional in vitro research shows that geissoschizoline, geissoschizoline N(4)-oxide, 1,2-dehydrogeissoschizoline, and flavopereirine, indole alkaloids obtained from pao pereira, have some activity against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum, with flavopereirine being the most active. However, none of the alkaloids are as effective as chloroquine in either cell line (27468)."

Chymopapain A and B have a similar proteolytic spectrum to papain but are less potent (6).\nDermatologic effects\nIn a randomized controlled study, topical papain ameliorated soap-induced xerotic skin, most likely by increasing the proteolysis of desmosomes within corneocytes (67833).\nImmunomodulating effects\nLaboratory research shows that exposure of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to Wobenzym (pancreatin, bromelain, papain, lipase, amylase, trypsin, alpha chymotrypsin, and rutin) stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS are thought to have tumoricidal effects (962). Additionally, the multi-enzyme preparation also seems to induce the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a time and dose dependent manner (1364).\nWound healing effects\nIn several clinical trials and a case report, papain has been used to treat wounds, including pediatric burns (67827, 67836, 67841, 67842, 67843).

There is some concern that crude papain, a constituent of papaya latex, is teratogenic and embryotoxic (6); however, this might be due to extraneous substances rather than papain (11). Some evidence also suggests that high doses of papaya seed extract have abortifacient activity and can adversely affect fetal development (67870). Theoretically, eating large amounts of papaya seeds may have similar effects.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when the ripe fruit is consumed in amounts commonly found in foods.

Small clinical studies suggest that oral papaya leaf extract might increase platelet counts in patients with dengue fever.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small clinical studies in adults with dengue fever shows that taking papaya leaf extract reduces the duration of hospital stay by about 2 days and improves mean platelet count over the next five days by about 35 x 109 when compared with standard treatment. The most common dosing ranged from 500 mg to 3300 mg daily for five days in divided doses (102799). This finding is limited by imprecision and high risk of bias. One additional small clinical study in patients with severe thrombocytopenia due to dengue fever shows that taking a papaya leaf extract (Caripill, Micro Labs) 1100 mg three times daily for 5 days increases platelet counts by a greater amount through day 3 when compared with placebo, and reduces the median time to platelet recovery by one day (102800).\nless\nDiabetes.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of papaya are the leaf, fruit, seed, flower, and root (103863). Papaya leaf contains 2% papain and carpain (6). The unripe (green) fruit is also rich in papaya latex, a source of papain (101535). Papain is a mixture of enzymes that degrade protein, carbohydrates, and fats (515). However, papain is unstable in digestive juices, which raises questions about whether it can be effective when used orally (515). Ripe papaya fruit contains the papain inhibitor benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) (67900, 67904), as well as carotenoids (67861). Papaya seed contains saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids (103304).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that papaya has anti-inflammatory properties (67883, 67910, 67926, 67932). Preliminary clinical research shows that applying fermented papaya gel to the gums reduces levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with moderate to severe periodontitis (93090).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, both ripe and unripe papaya fruit inhibit the growth of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Shigella flexneri (67884). Other in vitro research shows that ethanol and methanol extracts of papaya fruit have antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram-negative drug-resistant strains of bacteria. However, both extracts appear to be less effective than ciprofloxacin. Aqueous extract of papaya fruit appears to have only weak antimicrobial activity in vitro (93084). Also, a small clinical study in children 8-12 years of age shows that using a mouthwash containing papaya leaf extract daily for 15 days reduces the concentration of Streptococcus mutans in saliva when compared with placebo (110434).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that papaya extract can inhibit cancer cell growth (67914). The anticancer effect of papaya extract may be due to benzyl isothiocyanate, a constituent of papaya extract that has been shown to arrest cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in vitro (67900, 67904). Other in vitro research shows that papaya leaf juice can inhibit the survival of human squamous cells carcinoma cells while remaining relatively nontoxic to normal human skin cells (93092).\nAntidiabetic effects\nVarious parts of the papaya plant are used for diabetes. Papaya seed extract inhibits the enzymes alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase in vitro. In animal research, papaya seed extract inhibits postprandial hyperglycemia (67902, 103304).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, papaya latex induces fungistatic effects against Candida albicans by causing cell wall degradation (67937).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research shows that fermented papaya improves levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide synthase, and superoxide dismutase and protects red blood cells (RBC) from oxidative damage in healthy humans, indicating antioxidant effects (67898, 67899). In humans, taking a fermented papaya preparation 9 grams daily for 4 weeks, prevents oxidative damage to red blood cells. Theoretically, this may help prevent the aging process and certain degenerative diseases (67898). Extracts of papaya leaf, fruit, root, seed, and bark also show antioxidant effects in vitro (93084, 103304).\nAntiparasitic effects\nCarpain, a constituent of papaya, is thought to be amebicidal (4009). The rind of raw papaya shows antimalarial activity in vitro (67866). Animal research shows that papaya latex can reduce worm burdens and increase weight gain in chickens with nematode infections (67913).\nAntiviral effects\nDengue fever is an infectious viral disease. Patients with dengue often present with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, and both symptoms appear to be related to clinical outcome (93086). Papaya leaf extract has been shown to improve thrombocyte counts in humans and animal models of dengue fever (93085, 99862). In animals, papaya leaf extract has also exhibited antiviral activity against dengue virus (99862). In vitro research shows that papaya extract may improve thrombocyte counts by upregulating the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-6, thrombopoietin, and stem cell factor (SCF) (93085, 99862). Papain, a chemical in papaya, appears to be the active constituent (93085). In humans with dengue fever, taking papaya leaf extract increased IL-6 and IL-4 levels (102800).\nCardiovascular effects\nCarpain, a constituent of papaya, might cause bradycardia (4009). In vitro, papaya seed extract causes irreversible relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. It seems to inhibit cellular contractility by increasing membrane permeability to calcium. Benzyl isothiocyanate is thought to be the active constituent that causes this effect (67867).\nDental effects\nThere is interest in using papaya extract to prevent cavities. In separate small clinical studies in adults and children, there was no difference in the saliva concentration of Streptococcus mutans when comparing daily use of mouthwashes containing papaya peel or leaf extract to standard-of-care mouthwashes (110433, 110434). One study compared a mouthwash containing papaya peel extract 3% to chlorhexidine 0.12% for 8 days in addition to tooth brushing three times daily (110433); the other study compared a mouthwash containing papaya leaf extract with a specific product containing sodium monofluorophosphate 0.05%, triclosan 0.03%, and xylitol 5% (Kidodent) for 15 days (110434). However, the mouthwash containing papaya leaf extract did reduce the concentration of Streptococcus mutans in saliva when compared with placebo (110434).\nEffect on iron bioavailability\nIn humans, papaya increases the absorption of iron from rice meal. It is thought that this effect is associated with the presence of ascorbic acid in papaya (67924).\nGalactagogue effects\nThere is interest in using papaya leaves to increase lactation. In a case series of 10 breast-feeding patients with insufficient lactation and infants 0-6 months of age suggests that drinking a blended mixture of papaya leaf, starfruit, water, and honey twice daily for 1 week might increase levels of prolactin when compared with baseline (105908). Theoretically, increased prolactin might increase milk production.\nImmunostimulant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that fermented papaya can augment nitric oxide synthesis and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in macrophages, suggesting an immunostimulant effect (67878). Also, extract of papaya leaf appears to decrease the production of IL-2 and IL-4, and increase the production of interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (67914). In addition, some in vitro evidence shows that papaya seed extract can enhance lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin, suggesting that this extract may enhance lymphocyte responsiveness to antigens (67883).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nCarpain, a constituent of papaya, might have central nervous system depressant or paralytic effects (4009). An animal model of Parkinson disease suggests that using a drink containing fermented unpolished rice, papaya, and seaweed can attenuate the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells, dopamine, and some but not all dopamine metabolites, indicating a potential neuroprotective effect (67885).\nReproductive effects\nAnimal research shows that papaya seed extracts can decrease fertility in males. Papaya seed extract has shown spermicidal, antispermogenic, and sperm immobilizing effects (67860, 67894). Other animal research shows that high doses of papaya seed extract have abortifacient properties in rats (67870).\nWound-healing effects\nIn humans, topical application of unripened papaya appears to increase desloughing, granulation, healing, and odor reduction of chronic ulcer wounds (67836, 67856). Also, application of papaya fruit pulp appears to increase desloughing and granulation of infected burns in pediatric patients (67827)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSome clinical research shows that PABA is passively absorbed from the small intestine and enters the portal circulation (68079). The bioavailability of PABA may decline with age. Factors such as bacterial overgrowth due to chronic atrophic gastritis and reduced secretion of gastric acid that may occur with aging might limit the absorption of PABA (12460). Clinical research suggests that the absorption of PABA increases with concomitant administration of antacids and digestive enzymes and decreases in patients with delayed gastric emptying (68070, 68066). Gastrokinetic agents, such as domperidone, appear to increase the rate of absorption of PABA (68043). Additional clinical research shows that topical PABA penetrates the stratum corenum, where it attaches to proteins by hydrogen bonding (68020). Other research suggests that a water-in-oil microemulsion speeds absorption and increases the amount of PABA absorbed (68094).\nMetabolism\nAfter absorption, PABA becomes acetylated and conjugated in the liver to glycine. Its major metabolites are para-acetoamidobenzoic acid (PAABA), para-acetamidohippuric acid (PAAHA), and para-aminohippuric acid (PAHA) (68091). Since the rate of metabolism may be decreased in the elderly, it has been suggested that advanced dosing schedules for validation of 24 hour urine collection completeness may be warranted (12460, 67959). However, some clinical research shows that the decline in PABA recovery with age cannot be overcome with advanced dosing schedules (12460). Clinical research shows that impaired liver function results in a reduced serum concentration of PABA metabolites after its ingestion (68079, 68080).\nExcretion\nPABA is excreted primarily in the urine, with small amounts found in the feces, bile, milk, and other secretions (68091). Clinical research shows that around 85% to 93% of ingested PABA is recovered in the urine (67993, 68059).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPara-aminobenzoic Acid (PABA) is a part of the folic acid molecule (16) and is found naturally in several foods including grains, eggs, milk, and meat (266). PABA was once considered to be a B vitamin, but is now considered a nonessential nutrient (16, 8954). Interestingly, pathogenic bacteria require PABA to synthesize folic acid. Sulfonamide antibiotics exert their antibacterial effect by inhibiting folic acid synthesis from PABA (16). Although blood, urine, sweat, and spinal fluid contain detectable amounts of PABA, deficiency of PABA has not been described in humans (266). Endogenous PABA seems to be involved in a number of biologic processes, but its precise role is not known (266). The bioavailability of PABA may decline with age. Factors such as bacterial overgrowth due to chronic atrophic gastritis and reduced secretion of gastric acid that may occur with aging might limit the absorption of PABA (12460).\nAntiarthritic effect\nPABA may act synergistically with cortisone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, it is theorized that the metabolism of cortisone by the liver is decreased when oral PABA and intramuscular cortisone are given simultaneously (4488).\nDermatologic effect\nPABA is taken orally to darken gray hair. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, PABA appears to have an effect on melanin metabolism (8953, 8954).\nPhotoprotective effect\nTopically, PABA is used as a sunscreen because it can act as a filter to block the penetration of ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the cells of the epidermis. PABA primarily blocks UVB sunlight, but may give some protection against UVA radiation at higher concentrations (272, 8952).\nTissue oxygenating effect\nPABA is exogenously administered for fibrotic diseases such as dermatomyositis, pemphigus, Peyronie disease, and scleroderma. Fibrosis might be caused by a long-term imbalance of serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity at the tissue level. MAO requires significant tissue oxygenation to function properly. PABA may enhance MAO activity by increasing tissue oxygenation (266, 8951)."

Its name was given by Spanish explorers to symbolize the Passion of Christ (11, 17374, 88195, 88200). It is native to the southeastern United States and Central and South America and has traditionally been used as a sedative (88199, 95038). In 1978, the FDA withdrew approval for passion flower to be used in over-the-counter sleep aids due to lack of submitted evidence (11).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally as a flavoring in foods. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists passion flower as a permitted food flavoring additive, to be used in the minimum quantity necessary (91203).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. Passion flower extract has been used with apparent safety at doses up to 800 mg daily for up to 8 weeks (88198, 102866). A specific passion flower extract (Pasipay, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) has been safely used at a dose of 45 drops daily for up to one month (8007, 95036). Also, a tea prepared by steeping 2 grams of the dried aerial parts of passion flower in 250 mL of boiling water for 10 minutes has been used nightly for 7 nights (17374).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of passion flower when used topically.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAnxiety. Oral passion flower has a long history of use as a sedative and may improve symptoms of anxiety in some patients.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific dried alcoholic extract of passion flower (Sedanxio, Tilman SA) 400 mg orally twice daily for 2-8 weeks reduces the severity of non-specific anxiety when compared to baseline (88198). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group. Passionflower has also been evaluated as an adjunct to conventional medication. One clinical small study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder shows that taking a specific passion flower extract (Pasipay, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) 15 drops three times daily along with sertraline 50-100 mg daily for one month reduces anxiety when compared with taking sertraline alone (95036).\n\nPassion flower has also been compared to conventional treatments. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking passion flower extract 90-180 mg daily reduces symptoms of non-specific anxiety when compared to baseline, and seems to be comparable to taking mexazolam (15391). A small clinical study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder shows that taking a specific passion flower extract (Pasipay, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) 45 drops orally once daily for 28 days reduces anxiety similarly to oxazepam 30 mg daily. However, passion flower appears to have a slower onset of action than oxazepam (8007). This finding is limited because it did not utilize a therapeutic dosing regimen for oxazepam, which is given 3-4 times daily to account for its short half-life.\n\nPassion flower has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination of herbal extracts containing passion flower 40 mg, valerian root, black horehound, and hawthorn (Euphytose, Bayer HealthCare) 6 times daily with meals for 14 days reduces anxiety and sympathetic and autonomic nervous system activation in response to a psychosocial stressor when compared with placebo (111222). It is unclear if these effects are due to valerian, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nInsomnia. Moderate-sized clinical studies suggest that oral passion flower may modestly improve total sleep time in patients with insomnia; however, its effects on sleep latency and maintenance are mixed.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with insomnia and stress shows that taking passion flower extract 600 mg daily at bedtime for 30 days increases total sleep time by about 30 minutes and reduces both the time to fall asleep and wake time after sleep onset by about 10 minutes when compared with placebo (114529). The validity of these findings is limited by lack of reporting on baseline use of medications or other substances which may impact sleep and exclusion of patients with severe insomnia.\n\nAnother moderate-sized clinical study in adults with insomnia shows that taking passion flower extract 60 mg every evening before bedtime for 2 weeks increases total sleep time by around 23 minutes, but doesn't seem to improve sleep efficiency, sleep latency, or awakening after sleep onset, when compared with placebo (102866). Additionally, a smaller clinical study in young adults with mild fluctuations in sleep quality shows that drinking tea prepared by steeping passion flower aerial parts 2 grams in 250 mL of boiling water for 10 minutes every evening, about an hour before bedtime for 7 nights, improves subjective ratings of sleep quality, but not other sleep parameters, when compared with placebo (parsley tea) (17374).\n\nPassion flower has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study in adults with primary insomnia shows that taking a specific combination product containing passion flower 80 mg, valerian 300 mg, and hops 30 mg (NSF-3, M/s Tablets India) orally at bedtime for 2 weeks yields similar effects on subjective measures of sleep as zolpidem 10 mg nightly (88193).\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. Oral passion flower modestly reduces preoperative anxiety.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults awaiting dental surgery or inguinal hernia repair surgery shows that taking a specific passion flower extract (Pasipay, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) reduces preoperative anxiety when compared with placebo. Passion flower extract was given as 20 drops or 500 mg 90 minutes prior to surgery, with or without another dose on the evening before surgery (88195, 88196). Another small clinical study shows that drinking 5 mL of syrup containing passion flower aqueous extract (Passiflora syrup, Sandoz) 700 mg orally 30 minutes before epidural catheter insertion for inguinal hernia repair surgery seems to attenuate anxiety; the placebo group experienced a significant increase in anxiety (88194). A small study in young adults undergoing molar tooth extraction shows that taking passion flower extract 590 mg 1 hour before surgery reduces scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) from 36 to 33. The clinical relevance of this change is unclear; the STAI-S ranges from 0 to 80. A concurrent placebo group saw a similar reduction from 38 to 35 (114800). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison between groups.\n\nPassion flower has also been compared with conventional medications. Three clinical studies show that taking passion flower prior to dental surgery decreases preoperative anxiety similarly to oral midazolam 15 mg. One study used passion flower 260 mg, administered 30 minutes prior to the surgery (95038), the second used 500 mg, administered 60 minutes prior (104206), and the third used 600 mg, administered 45 minutes prior (110014). Of the two studies that evaluated patient preference, patients in one study preferred midazolam, possibly due to its ability to cause perioperative amnesia (95038), whereas there was no preference in the other study (110014). Another clinical study shows that taking passion flower 1000 mg one hour prior to elective minor or moderate surgery reduces preoperative anxiety similarly to melatonin 6 mg; however, passion flower seems to cause more cognitive impairment than melatonin (95037).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAdjustment disorders. Oral passion flower has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in patients with adjustment disorder with anxious mood shows that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Euphytose, Bayer Healthcare) three times daily seems to decrease anxiety symptoms when compared with placebo. One tablet contains the dry extracts of passion flower 40 mg, valerian 40 mg, hawthorn 10 mg, and black horehound 10 mg, as well as the caffeine-containing stimulant herbs kola nut 15 mg and guarana 15 mg (6250). It is unclear if this effect is due to passion flower, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAlcohol use disorder. Oral passion flower has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms shows that taking one capsule of a combination product (Relief) three times daily for 15 days reduces the frequency of excessive sweating, reduces serum liver enzyme levels, and improves appetite and quality of life when compared to baseline. One capsule contains passion flower extract 30 mg, black seed extract 100 mg, cocoa extract 90 mg, radish extract 165 mg, and saffron extract 15 mg (97280). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral passion flower is beneficial in patients with ADHD.\nA small clinical trial in children aged 6-13 years with ADHD shows that taking tablets of passion flower (Pasipay, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) 0.02 mg/kg orally twice daily for 8 weeks reduces parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms no better than taking methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) (88197).\nless\nBenzodiazepine withdrawal. It is unclear if oral passion flower is beneficial for benzodiazepine withdrawal.\nA retrospective study in adults with depression or anxiety who are taking an antidepressant and undergoing a benzodiazepine taper suggests that taking a specific dry extract of passion flower (Tractana, Baldacci) 200-600 mg daily for 3 months is associated with a modestly increased rate of benzodiazepine dose reduction and discontinuation at 1 and 3 months when compared with a control group undergoing a taper without passion flower (111651). These dose reductions were maintained at a 12-month follow-up in the group that took passion flower extract for 3 months; however, no follow-up was conducted for the control group (115913). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a placebo group, the inconsistent follow-up, and the retrospective study design.\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral passion flower has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild CHF shows that taking a combination of passion flower and hawthorn extracts 2 mL three times daily for 6 weeks increases six-minute walking distance when compared with placebo. However, it does not appear to improve exercise capacity on a bicycle ergometer test (19201). It is unclear if this effect is due to passion flower, hawthorn, or the combination. Additionally, hawthorn has been evaluated alone for the management of CHF, with some research suggesting that although it may improve symptoms, it may also be associated with worsened clinical outcomes.\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there is interest in using oral passion flower for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of passion flower for this condition.\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there is interest in using oral passion flower for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of passion flower for this purpose.\nMuscle cramps. Although there is interest in using oral passion flower for muscle cramps, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of passion flower for this purpose.\nNeuropathic pain. Although there is interest in using oral passion flower for neuropathic pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of passion flower for this condition.\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral passion flower helps to prevent opioid withdrawal.\nA small preliminary clinical study in adults who are completing an inpatient withdrawal program for opioid addiction shows that taking passion flower liquid extract 60 drops, in combination with clonidine 0.8 mg daily, is better than clonidine alone when used for reducing symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and agitation. However, the combination is no better than clonidine alone for reducing physical symptoms such as tremor and nausea (2303).\nless\nSeizures. Although there is interest in using oral passion flower for seizures, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of passion flower for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if oral passion flower reduces stress.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with stress and insomnia shows that taking passion flower 600 mg daily at bedtime for 30 days modestly reduces stress when compared with placebo (114529). It is unclear how changes in stressors over the course of the study may have affected results. Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a specific combination product (Relaxane, Max Zeller Söhne AG) containing passion flower 90 mg, lemon balm 50 mg, valerian 90 mg, and butterbur 90 mg three times daily for 3 days modestly reduces subjective anxiety scores during social stress testing when compared with placebo or no treatment (97276). It is unclear if this effect is due to passion flower, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate passion flower for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the pharmacokinetics of passion flower.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of passion flower are the above ground parts (88195). Passion flower contains flavonoids including vitexin, isovitexin, orientin, isoorientin, apigenin, quercetin, vicenin, lucenin, saponarin, swertisin, schaftoside, and kaempferol (88199, 88200, 95036). It also contains the indole alkaloids harman, harmol, harmin, harmalol, and harmalin (8811, 9558, 15339, 88199, 88200). Other constituents include glycosides, carbohydrates, amino acids, benzopyrones, chrysin, and pyrone derivatives such as maltol and ethyl maltol (88200, 95036). Fatty acids, as well as phenolic, linoleic, linolenic, palmitic, oleic, and myristic acids are also present, along with essential oils (88199). Experts do not agree about whether passion flower contains the cyanogenic glycoside gynocardine (9558).\nHepatic effects\nIn vitro studies suggest that passion flower decreases intracellular glutathione concentrations. Though it is theorized that the decreased glutathione levels may be due to inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transferase, further investigation found that passion flower actually increases the activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase. The mechanism of intracellular glutathione inhibition by passion flower remains unclear (110704).\nNeurologic effects\nSedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant activity have been reported with passion flower extracts in animals (8811, 9558, 19235, 68298, 68309, 88199, 91205). Data suggest that passion flower and its flavonoid constituents inhibit uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into neuronal synapses, and have affinity for GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (88199, 91204, 115913). Some studies report that the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity of passion flower is similar to that of benzodiazepines and can be antagonized by flumazenil. This suggests that it binds to the benzodiazepine site on GABA(A) receptors (68298, 91205, 95037), although some studies suggest it binds to the GABA site on GABA(A), rather than the benzodiazepine site (88199, 91204). The constituents thought to be responsible for these effects are isovitexin, benzoflavone, chrysin, and/or maltol (95036). One animal study shows that intraperitoneal administration of higher doses of passion flower extract (Sintocalmy) containing isovitexin and vitexin seem to attenuate withdrawal behavior in morphine-dependent mice given naloxone when compared with saline. Theoretically, this occurs due to the modulation of GABA receptors by passion flower extract constituents (105094).\n\nSome animal data suggests that the constituent maltol can cause CNS depression, reduce spontaneous motor activity, and prolong barbiturate-induced sleep time. Very high doses also seem to have anticonvulsant activity in animal models. Ethyl maltol has similar activity, but appears to have more potent anticonvulsant activity and less potent effects on motor activity (15339). Overall, ethyl maltol appears to be less toxic than maltol when used in toxic doses (15340). However, it is unlikely that there is enough maltol in passion flower supplements to cause these effects in humans.\n\nThe indole alkaloids harman, harmin, harmalin, harmol, and harmalol reportedly have monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) properties, although they are present in only small amounts in passion flower extracts (4002, 88199, 95037). Due to the small amounts of these indole alkaloids in passion flower, the sedative effects of maltol and ethyl maltol might mask these effects (15339)."

Extracts contain a volatile fraction (essential oil) consisting of 87%-96% sesquiterpenoids, and a non-volatile fraction containing mainly flavonoid derivatives (112067). Constituents of the non-volatile fraction include epi-catechin, caffeoyl quinic acid, kaempferol glycosides including kaempferitrin, rutin, myricitrin, quercetin glycosides, isorhamnetin glycosides, estragole, eugenol, beta-caryophyllene, benzoquinone, anthracene, octadecane, and trigonelline (27473, 27475, 100154, 112067).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe first reports describing hypoglycemic activity of pata de vaca were published in 1929 and 1931 (27483). Most animal research shows that pata de vaca extract, and the constituent kaempferitrin, have hypoglycemic effects, attenuating insulin resistance, and reducing urinary glucose excretion (27480, 27481, 27482, 27483, 27486, 27487, 27489, 112068), although some conflicting evidence from animal and preliminary clinical research exists (27471, 27490). Pata de vaca does not seem to preserve insulin secretion from beta cells (112068). Potential mechanisms for the hypoglycemic effects include inhibition of alpha-amylase, to reduce breakdown of polysaccharides in the gut to glucose and reduce postprandial hyperglycemia, and alterations in the intrinsic activity of the glucose transporter (27483, 27486, 112067). Flavonoids in pata de vaca improve insulin sensitivity by phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate, increasing glucose uptake in the gastrocnemius muscle, and increasing adiponectin secretion to regulate glucose levels (112066, 112068).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary evidence from animal and in vitro research suggests that pata de vaca has antioxidant properties (27487, 27490, 27491, 27492). This activity is thought to be due to flavonoids in the leaves (112067)."

Patchouli oil contains pogostone, as well as the naturally occurring tricyclic sesquiterpenes beta-patchoulene and patchouli alcohol (100670, 100673). Additional constituents include eugenol, alpha-bulnesene, rosmarinic acid, beta-caryophyllene, azulene, aciphyllene, alpha-bulnesene, seychellene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-guaiene, and delta-guaiene (100672, 104776, 104779). The major volatile constituents of patchouli oil include patchouli alcohol, alpha-patchoulene, beta-patchoulene, carvone, eucalyptol, linalool, alpha-terpinene, beta-selinene, and beta-caryophyllene (104777).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, beta-patchoulene, a constituent of patchouli oil, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. Administering beta-patchoulene 2.5-10 mg/kg orally once daily for 7 days prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation in a mouse model. It also inhibited the increase of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and prevented elevations of malondialdehyde in the lung tissue (100670).\nAnticancer effects\nPatchouli alcohol, a constituent of patchouli oil, has demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro. Patchouli alcohol decreases tumor cell growth and increases apoptosis of human colorectal cancer cells by attenuating the expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and inducing the transcription of NF-kB (100673).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro and in animal models, patchouli alcohol, a constituent of patchouli oil, has activity against Helicobacter pylori (100668). The constituent pogostone appears to have antibacterial and antifungal activity (11).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using patchouli alcohol, a constituent of patchouli oil, for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders. In mice, administering patchouli alcohol 1.25-5 mg/kg daily for 14 days eradicated Helicobacter pylori infection and reduced gastritis (100668). When patchouli alcohol was applied to the colonic smooth muscle from rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, it reduced contractions and stress-induced neurotransmitter release (100671).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using patchouli oil to decrease hepatic lipogenesis via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Animal research shows that administering patchouli oil 100-400 mg/kg orally to rats with hepatic steatosis reduces liver enzyme levels, liver steatosis, and liver index scores after 4 weeks. It also decreases low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels and increases high-density lipoprotein levels. These effects were similar to those seen in rats treated with vitamin E (104779).\nInsect repellent effects\nThere is interest in using patchouli oil as a mosquito repellent and insecticide. The patchouli oil constituents eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, and benzaldehyde may have insecticidal activity against insects in stored grain (11).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research shows that inhalation of patchouli oil daily decreases food intake and body weight in rats fed high-fat diets. These effects were more pronounced with lower doses of patchouli oil. Some researchers have suggested that these effects are due to modulation of leptin and insulin secretion (104777)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of pau d'arco are the bark and the wood. They contain flavonoids, cyclopentene dialdehydes, benzoic acid derivatives, benzaldehyde derivatives, quinones, furanonaphthoquinones, naphthoquinones, iridoids, coumarins, flavonoids including quercetin, and anthraquinones (18057, 68332). The inner bark also contains oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids, glucose, fructose, and sucrose, oxalic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and tocopherols (92178). The most studied constituents are the naphthoquinones such as lapachol, and its isomer, beta-lapachone, which are found primarily in the inner lining of the bark. When the whole bark and/or heartwood are used, older, non-dividing cells are present which dilute the active constituents (18057).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCyclopentene derivatives, including several esters called avellaneines, isolated from pau d'arco have anti-inflammatory effects in vitro (18054, 92183). Also, animal research shows that lapachol reduces carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice (91941). Other animal research suggests that the anti-inflammatory effects of pau d'arco extract are due to suppression of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide production via blocking of mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase II (COX-2) and NO synthase enzymes, and down regulation of macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses (68332, 92181, 92183). Beta-lapachone is reported to inhibit COX-2 and reduce expression of mRNA, inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha (92181).\nAntibacterial effects\nSeveral pau d'arco constituents have antibacterial activity in vitro. Suggested mechanisms include interference with electron transport and cellular respiratory mechanisms (92181). Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid has strong activity against Clostridium paraputrificum, moderate activity against Helicobacter pylori, and weak activity against Clostridium perfringens (18055). Another constituent, 2-(hydroxymethyl)-anthraquinone, has strong in vitro activity against Helicobacter pylori (18056). Lapachol and beta-lapachone have activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterococcus and Bacillus species, and various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, with beta-lapachone being more potent than lapachol (91940, 92181). Beta-lapachone and other naphthoquinone constituents of pau d'arco also have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which may be synergistic with conventional antimicrobial drugs (68317, 92179).\nAnticancer effects\nThe beta-lapachone constituent of pau d'arco inhibits topoisomerase I which is an enzyme involved in the supercoiling of DNA, can trigger cancer cell apoptosis, and has antiangiogenic effects (18057, 68318, 68320, 68321). It has also been suggested that lapachol and other naphthoquinones in pau d'arco can insert between the base pairs in the DNA helix, inhibiting DNA replication and RNA synthesis (92181).\nAntifungal effects\nPau d'arco and its constituents lapachol and beta-lapachone have activity in vitro against Epidermophyton floccosum and various Candida species (91940, 92181). The mechanism may involve interference with the fungal cell membrane (92181). Beta-lapachone appears to be more potent than lapachol (91940).\nAntiplatelet and anticoagulant effects\nPau d'arco has been shown to reduce platelet aggregation in vitro and increase bleeding time in vivo (68319, 91939). Naphthoquinones in pau d'arco are thought to prolong prothrombin time by interfering with the actions of vitamin K (18057). The effects of pau d'arco on clotting are reversible by vitamin K (91939).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that pau d'arco extract may exert a gastroprotective effect against ethanol or ibuprofen-induced ulceration by causing proliferation of cells in the mucus layer, increasing gastric mucus production and reducing gastric acid secretion (68331, 92180).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research suggests that the pau d'arco constituent beta-lapachone can accelerate wound healing when applied topically (68333). Suggested mechanisms are enhanced proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, facilitation of migration of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and increased release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from macrophages (68333)."

Additionally, a very small clinical study in trained adults shows that taking pea protein 24 grams twice daily during an 8-week high-intensity functional training program improves muscle strength to a similar degree as whey protein, while neither supplement appears to impact muscle thickness or body mass (102013). The small study size and lack of an isocaloric, protein-free control limits conclusions that can be drawn from this study.\nless\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral pea protein for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of pea protein for this purpose.\nPostoperative recovery. Oral pea protein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing gastrointestinal resection due to cancer shows that consuming a beverage (Providextra, Fresenius Kabi) containing pea protein hydrolysate 11% and carbohydrates 89% the night before (400 mL) and the morning of surgery (200 mL) reduces postoperative hospital stay by almost 2-fold when compared with conventional preoperative fasting (94933). It is unclear if these findings are due to pea protein, carbohydrates, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate pea protein for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn clinical trials, pea protein powder has been added to beverages and protein bars in quantities ranging from 11% to 90.8% (95426, 94933, 94934). A pea protein hydrolysate has also been evaluated in clinical research. The hydrolysate was prepared from a pea protein isolate by creating a 6% w/v aqueous slurry, heating to 55℃, adjusting to a pH of 8, and adding thermolysin for 3 hours (94973).",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with pea protein.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, pea protein is broken down to amino acids and small peptides by the acid and pepsin in the stomach. It is further broken down by pancreatic proteases in the small intestine. The resulting amino acids and small peptides are systemically absorbed (11120).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPea protein used medicinally is extracted from peas (Pisum sativum) that contain approximately 25% crude protein (94971, 94981). The proteins present include water-soluble proteins, such as lipoxygenase, protease inhibitors, and lectins, and globulin storage proteins such as legumin and vicilin (94970). Pea protein contains all nine essential amino acids, although methionine is present in only small concentrations. The main amino acids in pea protein are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, arginine, leucine, valine, and lysine (95426, 94935). Plain cooked peas average about 8% protein, but pea protein supplements are available as concentrates, isolates, or hydrolysates containing 60-95% protein (102012).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model of colitis, pea protein demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. A specific pea protein, the Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor, appears to be responsible for this effect (94976). In laboratory research, pea protein hydrolysate inhibited inflammatory processes, including the production of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage activity (94977).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThere is interest in using pea protein for obesity and appetite suppression. However, the effects of pea protein on obesity are unknown. Furthermore, pea protein seems to have inconsistent effects on appetite. In human research, 20 grams of pea protein decreased food intake 30 minutes later, but not 2 hours later (94937, 86100). In other clinical research, consuming 10 grams of pea protein reduced hunger over the next 2-3 hours, whereas 15 grams of pea protein reduced hunger over the next 4 hours (85896, 94980). This suggests that there may be a short-term impact of pea protein on appetite, but further research is needed to clarify this effect.\n\nTaking pea protein by mouth might limit its effects on satiety hormones (94936, 85896). Intraduodenal administration of pea protein appears to be more satiating than oral pea protein, which undergoes digestion prior to reaching the duodenum. In obese humans, intraduodenal administration, but not oral intake, of pea protein increased satiety by altering levels of hormones, such as cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (94936).\n\nThere is also interest in using pea protein to reduce appetite. However, preliminary clinical research in healthy adult males shows that taking 40 grams of a specific pea protein (NOW Foods) as a single dose does not reduce self-reported appetite, food intake, or resting energy expenditure when compared with taking 40 grams of whey protein (104759).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn laboratory research, two peptides isolated from pea protein were found to have anti-adhesive properties, but not cytotoxic effects, against Helicobacter pylori (94979).\nGlycemic effects\nThere is interest in using pea protein for diabetes. A small crossover trial in healthy adults shows that drinking a beverage containing pea protein 25-50 grams and glucose 50 grams daily for 3 days reduces postprandial glucose levels and stimulates insulin release in a dose-dependent manner when compared with glucose alone. No changes in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels were reported, suggesting that a different mechanism may be responsible for any glycemic effects (108880).\nHypolipidemic effects\nPlant proteins are usually associated with hypolipidemic effects when compared with animal proteins. In both human and animal research, pea protein has demonstrated hypolipidemic activity (94934, 94971). Animal research suggests that pea protein might promote increased cellular uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and decreased production of fatty acids in the body. It is also theorized that specific water-soluble peptides found in plant proteins play a role in these hypolipidemic effects (94971, 94975). Pea protein might also result in increased excretion of cholesterol-containing bile (94972).\nHypotensive effects\nIn animal research, pea protein peptides have demonstrated hypotensive activity, which is possibly related to direct effects on the renin-angiotensin system (94973, 94978).\nImmune effects\nIn animal research, pea protein hydrolysate increased the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages. Pea protein hydrolysate also increased the concentration of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and active white cells in the gut mucosa (94977). The constituents of pea protein thought to be responsible for allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are the storage proteins vicilin and convicilin (102012).\nMuscle growth and repair\nThere is interest in using pea protein as a supplemental protein source for those involved in exercise training. Supplemental protein and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), particularly leucine, can stimulate muscle protein synthesis and remodeling, suggesting the potential of pea protein to increase muscle mass and strength and reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness and damage. Plant protein supplements such as pea protein are theorized to have less anabolic potential due to lower levels of BCAAs, particularly leucine, and/or poorer digestibility and amino acid bioavailability when compared with animal protein (111730). However, some brands of pea protein, such as NUTRLYS (Roquette) have protein digestibility scores equivalent to whey and casein and are naturally rich in BCAAs (95426). Research on amino acid availability, uptake and utilization of pea protein, and its effect on mixed muscle protein synthesis is needed (102013). While plant protein (mix of 50% wheat protein hydrolysate, 25% corn protein isolate, and 25% pea protein concentrate) shows similar stimulation of muscle protein synthesis when compared with milk protein (111730), it is unclear if pea protein alone has a similar effect."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRefined peanut oil should contain only triglyceride fats. Free fatty acids, sterols, pigments, glucosides, waxes, hydrocarbons, and non-fats such as aflatoxins and proteins are removed through the refining process. Less refined oil may retain aflatoxins, as well as compounds giving a nutty flavor and aroma to the oil (94311).\n\nThe major fatty acid constituents in peanut oil include oleic acid (C18:1) (52%), linoleic acid (C18:2) (32%), and palmitic acid (C16:0), as part of triglycerides. Unsaturated fatty acids make up 80% of the total. The composition might differ slightly depending on specific variety, maturity of the peanut, and growth conditions. Peanut oil also contains small amounts of long chain fatty acids, 20-24 carbons in length. Fatty acids are found in small amounts as phospholipids, free fatty acids, or diacylglycerides. The levels depend on maturity and quality of the peanut or the level of refining of the oil. Peanut oil also contains the phytosterols, beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (94311).\n\nOther constituents found in small amounts in peanut oil include the tocopherols, especially alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, squalene and triterpenic alcohols, such as beta-amyrin, cyclobranol, and cycloartenol and derivatives. Although resveratrol is found in peanuts, the oil does not appear to contain this phenolic compound (94311).\nAnti-cancer effects\nSome population research has found that eating peanuts might reduce the risk for some types of cancer. However, it is not clear if peanut oil has the same benefits. One constituent of interest, resveratrol, is low in peanut oil. Other constituents of interest, the phytosterols, are found in peanut oil (94311).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nPopulation research has found that eating peanuts might reduce the risk of diabetes. In laboratory research, peanut oil high in oleic acid enhanced insulin production from beta cells. In animal models of obesity and diabetes, peanut oil high in oleic acid reduced the effects of inflammatory cytokines and reduced levels of glucose in the blood (94311).\nCardiovascular effects\nPopulation studies have found that people who eat nuts have a lower risk of developing heart disease. Individual who eat nuts, including peanuts, 4-5 times a week have a 30% to 50% reduction in cardiovascular disease and reduced levels of cholesterol in the blood (4264, 94311). Also, peanut oil might have a small effect on blood pressure reduction in people without hypertension (94311). This benefit is at odds with some preliminary animal evidence that suggests peanut oil is atherogenic, perhaps due to the triglyceride structure or the presence of a lectin (4265, 4266). Other research in animal models suggests that peanut oil reduces the development of atherosclerosis and is anti-inflammatory (94311). Peanuts contain beta-sitosterol and resveratrol, which may contribute to cardioprotective and cancer protective activity (4263, 4267). However, peanut oil contains only small amounts of these compounds. The high monounsaturated, low saturated fat content of peanut oil is thought to prevent heart disease and lower cholesterol (94311)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe shorter chain, modified citrus pectin might be absorbed in small amounts (63347, 63351).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPectin is a soluble fiber (polysaccharide) in fruits, especially citrus and apples. It is found in the cell walls of plant tissue and helps give plants rigidity. The primary unit in pectin is D-galacturonic acid (12575, 15019, 92473).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using the modified citrus pectin (Pectasol, Econugenics) for various forms of cancer. Animal models suggest that modified citrus pectin might decrease breast and colon cancer tumor growth and also decrease metastasis of breast, colon, and prostate cancer. It is theorized that modified citrus pectin might bind the receptor galectin-3 and block tumor cell adhesion and clumping, and therefore, reduce metastasis (15020). However, some research suggests that apoptosis is not mediated through galectin-3, but is related to a specific structural characteristic of pectin (16059).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nPectin may relieve diarrhea by increasing the absorption of salt and water. Pectin may also slow gut motility and increase gastrointestinal transit time (12575). Pectin is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to short-chain fatty acids in the colon. This potentially increases the pH and protects against germs (19705). In the colonic mucosa, pectin may also act as an energy source, increase protein synthesis, and improve oxygen use (12575).\nAnti-GERD effects\nPectin might reduce the amount of stomach contents refluxed into the esophagus. Like alginic acid (Gaviscon), it floats on top of the stomach contents and may serve as a barrier between the stomach acid and the esophagus. Pectin does not affect the pH in the stomach. It might be useful for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), but more clinical research is needed before pectin can be recommended for this use (10431).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPectin may have anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking pectin 20 grams daily for 1 month reduces serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect of pectin on other inflammatory markers (115592).\nHeavy metal effects\nThere is interest in using pectin to reduce heavy metal toxicity. Pectin is thought to bind heavy metals in the GI tract and facilitate their fecal elimination. Taking pectin orally seems to decrease lead and strontium absorption in the GI tract. Taking a specific low-molecular weight modified citrus pectin (Pectasol, Econugenics) 15 grams for 5 days followed by 20 grams on the sixth day seems to significantly increase urinary excretion of arsenic, cadmium, and lead in healthy individuals with a normal load of heavy metals (15019). It is theorized that this urinary excretion is increased due to absorption of the modified citrus pectin and then chelation of the metals in the blood stream and subsequent urinary elimination.\nHypolipidemic effects\nPectin is thought to decrease levels of cholesterol in the blood by increasing gut viscosity thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol re-absorbed in to the body in bile forcing the body to make more bile from cholesterol. The degree of esterification and molecular weight of the pectin appear to play a role in cholesterol reduction (92473).\nQuercetin-absorption effects\nIn humans, pectin increases the absorption of quercetin by a mechanism likely related to its viscosity (92478).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human research, consuming pectin with a meal delays gastric emptying (30499). Pectin also appears to reduce appetite, but not food intake. However, gelled pectin might be more effective than viscous or bulking pectin and taking the gelled pectin in capsule form appears to be more effective than liquid form (92481). It is unclear if these results impact blood glucose response to a meal; however, insulin responses are smaller (30499, 92481)."

The gut microbiota appear to play a role in the metabolism of the roburins to the urolithins (93285, 93305).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of pedunculate oak are the wood, bark, and leaf. Constituents of pedunculate oak wood include ellagitannins such as grandinin and roburins. Other constituents include ellagic acid and gallic acid. The wood also contains triterpene saponins and their glycosides (93297). In the human diet, pedunculate oak wood constituents are obtained from the consumption of wines and spirits stored in oak barrels (86394, 93284, 93285, 93304).\n\nSimilar tannin constituents are found in the leaves. Seasonal variation appears to affect the content of the tannins in the leaves (93296).\nAnti-allergic effects\nSome evidence suggests that pedunculate oak might have anti-allergic effects. In vitro research shows that pedunculate oak bark extract inhibits degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators from basophils and mast cells (93298). Other research shows that taking pedunculate oak wood extract can reduce histamine-induced wheal and flare reactions in humans (93300). These effect are attributed to the ellagitannins content of pedunculate oak (93298, 93300).\nAntioxidant effects\nAny potential effects of pedunculate oak are thought to be related to the antioxidant activities of the wood constituents, mainly the wood tannins. Laboratory research has suggested that these antioxidant activities play a role in anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects (93285). In humans, use of a specific pedunculate oak wood extract (Robuvit) increases the total antioxidant capacity of the blood, possibly by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Oxidation of lipids and protein products is reduced. These antioxidant activities are thought to play a role in the various clinical effects seen in clinical research, including reducing edema, fatigue, and liver damage (93284, 93285, 93289, 93290, 93299, 93301, 93304). The antioxidant effects of pedunculate oak wood extract might also play a role in improving exercise performance (93288) and increasing energy in aging individuals (93285). Antioxidant activity of pedunculate oak leaves has also been shown in laboratory models and may be higher than the wood (93302, 93303).\nCardiovascular effects\nAlthough clinical information is lacking, at least some evidence suggests that pedunculate oak wood extract inhibits cardiovascular risk factors such as homocysteine (93299)."

Oral Pelargonium sidoides may be beneficial in adults and children with acute bronchitis when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.\nSeveral clinical studies and a meta-analysis of 6 small-to-moderate sized clinical studies in adults and children with acute bronchitis show that taking Pelargonium sidoides extract daily, starting within 48 hours of symptom onset, significantly reduces symptoms such as cough intensity and rales after 7 days of treatment when compared with placebo. Additionally, patients report an earlier onset of effect and increased remission of cough when compared with placebo (14258, 16647, 16649, 16651, 81557, 81565, 94580, 110015, 112124). Another meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in children aged 6-10 years with acute bronchitis or acute tonsillopharyngitis shows that taking a specific Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 20 drops three times daily for 6 days reduces the amount of acetaminophen co-medication required to treat fever when compared with placebo (112126). However, most of the outcomes in these studies were patient-reported. Additionally, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant.\n\nVarious formulations of Pelargonium sidoides have been investigated. A specific liquid extract of Pelargonium sidoides containing the active ingredient EPs 7630 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) has been used in most studies (14258, 16647, 16649, 16651, 81557, 81565, 94580, 110015, 112124). In adults, this specific extract is administered as 30 drops of solution three times daily or in tablet form as 10-30 mg three times daily for 7 days (14258, 16649, 16651, 81557, 81565, 94580). In children, this specific extract is administered as 10 drops three times daily in patients under 7 years of age or 20 drops three times daily for 7 days in those 7 years of age and older (16651, 112124). In children aged 1-5 years of age, this specific extract is also available as a syrup dosed at 2.5 mL 3 times daily, which is equivalent to 10 drops of solution 3 times daily (112123). Some studies used extracts in tablet form; however, these tablet formulations have only been shown to be beneficial in adults, not in children (17417, 94580).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) may decrease the frequency of exacerbations, improve symptoms, and reduce the need for antibiotics in patients with COPD; however, it does not seem to reduce the overall risk of exacerbations.\nOne clinical study in patients with moderate to severe COPD shows that taking Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 1.5 mL three times daily in addition to standard treatment for 24 weeks lengthens the average time to COPD exacerbation by 14 days when compared with placebo (97319). The addition of Pelargonium sidoides to standard therapy is also associated with a reduction in total COPD symptoms, antibiotic use, and missed workdays (97319, 97325). However, Pelargonium sidoides does not seem to decrease the overall number of COPD exacerbations (97325).\nless\nCommon cold. Oral Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) may reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms and improve sleep quality in adults with the common cold.\nSome clinical research in adults with the common cold shows that taking Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 1.5 mL three times daily reduces symptoms of the common cold and increases the rate of complete resolution after 10 days of treatment, but not after 5 days of treatment, when compared with placebo (81569, 94580). The same product taken at a higher dose of 3 mL three times daily reduces cold symptoms by an additional 10% and has a higher rate of complete resolution after 5 days of treatment. However, this dose is associated with a higher rate of mild to moderate adverse effects (97318). Additionally, a small uncontrolled study shows that this extract is equally effective for reducing common cold symptoms in patients testing positive for human coronavirus infection (not including COVID-19) when compared with other viruses (106648).\n\nMeta-analyses have evaluated the effects of this specific extract in adults with the common cold. One meta-analysis of 5 studies, some unpublished, using Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals)extract 1.5-3 mL three times daily, or tablets 20-40 mg three times daily, for 10 days shows that the mean reduction in a subjective, 40-point, total cold intensity score is 2.3 points at 5 days and 1.2 points at 10 days. Although it is unclear if these decreases are clinically significant, the extract was associated with fewer lost work days, lower acetaminophen consumption, and improved sleep quality when compared with placebo (103604). A separate meta-analysis of five small-to-moderate size studies, some of which were included in the previous meta-analysis, shows that taking Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) in the same formulations and doses reduces cough intensity and increases remission of cough at day 5 when compared with placebo (110015). However, all outcomes in this meta-analysis were patient-reported. Lastly, a network meta-analysis comparing 18 herbal medicines often used for the common cold suggests that Pelargonium sidoides is the most beneficial of those studied for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold (112122). However, it is unclear whether any improvements in cold symptoms are clinically significant.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Pelargonium sidoides extract is beneficial in children with asthma who have an active viral upper respiratory tract infection.\nOne small clinical study in children with mild asthma and an active viral upper respiratory tract infection shows that taking 5-10 drops of a specific extract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) three times daily for 5 days reduces the number of children experiencing asthma attacks by 28% when compared with no treatment.

Additionally, a small open-label study in adults with acute bacterial rhinosinusitus shows that taking this same product in tablet form as 60 mg daily for 10 days reduces the total symptom score, as well as subjective measures of nasal obstruction, facial pain and pressure, impaired sense of smell, mucosal edema, and mucopurulent secretions, when compared with taking amoxicillin 1500 mg daily for 10 days (103605). Additionally, a network meta-analysis comparing 18 herbal medicines often used for acute post-viral rhinosinusitis suggests that Pelargonium sidoides is the most beneficial after cineole for the relief of symptoms (112122).\nless\nTonsillopharyngitis. It is unclear if oral Pelargonium sidoides extract is beneficial in children with tonsillopharyngitis.\nA small clinical study in children aged 6-10 years with acute tonsillopharyngitis shows that taking a specific Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 20 drops three times daily for 7 days reduces symptoms such as sore throat and difficulty swallowing after 4 days of treatment when compared with placebo (14262). A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in children aged 6-10 years old with acute tonsillopharyngitis or acute bronchitis, including the study mentioned above, shows that taking a specific Pelargonium sidoides extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 60-240 drops daily for 6 days reduces the amount of acetaminophen co-medication required to treat fever when compared with placebo (112126).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

In animal models, Pelargonium sidoides root extract does not appear to inhibit coagulation or interact with warfarin (14259, 16648).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAn acetone root extract of Pelargonium sidoides seems to have antibacterial activity against several bacterial pathogens in vitro including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (14259, 14260). A specific Pelargonium sidoides root extract (EPs 7630, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals), has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Hemophilus influenzae (103605). Pelargonium sidoides root extracts also decrease adhesion of bacteria to tissues (16644, 16650, 16652, 81563, 81566). However, the antibacterial activity is considerably less than conventional antibiotics such as penicillin or erythromycin (14260). A root extract also seems to have in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14259). Some isolated constituents of Pelargonium sidoides might also have in vitro activity against other mycobacteria (14263). Extracts of Pelargonium sidoides also seem to have in vitro antiparasitic activity (14261).\nAntiviral effects\nAn aqueous extract of Pelargonium sidoides root appears to have antiviral activity. In vitro, this extract inhibits both herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (16643).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nFor bronchitis and other respiratory disorders, Pelargonium sidoides is thought to have antimicrobial and immunostimulatory effects. Polyphenols in Pelargonium sidoides such as catechin, gallocatechin, gallic acid, and others are thought to stimulate release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin, stimulate interferon activity, and increase natural killer cell activity (14258, 14259, 16646, 81559, 81560, 81561, 81570). Pelargonium sidoides root extracts also increase phagocytosis and decrease adhesion of bacteria to tissues (16650, 16652).\nRespiratory effects\nPelargonium sidoides is thought to have mucolytic effects, which could improve symptoms in respiratory disorders. It improves cilia function in vitro (16641)."

It also contains lignans including sesamine, tannins, inulin, polysaccharides, and trace metals (18, 102133).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlkylamines in pellitory root extracts inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase enzymes, leading to anti-inflammatory effects (102133).\nAntiepileptic effects\nGiving aqueous and methanolic extracts of pellitory root to rats prior to inducing seizures with kainic acid increases the latency time before onset of status epilepticus, and reduces the duration and severity of seizures. Mechanisms include reduction in c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, and in glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of neuroinflammation, in the hippocampus (102133).\nDermatologic effects\nApplication of pellitory to the skin stimulates nerve endings, resulting in redness, irritation, and a burning sensation. The alkylamine pellitorin may be responsible for this irritant effect (18). Pellitory is also reported to have local anesthetic effects (18).\nMale reproductive effects\nTreating male rats with an ethanolic extract of pellitory root for 25 days increases production of sperm cell precursors (spermatogonia), and increases sperm counts, viability, and motility.

The aerial parts of the plant also contain tannins, flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenoids, cyanidins, sesquiterpenes, and glycosides (12, 101478).\nAbortifacient effects\nThe abortifacient effects of pennyroyal might be due to uterine contractions triggered by genitourinary tract irritation (4, 6, 19). The large doses of pennyroyal oil required to produce abortion can cause irreversible kidney damage, hepatic damage, and death (6). A study in pregnant rats suggests that oral administration of pennyroyal extract 250-500 mg/kg from aerial parts for 3 days could disrupt or end pregnancy by affecting blood levels of progesterone and estradiol and inducing changes in uterine and placental tissue (112007).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a rat model of diabetes, an aqueous extract of the aerial parts of pennyroyal administered orally for up to 2 weeks reduced blood sugar levels and improved glucose tolerance (101478).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, the pennyroyal constituents piperitone and piperitenone demonstrate activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, and also against Aspergillus flavus (101476).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn in vitro and animal studies, pennyroyal essential oil has demonstrated antiparasitic effects (108407).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn a rat model of hypertension, an aqueous extract of pennyroyal aerial parts has demonstrated antihypertensive and vasorelaxant effects (108406).\nDermatologic effects\nIn rats with second degree burn injuries, dressings containing pennyroyal leaf extract decrease the burn surface area and increase fibroblast recruitment to a similar extent as petrolatum dressings (101476).\nLiver effects\nPulegone, the main constituent of pennyroyal essential oil, and its metabolite menthofuran, cause severe hepatotoxicity in animals at high doses (12, 650).

Oral peony has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking peony root extract 2250 mg daily, along with Ceylon cinnamon, levant berry, St. John's wort, Tribulus, and licorice, during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle for 3 months reduces the rate of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea by 33% and the time between menstrual cycles by 43 days when compared with lifestyle modification alone. Taking this combination also improves quality of life by about 30% and modestly reduces body weight and body mass index when compared with lifestyle intervention alone. Although taking this combination improved conception rate by 4-fold, live birth rate was similar to lifestyle intervention alone (97216). It is unclear if these effects are due to peony, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there has been interest in using oral peony for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peony for this purpose.\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral peony is beneficial for plaque psoriasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis shows that taking total glucosides of peony (TGP) 600 mg three times daily in conjunction with acitretin for 12 weeks does not improve plaque size or severity when compared with acitretin alone. However, taking TGP in combination with acitretin might increase the number of patients achieving a 50% reduction in plaque size when compared with acitretin alone (97950).\nless\nPsoriatic arthritis. Small, low-quality clinical studies suggest that oral peony, as total glucosides of peony (TGP), may improve symptoms in patients with psoriatic arthritis.\nA meta-analysis of 2 small clinical trials in adults with psoriatic arthritis shows that taking TGP 0.6 grams 3 times daily with conventional medical treatment for 12-24 weeks improves Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores and the inflammatory marker erythrocyte sedimentation rate when compared with conventional treatment alone (112861). The reliability of these findings is limited by the low quality and high heterogeneity of the included studies. Additionally, all of the studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if findings can be applied to other geographical regions and populations.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there has been interest in using oral peony for respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peony for this purpose.\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). Oral peony has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 12 low-quality clinical studies in Chinese patients with RLS shows that taking peony-containing combination herbal preparations along with conventional therapy appears to improve sleep quality and decrease RLS symptoms when compared with conventional therapy alone. A few of the studies included in this analysis also suggest that taking peony-containing herbal products alone might be more effective than conventional therapy for RLS (100991). The peony-containing products included in this analysis contained between 4-15 other herbal ingredients. It is unclear whether the effects are due to peony, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral peony is beneficial in patients with RA; evidence is conflicting.\nAlthough low-quality clinical research in patients with RA has shown that use of total glucosides of peony (TGP) in conjunction with standard treatment for 4-24 weeks reduces inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein when compared with standard treatment alone, effects on RA symptoms are conflicting (92786, 101245, 112861). A pooled analysis of clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking TGP in conjunction with leflunomide for 4-24 weeks is less effective for reducing RA symptom scores than taking leflunomide alone (92786). In contrast, another pooled analysis of clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking TGP for 12-24 weeks in combination with methotrexate improves swollen joint count, but not other symptoms such as morning stiffness and tender joint count, when compared with methotrexate alone. Preliminary subgroup analyses also suggest that taking TGP in conjunction with methotrexate might reduce overall adverse effects when compared with methotrexate alone (101245). Of note, the dose of TGP used is not reported in most trials included in these two analyses. Another meta-analysis of 10 mostly small to moderate-sized clinical trials in adults with RA shows that taking TGP 0.6 grams 1-3 times daily with conventional medical treatment for 12-48 weeks improves symptoms as evaluated with the Disease Activity of 28 joints (DAS28) scale when compared with conventional treatment alone (112861). However, these analyses are all limited by the low quality of the included studies. Additionally, all of the included studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if findings can be applied to other geographical regions and populations.\nless\nSjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral peony is beneficial in patients with Sjogren syndrome.\nSome clinical research in Chinese adults with Sjogren syndrome shows that taking total glucosides of peony (TGP) 600 mg three times daily for 24 weeks improves overall symptoms, with the greatest effects on symptoms of dry eye and fatigue, when compared with placebo (100992). An earlier and smaller clinical study from the same research group found that taking TGP at the same dose and duration improved symptoms of dry mouth, but did not reduce overall symptom scores or other markers of disease, when compared with placebo (97949). However, this study was not adequately powered to detect differences in overall symptom scores between TGP and placebo.\nless\nSpasticity. Although there has been interest in using oral peony for spasticity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peony for this purpose.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Small clinical studies suggest that oral peony, as total glucosides of peony (TGP), may modestly improve disease activity scores in patients with SLE.\nA meta-analysis of 13 small to moderate-sized, low-quality clinical studies in patients with SLE shows that taking TGP 0.6 grams 2-3 times daily or 1.2 grams twice daily for 1-6 months in conjunction with conventional treatment modestly improves the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score when compared with conventional treatment alone. Analyses of secondary endpoints which were not available for all studies show that TGP also improves markers of SLE disease activity, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein, reduces the average daily dose of glucocorticoids and the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide, and decreases the rate of disease recurrence (110432). However, the validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of varying age and disease severity. Additionally, a similar meta-analysis of 8 small to moderate-sized, low-quality clinical studies in adults with SLE shows that taking TGP 0.6 grams 2-3 times daily for 3-12 months in conjunction with conventional treatment of glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants improves SLEDAI scores when compared with conventional treatment alone. TGP also improves markers of inflammation such as ESR, levels of immunoglobulins A, G and M, and complement 3 and 4 (112862). The validity of these finding is also limited by substantial heterogeneity which may be due to differences in conventional therapies. In addition, all of the studies included in these meta-analyses were conducted in China; it is unclear if findings can be applied to other geographical regions and populations.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate peony for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of peony.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of peony are the root, flower, and seed. Peony contains glycosides, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, tannins, terpenoids, triterpenoids, and complex polysaccharides (13538). Specifically, the following constituents have been identified in peony: 2-methoxy-5-(E)-propenyl-phenol-beta-vicianoside (a phenolic glycoside) (68357), 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG) (a gallotannin) (68348, 68350), resveratrol, stilbenes (transresveratrol, cis-epsilon-viniferin, trans-epsilon-viniferin, viniferin, gnetin H, suffruticosol A, suffruticosol B) (68338), paeoniflorin (a bioactive monoterpene glucoside) (68347), paeoniflorgenin (68347), paeoniflorigenone, benzoic acid, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, beta-sitosterol, betulinic acid, catechin, daucosterol, gallic acid, galloylpaeoniflorin, hederagenin, methylgallate, oleanolic acid, oxypaeoniflorin, paeonol, paeonoside, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (92787).\nAnalgesic effects\nSome animal and clinical research suggests that paeoniflorin might have analgesic and neuromuscular blocking effects (13311, 112861).\nAnti-angiogenic effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that the constituent 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG) from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora has anti-angiogenic effects through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding and by blocking proliferation of VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells, growth of immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells, and VEGF-induced capillary-like tube formation of endothelial cells (68350).\nAnti-cancer effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that peony derivates have anti-cancer effects. Resveratrol and its derivatives viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosol B, isolated from peony (Paeonia lactiflora) seeds, have been shown to reduce the viability of human leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner (68346). Some in vitro and animal research suggests that extracts of Paeonia lactiflora slow bladder cancer growth via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (92789). The water-extract of Paeonia radix (PRE) demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the growth of liver cancer cell lines (68339). 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG), a major bioactive constituent of the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. and the root cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr. has been shown to possess potent anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-invasive effects (68344). Six stilbenes (cis-epsilon-viniferin, transresveratrol, trans-epsilon-viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosols A and B) isolated from the seeds of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Paeoniaceae) have also demonstrated cytotoxic and anti-mutagenic effects. The six stilbenes showed cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent manner and were especially potent against mouse glioma cells. Trans-resveratrol showed significant cytotoxic activity against human liver hepatoma and colon cancer cell lines. Trans-epsilon-viniferin, cis-viniferin, and gnetin H exhibited marked cytotoxic activity against human cervix and breast cancer cell lines. Suffruticosol A and B had less cytotoxic effect against all cancer cells except mouse glioma (68338). However, while certain constituents of peony have shown cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell lines, some in vitro research shows that a water extract of peony root increases the proliferation of breast cancer cells (100990).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical, laboratory, and animal research suggests that peony has anti-inflammatory properties (12451, 13311, 68341, 68344, 68349, 68354, 92792, 112861). Total glucosides of peony (TGP) have been shown to reduce the production of prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In vitro research also shows that TGP slows the proliferation of lymphocytes, formation of blood vessels, and production of matrix metalloproteinases (92792). Other in vitro research shows that Paeonia Radix significantly decreases the secretion of MCP-1 and MCP-3 and may reduce nasal inflammation (68349). Paeonia lactiflora has also demonstrated selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity (12451). Mudanpi (MEM), the root cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews (Ranunculaceae) has also been studied in vitro. The methanolic extract of MEM suppresses IL-8 and MCP-1 genes. PGG, a major constituent isolated from MEM, inhibits PMA-induced secretions of IL-8 and MCP-1 proteins by the same mechanism (68341). In other in vitro research, PGG has been shown to possess potent anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-invasive effects (68344). Clinical research in adults with acute pancreatitis shows that rectal administration of a coloclyster containing 15 grams of red peony root reduces white blood cell count and plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) when compared with a placebo enema (104283). Clinical research in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or various types of inflammatory arthritis also shows that TGP reduces inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, and IL-6 (112861, 112862).\nAnti-lipidemic effects\nSome preliminary animal research suggests that paeoniflorin might have anti-lipidemic effects (13554).\nAnti-proliferative effects\nIn vitro research shows that 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG), a constituent from the root of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., exhibits a growth-inhibiting effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (68336). PGG exerted this growth-inhibitory effect by causing a G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and suppressing the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B. Cells treated with PGG displayed neither apoptosis nor necrosis. It has been suggested that PGG may be a candidate for the development of a low-toxic anticancer agent.\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research suggests that paeoniflorin might have anti-hyperglycemic effects (13311).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome peony extracts appear to have antibacterial and antifungal activity (13556). Some in vitro research suggests that the peony constituents paeonol, benzoic acid, methylgallate, and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG) have bactericidal and growth-inhibiting activity against Helicobacter pylori strains resistant to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline (92788).\nAntioxidant effects\nPeony might also have antioxidant activity (13543, 13544). In vitro research suggests that resveratrol derivatives isolated from the seeds of Paeonia lactiflora have antioxidant effects (68346). Resveratrol and its dimer and trimer derivatives (viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosol B) were shown to reduce the viability of human leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Human leukemia cells treated with the four resveratrol derivatives exhibited the morphological changes typical of cell apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, apoptotic bodies, and DNA fragmentations. A time-dependent histogram of the cellular DNA analyzed by flow cytometry revealed a rapid increase in sub-diploid cells. A concomitant decrease in diploid cells was observed in cells exposed to resveratrol for 0-24 hours. Treatment with resveratrol, viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosol B resulted in an increase in sub-G1 population by 51, 5, 11 and 59%, respectively, after 24 hours. Treatment with resveratrol produced a concentration-dependent decrease in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 mRNA levels after five hours. In addition, CYP1B1 gene expression was suppressed by suffruticosol B. These results demonstrated that resveratrol oligomers also strongly suppressed human leukemia cell proliferation and induced DNA damage in vitro. CYP1B1 gene suppression may play a role in this resveratrol-induced apoptosis.\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. has antiviral effects. The ethyl acetate fraction showed anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity. The constituent 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG) was isolated from the crude drug and identified as the active anti-HBV principle. PGG decreased the level of extracellular HBV in a dose-dependent manner and also reduced the HBsAg level by 25% (68356). Other in vitro research shows that the methanolic extract of Paeonia suffruticosa prevents the process of herpes simplex virus (HSV) attachment and penetration and the aqueous extract of P. suffruticosa inhibits HSV attachment to the cell surface (68337). Additional in vitro research shows that the methanol extract of Paeonia suffruticosa has potent anti-HIV-1 integrase activity, suggesting that it is a rich source of anti-HIV compounds (68334).\nCognitive effects\nThere is interest in using peony to improve memory. Some animal research suggests it can improve memory in scopolamine-induced memory disruption and other models (13311, 13542).\nDNA protective effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that partially purified paeoniflorin (PF), a cosmetic ingredient with paeoniflorin content of about 64% derived from the root of Paeonia lactiflora, protects against DNA damage induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in both cultured normal human keratinocytes and hairless mouse skin keratinocytes (68356).\nEstrogenic effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that a water extract of peony root has estrogenic activity by increasing the production of estrogen, up-regulating estrogen receptors in reproductive tissue, and interacting with estrogen receptors in the estrogen receptor-estrogen response element-dependent pathway (100990).\nHematologic effects\nPreliminary research suggests peony might have antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and antithrombotic effects. Peony contains a glycopeptide that is structurally similar to heparin. Some in vitro research suggests that the following compounds isolated from peony may be responsible for its antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects: paeonol, paeoniflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, and benzoyloxypaeoniflorin (92787). In a rat model of stroke, paeoniflorin seems to limit infarct size (13539).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests peony might have hepatoprotective effects. In addition to its antioxidant activity, peony also seems to prevent fibrosis by inhibiting collagen synthesis (13544, 13545, 13546).\nImmunologic effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that gallotannin penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG), a constituent from the root cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., has immunologic effects. Specifically, PGG appears to inhibit interleukin (IL)-8 gene expression and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation (68348). Some clinical and animal research suggests that total glucosides of peony have a role in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus as suggested by improvements in symptoms and the levels of immunoglobulins A, G and M, complement 3 and 4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6 (92785, 92786, 92791, 112861, 112862).\nNeuroprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that peony root extract exhibits neuroprotective activity and prevents experimentally induced brain neuron spike discharges in rats. Researchers attribute neuroprotection to the gallotannin and paeoniflorin constituents (3818).\nSpasmolytic effects\nPreliminary in vitro research suggests peony might have spasmolytic activity. Alone or with licorice root, peony seems to inhibit the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors (13541).\nVasodilatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG), isolated from the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa, has vasorelaxant and anti-inflammatory effects. PGG appears to induce a concentration-dependent relaxation of the phenylephrine-precontracted rat aorta, which disappears with the removal of functional endothelium. When incubated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or carotid arteries isolated from rats, PGG increases the production of cGMP in a dose-dependent manner. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, PGG treatment attenuates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 translocation. In addition, PGG suppresses the expression levels of adhesion molecules induced by TNF-alpha and attenuates TNF-alpha-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Finally, PGG treatment inhibits cellular adhesion of U937 cells onto human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by TNF-alpha. These results may suggest that PGG dilates vascular smooth muscle and suppresses the vascular inflammatory process via endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling (68354)."

Orally, peppermint leaf seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, anal burning, belching, diarrhea, dry mouth, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nTopically: Burning, dermatitis, irritation, and redness.\nDermatologic\nTopically, peppermint oil can cause skin irritation, burning, erythema, and contact dermatitis (3802, 11781, 31528, 43338, 68473, 68457, 68509, 96361, 96362). Also, a case of severe mucosal injury has been reported for a patient who misused an undiluted over the counter mouthwash that contained peppermint and arnica oil in 70% alcohol (19106).\n\nIn large amounts, peppermint oil may cause chemical burns when used topically or orally. A case of multiple burns in the oral cavity and pharynx, along with edema of the lips, tongue, uvula, and soft palate, has been reported for a 49-year-old female who ingested 40 drops of pure peppermint oil. Following treatment with intravenous steroids and antibiotics, the patient's symptoms resolved over the course of 2 weeks (68432). Also, a case of chemical burns on the skin and skin necrosis has been reported for a 35-year-old male who spilled undiluted peppermint oil on a previous skin graft (68572). Oral peppermint oil has also been associated with burning mouth syndrome and chronic mouth ulceration in people with contact sensitivity to peppermint (6743). Also, excessive consumption of mint candies containing peppermint oil has been linked to cases of stomatitis (13114).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, peppermint oil can cause heartburn, nausea and vomiting, anal or perianal burning, abdominal pain, belching, dry mouth, diarrhea, and increased appetite (3803, 6740, 6741, 6742, 10075, 11779, 11789, 17682, 68497, 68514)(68532, 68544, 96344, 96360, 102602, 107955). Enteric-coated capsules might help to reduce the incidence of heartburn (3802, 4469, 6740, 11777). However, in one clinical study, a specific enteric-coated formulation of peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) taken as 180 mg three times daily was associated with a higher rate of adverse effects when compared with placebo (48% versus 31%, respectively). Specifically, of the patients consuming this product, 11% experienced belching and 26% experienced heartburn, compared to 2% and 12%, respectively, in the placebo group (107955). A meta-analysis of eight small clinical studies in patients with irritable bowel syndrome shows that taking enteric-coated formulations of peppermint oil increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms by 67% when compared with a control group (109980). Enteric-coated capsules can also cause anal burning in people with reduced bowel transit time (11782, 11789).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, a sensitive urethra has been reported rarely (102602).\nless\nHepatic\nOne case of hepatocellular liver injury has been reported following the oral use of peppermint. Symptoms included elevated liver enzymes, fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, and signs of hypersensitivity. Details on the dosage and type of peppermint consumed were unavailable (96358).\nless\nImmunologic\nOne case of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, characterized by sudden onset of lip and tongue swelling, tightness of throat, and shortness of breath, has been reported in a 69-year-old male who consumed peppermint candy (89479). An allergic reaction after use of peppermint oil in combination with caraway oil has been reported in a patient with a history of bronchial asthma (96344). It is not clear if this reaction occurred in response to the peppermint or caraway components.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, headache has been reported rarely (102602).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, peppermint has been reported to cause blurry vision (3803).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral enteric-coated peppermint oil is conditionally recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) for the relief of global IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain.\nThe ACG conditionally recommends the use of peppermint for the relief of global IBS symptoms. This recommendation is based on an available meta-analysis of generally low-quality clinical research (105124). Several clinical trials and meta-analyses show that taking enteric-coated peppermint oil 1-2 capsules orally two to four times daily reduces abdominal pain, distention, flatulence, and bowel movements in patients with IBS. Each capsule provides approximately 0.2 mL of peppermint oil or 180-225 mg peppermint oil. Most trials have used specific products (Colpermin, Tillotts Pharma; Mintoil, Cadigroup; Ibgard, IM HealthScience, Tempocol) (3802, 3803, 4469, 11778, 11779, 17681, 17682, 68467, 68515, 68522)(68603, 68604, 68605, 96360, 99493, 109980). The most recent meta-analysis to date shows that four patients would need to take peppermint oil to prevent one patient from having persistent IBS symptoms, and seven patients would need to take peppermint oil to prevent one patient from having abdominal pain. However, the individual studies included in the analysis lasted no more than 12 weeks (109980); any long-term effects are unclear.\n\nAlthough most studies have shown benefit for reducing symptoms, some older studies have found no significant effect (11777, 11789) or only short-term benefits (68620). Also, a well-designed study shows that taking peppermint oil capsules designed for either small intestinal release (enteric-coated) or ileocolonic release does not increase the number of people with at least a 30% decrease in abdominal pain over a period of 4 weeks, although symptoms are modestly reduced when compared with placebo (102602). Another clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe IBS shows that taking a specific enteric-coated formulation of peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) 180 mg three times daily for 6 weeks does not further improve symptom severity when compared with placebo. However, both groups experienced a large improvement on the IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and the IBS Global Improvement Scale (107955). The validity of these findings is limited due to lost data and inconsistent follow-up; additionally, adverse effects occurred more frequently in the peppermint oil group. The reasons for these negative findings are unclear but may include short treatment durations and the use of different formulations; additionally, IBS is comprised of various subtypes and symptoms that can range in severity and presentation, which may alter treatment response.\n\nSome clinical research has also evaluated a specific combination product (Atrantil, KBS Research) containing peppermint leaf, red quebracho extract, and conker tree extract. Taking this product as needed for 2 weeks seems to reduce constipation and bloating when compared to baseline in patients with constipation-predominant IBS (95429, 95430). It is unclear if the effects of this product are due to peppermint, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBarium enema-related colonic spasm. Rectal peppermint, as part of barium enema preparations, seems to reduce colonic spasms during examination. Oral peppermint also seems to be beneficial.\nRectal use of peppermint oil, added as an ingredient in barium enema preparations, seems to relax the colon during barium enema examination and reduce the percentage of patients who experience colonic spasms by about 25% to 30% (6739, 6749, 12009). Adding peppermint oil to the barium enema seems to be at least as effective as using systemic scopolamine (Buscopan). Adding peppermint oil to the barium solution also does not seem to impair image quality (12009).\n\nSome clinical research also shows that taking peppermint oil orally before the start of a double-contrast barium enema examination decreases spasms and might also increase diagnostic quality (14467).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Oral and inhaled peppermint seem to reduce nausea and vomiting in patients with CINV.\nClinical research shows that adding peppermint oil, 40 drops in 20 mL water, every 8 hours following chemotherapy treatment to treatment with standard antiemetics reduces the severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia by moderate to large amounts over 48 hours when compared with a plain water placebo (105123). The use of peppermint oil aromatherapy has also been investigated. Clinical research shows that adding 2 drops of peppermint oil to a cool, damp washcloth for use on the neck as aromatherapy for about 30 minutes helps relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea by a small amount when compared with a washcloth without peppermint oil (102603). Additional clinical research in patients receiving standard antiemetics after chemotherapy shows that applying one drop of peppermint oil below the nose three times daily for 5 days reduces the severity of nausea and the frequency of nausea, vomiting, and retching by a moderate to large amount when compared with the antiemetics alone. These parameters were not improved following treatment with cisplatin (105122). A meta-analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials in adults receiving chemotherapy also shows that peppermint oil aromatherapy moderately improves nausea and vomiting when compared with control. However, the results of this analysis are limited by heterogenous application methods, doses, and durations of peppermint therapy (114761).\n\nIn children with acute leukemia, a small clinical study shows that aromatherapy with 2 drops of peppermint oil and 3 drops of lemon oil in 80 mL of water diffused 30 minutes prior to and 2 and 4 hours after chemotherapy once weekly for 4 weeks decreases the severity of nausea, vomiting, and retching, and improves quality of life scores when compared with diffused water or no intervention (112015). The validity of these findings is limited by the use of patient-reported outcomes. Another small clinical trial in children receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia shows that aromatherapy with peppermint oil 2%, 0.2 mL inhaled over 3 minutes immediately prior to 3 consecutive chemotherapy sessions, added to standard care (e.g. antiemetic medications), reduces overall incidence of nausea by 40%, and improves nausea and vomiting severity scores, when compared with no additional interventions. These results were similar to those receiving Swedish massage prior to chemotherapy sessions (114759).\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral peppermint, in combination with caraway and possibly other ingredients, seems to reduce symptoms of dyspepsia. It is unclear if oral peppermint alone is beneficial.\nSome clinical research shows that taking specific products containing peppermint and caraway oil (Enteroplant, Dr Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals; Menthacarin, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.) improves quality of life and reduces symptoms of dyspepsia, including feelings of fullness, pain, and mild gastrointestinal spasms (6740, 6741, 10075, 96344, 102600). A meta-analysis of three of these clinical studies shows that taking this combination product 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces abdominal pain when compared with placebo (110091). Taking this combination twice daily for 4 weeks also improves postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome, two subtypes of dyspepsia, when compared with placebo (96344). The combination of enteric-coated peppermint oil 90 mg and caraway oil 50 mg appears to be comparable to cisapride for relieving dyspepsia when taken 2-3 times daily for up to 4 weeks (6740, 6741, 10075). However, most trials investigating this combination are small and/or of overall low quality (102600).\n\nA specific combination product containing peppermint leaf (Iberogast, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH) also seems to improve symptoms of dyspepsia. The combination includes peppermint leaf plus clown's mustard plant, German chamomile, caraway, licorice, milk thistle, angelica, celandine, and lemon balm (7049). A meta-analysis of studies using this combination product shows that taking 1 mL orally three times daily over a period of 4 weeks reduces the severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo (13089). A similar combination product containing extracts from peppermint leaf, clown's mustard plant, German chamomile flower, caraway, licorice root, and lemon balm (STW 5-II, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH) 1 mL taken three times daily for up to 8 weeks eliminates gastrointestinal symptoms in 40% more dyspepsia patients when compared with placebo (12724).\nless\nEndoscopy-associated adverse effects. Intraluminal peppermint seems to reduce spasticity during an endoscopy. It is unclear if oral peppermint is beneficial for reducing adverse effects related to endoscopy.\nA meta-analysis of four clinical trials show that peppermint oil, administered orally or intraluminally, reduces the incidence of spasticity by about 41% when compared with placebo in patients undergoing endoscopy, with severe spasticity occurring at about 30% the rate of those taking placebo. However, there was no effect on subjective pain (102604). Individual clinical studies show that intraluminal peppermint oil can reduce both pain and spams in patients undergoing endoscopy (18220, 68371, 68395, 68445, 68532). However, there are limitations with this form of administration, including cost and practicality, which has led to interest in the use of oral formulations (104221). Studies evaluating oral extended-release peppermint have been conflicting. While one study shows that a specific extended-release peppermint oil product (Colpermin) 187 mg or 0.2 mL taken orally 4 hours prior to a colonoscopy reduces procedure time, pain, and spasticity (68532), a study using another specific extended-release peppermint oil (IBGard) did not show an effect on colonic spasms, procedure time, or adenoma detection rate when compared with placebo (104221). These differing outcomes may be due to timing of administration. The study that showed benefit administered the treatment 4 hours prior to endoscopy, whereas the study showing no benefit administered the treatment only 1 hour prior. This suggests that extended-release peppermint may need to be administered at least 4 hours prior to the procedure to allow for adequate colonic release (68532, 102604, 104221).\nless\nNipple fissures. Topical peppermint seems to reduce cracked skin and pain in the nipples due to breastfeeding.\nClinical research shows that topical application of peppermint oil in gel or water reduces cracked skin and pain in the nipple area from breastfeeding when compared with using placebo, lanolin, or the expressed breast milk technique (68454, 68462). Other research shows that applying peppermint oil in cream immediately after breastfeeding for 2 weeks decreases pain and trauma in the nipple area similarly to the topical application of dexpanthenol or lanolin (96365).\nless\nPressure ulcers. Topical peppermint seems to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers.\nClinical research in bedridden patients shows that prophylactic application of a topical gel containing peppermint oil 0.2% three times daily for up to 14 days results in pressure injuries in about 23% of patients compared with 77% of those given a placebo gel (102605).\nless\nTension headache. Topical peppermint seems to relieve tension headaches.\nClinical research shows that topical application of peppermint oil 10% relieves tension headaches when compared with placebo (3801, 6190).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbdominal pain. Although there has been interest in using oral peppermint for abdominal pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nAnxiety. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for reducing anxiety.\nA clinical trial in patients presenting to the emergency department for an acute coronary syndrome event shows that placing 3 drops of peppermint oil on a cotton ball and inhaling for 1 hour improves anxiety and respiratory rate when compared with baseline or placebo (107958). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of repeated inhalation of peppermint oil are unclear.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral peppermint oil is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in trained adult runners shows that taking peppermint essential oil, 0.05 mL diluted in 500 mL of water, orally once 30 minutes before exercise improves running time to exhaustion by 11% when compared with placebo (112742). Another very small clinical study in elite soccer athletes shows that use of a specific peppermint essential oil (doTERRA), 1 drop rubbed into hands and inhaled with 5 deep breaths, does not improve jump performance metrics when compared with placebo (114760).\nless\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. It is unclear if topical peppermint is beneficial for reducing hot flashes in patients with breast cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a spray containing a combination of peppermint and neroli hydrolat does not alleviate hot flashes in most patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer when compared with using a plain water spray (68481).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that inhalation of peppermint oil slightly improves memory and the performance of cognitive tasks such as typing, alphabetization, and ordering, but not attention and speed of task completion, when compared with control (56954, 68416, 68466).\nless\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral, topical, or inhaled peppermint for the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nDental plaque. Topical peppermint has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that rinsing the mouth for one minute with 10 mL of a specific combination product (HiOra, Himalaya Herbal Healthcare) containing peppermint oil and numerous other ingredients twice daily for two days reduces plaque index or plaque area when compared with placebo; however, it was not as effective as chlorhexidine 0.2% solution (68530). It is unclear if these effects are due to peppermint oil, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiffuse esophageal spasm. It is unclear if oral peppermint oil is beneficial for diffuse esophageal spasm.\nA small exploratory study in adults with diffuse esophageal spasm shows that drinking a solution of peppermint oil, 5 drops in 10 mL of water, can resolve esophageal contractions when compared with baseline (13415). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral peppermint oil is beneficial for reducing menstrual pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking three capsules of peppermint oil (Colpermin; Tillotts Company or Razak company) daily for 3 days, starting on the first day of menstruation, is as effective as mefenamic acid 250 mg three times daily for reducing pain, and more effective for reducing nausea and vomiting, associated with dysmenorrhea. However, mefenamic acid was more effective for reducing bleeding and analgesic use (105125).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil improves fatigue in patients with cardiac disease.\nA clinical trial in hospitalized patients with various forms of cardiac disease shows that placing 3 drops of peppermint oil on a cotton ball and inhaling for 20 minutes nightly for 7 days improves fatigue scores when compared with placebo. These improvements were similar to those seen with lavender oil inhalation. Fatigue scores decreased by 24 and 21 points in the peppermint and lavender groups, respectively, compared with a 2-point reduction in the placebo group (107959). The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment.\nless\nHalitosis. Peppermint has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients as a mouthwash; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that rinsing the mouth with a specific combination of tea tree oil, peppermint, and lemon essential oil once for three minutes improves breath smell when compared with placebo or benzydamine hydrochloride (19177). Other preliminary clinical research in elderly adults with dementia who require oral care assistance shows that cleaning the mouth with a mixture of peppermint oil, tea tree oil, and lemon essential oils diluted to 0.5%, applied via gauze, twice daily for 7 days improves halitosis scores and oral condition scores when compared with placebo (112957).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for insomnia.\nPreliminary clinical research in cancer patients shows that receiving aromatherapy as three drops of peppermint oil applied to a cotton ball and attached to the collar for 20 minutes at bedtime for one week improves sleep when compared with baseline. However, it seems to be no better than using lavender oil aromatherapy or using a control of lavender oil 1% (103063).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with menopausal symptoms shows that receiving aromatherapy as 2 drops of peppermint oil with upper extremity massage and for 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks moderately improves menopause symptom scores, including both somatic symptoms and urogenital symptoms, when compared with placebo (112745).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if intranasal or inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for migraine headache.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using 1-2 doses of intranasal peppermint oil 1.5% (Poursina Company) at the start of migraine pain is as effective as intranasal lidocaine 4%, and more effective than placebo, for reducing migraine headache intensity. Approximately 42% of those using peppermint oil indicated a high level of headache reduction, compared with 42% of those using lidocaine and 5% of those using placebo. Also, pain relief was felt within 5 minutes in more patients using peppermint than placebo (105126). However, it is unclear if participants were truly blinded to the use of peppermint oil. Other preliminary clinical research in pediatric patients with migraine or other chronic headaches shows that receiving aromatherapy with peppermint oil over 10 minutes during a footbath does not improve pain or anxiety scores when compared with control (112746).\nless\nMosquito repellent. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil as a mosquito repellent, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this purpose.\nMyalgia. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil for myalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nOral mucositis. Topical peppermint has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults undergoing stem cell transplantation shows that using an oral rinse containing peppermint oil and German chamomile three times daily, in addition to standard treatment with sodium chloride and chlorhexidine, reduces the duration and severity of mucositis and the use of narcotic analgesics when compared with placebo and standard treatment. However, this oral rinse does not reduce or delay the occurrence of mucositis or affect the duration of hospitalization (96363). Another small clinical study in adults with head and neck cancers undergoing radiation shows that rinsing with 5 mL of a polyherbal mouthwash containing peppermint oil, German chamomile, aloe vera, and honey for 1 minute 3 times daily for 6 weeks reduces oral mucositis incidence, severity, and pain when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% and placebo (111291). Clinical research in adults receiving treatment with 5-fluorouracil shows that using an oral rinse containing peppermint, sage tea, and thyme in addition to basic oral care, starting on the first day of chemotherapy and continuing for 14 days, delays the onset of mucositis, but not the rate or severity of mucositis, when compared with basic oral care alone (96364). It is unclear if these effects are due to peppermint oil, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nPain (acute). It is unclear if inhaled or topical peppermint oil is beneficial for acute pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in cardiac patients shows that peppermint oil aromatherapy reduces pain associated with intravenous catheterization by a small amount when compared with a distilled water control (102601). Another small open-label study in adults undergoing venipuncture for dialysis shows that topical application of peppermint gel 5 mL reduces pain scores by approximately 50% when compared with no intervention. These results were similar to using a cold compress (114758). Additionally, a small open-label study in children undergoing a dental procedure, shows that topical application of peppermint oil 0.2% , moderately improves pain scores after a buccal injection when compared with lidocaine spray 15% (114757).\nless\nPostherpetic neuralgia. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil for postherpetic neuralgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nPostoperative ileus. It is unclear if oral peppermint oil is beneficial for the prevention of postoperative ileus.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific peppermint oil product (Colpermin, Tillotts Pharma) as two capsules three times daily for 5 days after routine gynecological surgery does not prevent postoperative abdominal distension and dyspepsia when compared with placebo (68602). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients undergoing elective cesarean section shows that taking 20 drops of peppermint oil 4 hours after surgery and then hourly for a total of three doses reduces the time to first bowel sounds by around 3.3 hours, first flatulence by 4.4 hours, and first stool by 5 hours when compared with placebo (110092).\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that inhaled peppermint may be beneficial for PONV. However, it is unclear if the benefit is due to aromatherapy or improved breathing patterns.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that using peppermint aromatherapy helps relieve postoperative nausea (3804, 13415, 68524, 104219, 104220, 115149). Inhaling peppermint oil 10% and 30% as aromatherapy reduces the severity of nausea when compared with placebo, with no significant difference between concentrations (104219). However, one small clinical trial shows improvement in PONV only within the first 4 hours after surgery, with a diminishing effect beyond 4 hours (104220). Other preliminary clinical research shows that peppermint oil aromatherapy is no more effective for reducing postoperative nausea than inhaling isopropyl alcohol or saline (13416, 68529). It is possible that any relief of postoperative nausea observed with peppermint aromatherapy results from improved breathing patterns after surgery rather than peppermint oil itself (13416, 90512). One small study shows that inhaling peppermint oil while practicing controlled breathing does not appear to relieve PONV better than practicing controlled breathing alone (90512).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that inhaling vapors from a mixture of peppermint, ginger, spearmint, and cardamom essential oils reduces symptoms of postoperative nausea in approximately 15% more patients when compared with inhaling ginger essential oils alone, and in approximately 43% more patients when compared with inhaling saline (89888). However, it is not clear if the effect is due to peppermint, the other oils, or the combination. In contrast, a small clinical trial in adults undergoing port catheter placement shows that application of a specific aromatherapy patch containing peppermint and lavender (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Medical) preoperatively does not reduce PONV rescue treatment when compared with placebo (114623). Another small clinical trial in adults with anxiety undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty shows that application of the same patch containing peppermint and lavender every 12 hours for 6 doses does not reduce overall PONV when compared with placebo (114622).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for postoperative pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart cardiac surgery shows that receiving aromatherapy with peppermint oil 10%, 0.1 mL, three times daily for 7 doses moderately improves pain scores when compared with placebo (112747). Other preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing lumbar discectomy surgery shows that receiving aromatherapy with peppermint oil 5 drops once postoperatively modestly improves pain scores and anxiety scores when compared with no intervention (112744). A small clinical trial in adults undergoing port catheter placement shows that application of a specific aromatherapy patch containing peppermint and lavender (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Medical) preoperatively does not improve pain scores or reduce opioid rescue treatment in the immediate post-operative period when compared with placebo (114623). Another small clinical trial in adults with anxiety undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty shows that application of the same patch containing peppermint and lavender every 12 hours for 6 doses modestly reduceses opioid consumption on postoperative day 2, but not day 1, 7, or 30, when compared with placebo (114622). However, these changes are unlikely to be clinically relevant. In addition, it is unclear if any potential effects are due to peppermint, lavender, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Inhaled peppermint has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults undergoing port catheter placement shows that application of a specific aromatherapy patch containing peppermint and lavender (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Medical) preoperatively does not shorten postoperative length of stay when compared with placebo (114623).\nless\nPostoperative sleep disturbance. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for postoperative sleep disturbance.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart cardiac surgery shows that receiving aromatherapy with peppermint oil 10%, 0.1 mL, three times daily for 7 doses modestly improves sleep scores when compared with placebo (112747).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Inhaled peppermint oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that aromatherapy with a mixture of 5% lemon and 5% peppermint essential oils modestly reduces the intensity of nausea and vomiting on days 2-4, but not day 1, when compared with placebo aromatherapy. When nauseated, patients placed three drops of the essential oil mixture (Barij Essence Co.) onto a cotton ball held 3 cm from the nose. This action could be repeated after 5 minutes if needed (105121).\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for reducing anxiety prior to a medical procedure.\nPreliminary clinical research in cardiac patients shows that peppermint oil aromatherapy does not reduce anxiety associated with intravenous catheterization when compared with a distilled water control (102601).\nless\nPruritus. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that topical peppermint oil improves itching of various etiologies.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with renal, hepatic, or diabetic pruritus shows that topical application of peppermint oil 5% in petrolatum twice daily for 2 weeks improves symptoms of pruritus when compared with petrolatum alone (96361). Preliminary clinical research in patients with severe or intractable pruritus secondary to burn scars shows that applying a specific product (Chongqing No.1, CQ-01, MJ Medical Gel Systems Ltd.) containing peppermint oil 3.6%, menthol 1.4%, and methyl salicylate 2.5%, covered with gauze for 24 hours, reduces the severity of pruritus for up to 7 days after application when compared with hydrogel covered with gauze or with gauze alone (96362). Preliminary clinical research in females experiencing itchy skin due to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy also shows that applying peppermint oil 0.5% in sesame oil twice daily for 2 weeks reduces pruritus severity approximately 1.8-fold when compared with sesame oil alone (89478).\nless\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Although there has been interest in using oral peppermint for SIBO, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if inhaled peppermint oil is beneficial for stress.\nClinical research shows that peppermint aromatherapy decreases physical and perceived levels of stress when compared with baseline (68422, 68517). A small clinical study in adults undergoing a virtual reality (VR) driving scenario to test road rage shows that exposure to peppermint oil (Pure Essential Oil of Peppermint, Tisserand Aromatherapy) 5 drops via fan diffuser improves aggressive driving behavior scores but does not seem to improve self-reported stress, aggression, alertness, happiness, or calmness when compared with controls that did not receive aromatherapy during the VR session (112017).\nless\nToothache. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil for toothache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nUrticaria. Although there has been interest in using topical peppermint oil for urticaria, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of peppermint for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate peppermint for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPeppermint oil has most often been used as 5-40 drops, either as a single dose or every 8 hours for up to 48 hours, or in doses of 270-1350 mg daily for up to 4 weeks.

Peppermint oil containing pugelone concentrations below 1% is considered safe (13413).\nTopical:\nPeppermint oil has been used in various topical formulations, including as a gel, cream, rinse, or oil or water mixture. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nInhalational/Aromatherapy:Various concentrations of peppermint oil have been placed in water, below the nose on the skin, or on a cotton ball or washcloth.

Peppermint oil is a complex mixture of compounds, including 35% to 70% menthol, 15% to 30% menthone, 4% to 14% menthyl acetate (13413). Pharmaceutical grade peppermint oil is typically standardized to contain at least 44% menthol.\n\nPeppermint oil also contains 1% to 4% pugelone, a neuro- and hepatotoxin. Peppermint oil prepared with young leaves of peppermint contains higher concentrations of pugelone than peppermint oil prepared with mature leaves. Concentrations of pugelone below 1% are considered safe. While there are methods to reduce the pugelone content, it is not clear if all peppermint oil manufacturers use these methods (13413).\n\nOne product evaluated in clinical studies (IBgard, IM HealthScience) is specially formulated to target release in the small intestine. This product is a triple-coated microsphere bead containing purified peppermint oil which releases over 4 hours in the small intestine. The outer core of the capsule facilitates transit through the stomach, the middle core is insoluble at gastric pH but dissolves in intestinal pH, and the inner core surrounds the peppermint, which is provided in solid state terpenes. Each capsule contains peppermint oil 90 mg with 41.5 mg of free L-menthol (96360, 104221).\n\nA commercially available product containing peppermint oil 90 mg and caraway oil 50 mg (Menthacarin, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG), is designed to release its active contents in the duodenum (96344).",

            "Interactions with Supplements": "IRON\nConcomitant use of peppermint with iron seems to inhibit iron absorption.\nPeppermint tea dose-dependently inhibited iron absorption in both animal and human research (19337, 21711).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "DIARRHEA\nPeppermint oil can cause irritation and burning, which might cause anal burning in patients with increased gastrointestinal motility. There is at least one case report of anal burning in a patient with severe diarrhea who was taking enteric-coated peppermint oil. Insufficient absorption of the menthol in peppermint oil may cause high concentrations of menthol in anal mucosa and cause anal burning (11782). Avoid use of peppermint oil in patients with diarrhea.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation of overdose with oral peppermint. Intravenously, peppermint oil has been reported to cause one case of pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. These effects were presumably due to direct toxicity and a resultant increase in pulmonary vascular permeability (68431).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with peppermint.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMenthol and other peppermint oil constituents are rapidly absorbed in the proximal intestine after oral administration (11780, 18220). A specific, enteric-coated peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) formulated for delayed-release exhibits a linear pharmacokinetic profile when taken in doses of 180-540 mg, with a direct and proportional increase in systemic exposure with increasing dose. However, when adjusted for weight, no dose-dependent changes in peak plasma menthol concentrations, time to peak concentration, and total systemic exposure were identified. Mean maximum plasma concentrations were 1195 ng/mL, 2470 ng/mL, and 4040 ng/mL for 180 mg, 360 mg, and 540 mg doses, respectively (107957). In healthy males, the mean maximum plasma concentration of menthol following ingestion of a combination of caraway oil 100 mg and peppermint oil 180 mg was found to be greater for an immediate release vs. enteric-coated formulation (1492 ng/mL vs. 1196 ng/mL, respectively) (68377). In human research, a single dose of oral peppermint spray was rapidly absorbed into the gastric mucosa, and peak concentrations were reported within one hour (68519).\nMetabolism\nFor peppermint oil to exert effects on the lower intestine, it must pass through the upper gastrointestinal tract unmetabolized. Enteric coated peppermint oil formulations prevent upper gastrointestinal tract metabolism and instead promote metabolism in the distal small intestines and ascending colon (11780, 68618). The primary biliary metabolite of the peppermint constituent menthol is menthol glucuronide (11780, 18220, 68366), while urinary metabolites, which form via hydroxylation at the C-7, C-8, and C-9 positions, include mono- and dihydroxymenthols and carboxylic acid (68429). L-menthol is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 isomer CYP2A6 to inactive metabolites (104221, 107957).\nExcretion\nThe menthol metabolite menthol glucuronide is excreted in the urine (11776, 11780, 18220, 68519, 68536, 107957), while a sulfate derivative is excreted in bile (68429). The elimination half-life for a specific enteric-coated peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) 180 mg, 360 mg, and 540 mg is 2.1, 3.5, and 4.6 hours, respectively (107957).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of peppermint are the aerial parts and oil. Peppermint oil is obtained by distilling the aerial parts of peppermint (89480). The leaves of the peppermint plant have been found to contain 1.2% to 3.9% essential oil (68402, 68435, 68495, 96359). Peppermint oil is a complex mixture of compounds, including 30% to 70% menthol, 15% to 30% menthone, 4% to 32% menthyl acetate, and 1% to 4% pulegone (13413, 54805, 58102, 68483, 68502, 96359, 96360, 96363). The oil also contains menthofuran, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), carvone, various flavonoids, phenolic acids, and triterpenes (96363, 96359). Terpenes can vary with growing conditions and time of harvest (96360). Peppermint leaf and oil also contain acetaldehyde, amyl alcohol, menthyl esters, limone, pinene, phellandrene, cadinene, and dimethyl sulfide. Trace constituents include alpha-pinene, sabinene, terpinolene, ocimene, gamma-terpinene, fenchene, alpha- and beta-thujone, citronellol, and other compounds (12730, 13413, 68404, 68414, 68428, 68468, 68479, 68483, 68502, 96363)(96359). Peppermint tea contains rosmarinic acid, diosmin, and catechin (96359).\nAnalgesic effects\nFor pain in myalgias and neuralgias, menthol in topical peppermint oil is thought to have a direct inhibitory effect on the sensitized pain receptors. It might also act centrally to alter pain perception (11781). Menthol has been shown to inhibit voltage-dependent sodium channels, which may contribute to the antinociceptive and local anesthetic effects of menthol (68389).\n\nTopically, peppermint may activate A-delta fibers and kappa-opioid receptors to reduce the sensation of itching (96361).\n\nPeppermint oil aromatherapy may treat chronic pain by enhancing the parasympathetic response through the effects of touch and smell, resulting in relaxation (7107).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPeppermint has been found to have a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in xylene-induced ear edema experiments in mice, which suggested as attributable to its volatile oil, flavonoid, and resin content (41164). In human research, a mixture of naturally-occurring plant oils, containing peppermint, exhibited marked anti-inflammatory activity in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory system (30719).\nAntibacterial effects\nPeppermint oil has antibacterial activity in vitro (13413, 13414). In vitro research suggests that peppermint oil has antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Micrococcus flavus ATTC 10,240, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 0425 delta/1 and 0425 52C strains, with synergistic antimicrobial effects when simultaneously applied with oxytetracycline (39809, 39812, 43544, 46879, 47789, 49447, 58102, 59685, 68393, 68399)(68441, 68489, 68505).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that peppermint oil can revert tumor cells back to a differentiated state (41170).\nAntifungal activity\nThe menthol constituent of peppermint is active against fungal microorganisms that cause onychomycosis such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Epidermophyton stockdale (13447, 43476, 68546). Other in vitro research suggests that peppermint oil and its constituent menthol have antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis, species of fungus that causes oral and genital yeast infections; Trichophyton tonsurans, a species of fungus that causes scalp ringworm; and Aspergillus flavus, a species of fungus that infects certain foods and produces aflatoxin (31429, 43496, 43630, 57161, 59561, 68474, 68490).\nAntioxidant effects\nPeppermint oil has been shown to act as a radical scavenger and inhibit lipid peroxidation (68435). In other laboratory experiments, peppermint essential oil demonstrated antioxidant activity in a linoleic acid emulsion system by inhibiting conjugated dienes formation by 52.4% and linoleic acid secondary oxidized product generation by 76.9% (at 0.1% concentration) (68502).\nAntiparasitic effects\nEvidence from laboratory research suggests that several peppermint extracts inhibit the growth and adherence of Giardia lamblia, the parasite that causes giardiasis (68443). A dichloromethane fraction showed the best antigiardial activity, with an IC50 of 0.75 mcg/mL after 48 hours of incubation.\nAntiviral effects\nPeppermint oil has antiviral activity in vitro (13413, 13414). In vitro evidence shows that peppermint oil and aqueous peppermint extracts have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), including acyclovir-resistant HSV-1. Both peppermint preparations appear to inhibit the adsorption but not the intracellular viral replication of HSV (68407, 68447). Other in vitro evidence shows that the water-soluble polar substances of peppermint aqueous extract have potent anti-HIV-1 activity, with an ED of 16 mcg/mL (59406, 68471). It has been suggested that this effect may be due to increasing the virion density (68471).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPeppermint oil is used for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) due to its antispasmodic effects. It seems to reduce slow wave frequency in the small intestine, which slows peristaltic movement (13398, 68436). The antispasmodic activity appears to result from direct relaxing effects on the gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle, possibly due to blocking of calcium channels by menthol (6742, 6744, 11775, 18220, 39769, 68428, 68429, 68535, 68596, 68597, 96344, 96369). Menthol also acts as an agonist at the kappa opioid receptor and provides serotonergic antagonism (96360, 103063). Peppermint oil may also inhibit potassium depolarization-induced responses in the intestine (6744, 11775). This is thought to prevent the hypercontractility that is commonly found in patients with IBS. Peppermint oil may help relieve esophageal spasms by reducing esophageal contractions and improving the uniformity of contractions. Peppermint oil does not affect lower esophageal sphincter pressure (13415). In children, taking enteric-coated peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) 180-540 mg daily for 1 week decreased colon and sigmoid contraction frequency and increased stomach and duodenal contraction frequency; stomach contraction frequency was greatest with the 540 mg dose (107957). Preliminary evidence suggests that peppermint oil, when administered orally in enteric-coated capsules in combination with caraway oil, can reduce gastroduodenal motility and reduce visceral hyperalgesia, which plays a role in the development of symptoms related to functional gastrointestinal disorders (6742, 39768, 39786).\n\nThere is also interest in peppermint oil's effect on gut microbiome composition. A small, nonblinded clinical trial in children with functional abdominal pain shows that taking enteric-coated peppermint oil (Pepogest; Nature's Way) 180 mg once, twice, or three times daily for 1 week does not affect gut diversity or overall bacterial composition when compared with baseline (107956).\nHepatic effects\nPeppermint has exhibited liver protective effects in animal and laboratory research, likely mediated by antioxidant mechanisms (68384, 68386, 68453). However, peppermint has also been shown to induce dose-dependent hepatic damage and lipid peroxidation in rats (12731).\nHormonal effects\nAnecdotal reports suggest reduced libido in males consuming large quantities (4 cups per day) of peppermint tea. In male animals, peppermint leaf tea has been found to increase levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and reduce levels of testosterone (12732).\nInflammatory effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that the peppermint constituent, alpha-humulene, increases interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion and expression of IL-8 mRNA in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells, suggesting a pro-inflammatory effect (68423).\nNeurologic effects\nThe peppermint constituent L-menthol has been reported to increase cold perception, attenuate warmth perception, and possibly stimulate high-threshold cold fibers or cold-sensitive nociceptors in humans (39652, 68411, 68465, 68549, 68557, 68573, 68589). Some evidence suggests that inhalation of L-menthol decreases the sensation of respiratory discomfort during loaded breathing due to stimulation of cold receptors in the upper airway (68590). Also, L-menthol has been observed to increase the subjective sense of nasal air flow and induce a sensation of coolness in the nasal cavity following inhalation, likely via stimulation of the major palatine nerve (39652, 68465, 68476, 68549, 68573, 68589).\nPerformance-enhancing effects\nSome preliminary research suggests that peppermint aroma may improve cognition, attention, alertness, and tactile performance (56954, 68416, 68427, 68466). In animal research, peppermint essential oil increased ambulatory activity, possibly via inhibition of dopamine uptake (68378, 68396, 68477, 68506). In animal research, peppermint has been shown to reduce sleepiness, although the mechanism of action is unclear (51902, 68425).\nRadioprotective effects\nPeppermint has been shown to have protective effects against irradiation in animal research (68379, 68390, 68406, 68408, 68420, 68421, 68464, 68493). This effect may be related to the antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities of phenolic compounds found in peppermint (68442, 68493)."

Intake of perilla seed oil also increases levels of alpha-linolenic acid in the plasma (68650).\nMetabolism\nMost perilla extract constituents are found in glucuronidated or sulfated forms in the plasma and urine (68663). 1-O-(2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-beta-glucuronic acid and apigenin-4'-O-beta-glucuronide have both been detected in human plasma and urine (68631). Metabolism appears to be species-specific based on comparisons of rats and humans (68631). In an animal model, there is evidence that alpha-linolenic acid from perilla oil is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) (68690). It is not clear if this happens in humans.\nExcretion\nFollowing intake of perilla extract, rosmarinic acid, methylated rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and m-coumaric acid were detected in the urine. Most excretion is within 6 hours of intake (68663). Excreted compounds are generally in glucuronidated or sulfated forms (68631, 68663).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "Bone effects. There is interest in using perilla seed oil for preventing bone loss in aging. Clinical research in healthy middle-aged adults without osteoporosis shows that taking perilla seed oil 7 mL daily for 12 months attenuates the decline in bone mineral density and the increase in bone resorption, as measured by serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b) levels, when compared with olive oil (112152).\nGeneral\nThe applicable parts of perilla are the leaf, stem, and seed. These three plant parts are used as three different Chinese medicines (94313). Perilla contains multiple flavones. The major flavones, apigenin and luteolin, and their metabolites, are found in the leaves and seeds, along with other flavones including shishonin and vicenin-2 (6, 94312, 98592).\n\nThe leaf and stem color of the specific perilla plant is dependent on the constituent anthocyanins (98592). The leaf, stem, and seeds also contain phenolic compounds such as rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, as well as small amounts of triterpenes, tocopherols, and phytosterols (98593). Purple perilla contains the highest levels of phenolic compounds, including hydroxycinnamic acids, such as caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid (98592). The leaves and stem contain small amounts of volatile oils (94313). Rosmarinic acid is one of the main constituents in the leaves (94312), and the monoterpenoid perillaldehyde is one of the main constituents of the leaf essential oil (98593).\n\nPerilla seed oil is also high in the fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, found at levels of up to 64% of fatty acids. The seed oil also contains linoleic acid and oleic acid. Perilla seed also contains policosanol (94313). The main constituents of volatile perilla essential oil are perillaldehyde, D-limonene, 1,4-cineole, and eucalyptol (105526).\nAnti-allergy effects\nIn animal models, perilla reduces symptoms of allergy such as atopic dermatitis and airway inflammation (68639, 94313). Perilla extract appears to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and mast cell activity (68637, 94313). Perilla extract may also have an immunosuppressant effect by preferentially attenuating IgE production (6, 68693, 94313). Potential constituents of interest include a novel glycoprotein, alpha-linolenic acid, rosmarinic acid, or luteolin (68660, 68668, 94313). Alpha-linolenic acid is thought to increase the concentration of the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and inhibit the production of inflammatory leukotrienes (1338). In animal research, a change in generation of one leukotriene, LTC4¬, may be necessary for perilla-induced ventilatory improvements (65485).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of perilla leaf extract might explain the role of perilla leaf for traditional uses in cancer, allergies, asthma, and gastrointestinal issues (94313). Perilla leaf extract has shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models and laboratory research. It seems to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and the activity of cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. In human research, rosmarinic acid was able to reduce the numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid (68665, 68700, 94313). Perilla oil also has anti-inflammatory effects. The fatty acids in perilla oil reduce inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids (94313). A main constituent in the leaf essential oil, the monoterpene perillaldehyde, has anti-inflammatory effects in gastrointestinal inflammation models (98593).\nAnticancer effects\nPerilla is traditionally used in the treatment of cancer. Animal and in vitro studies suggest perilla oil may have antitumor effects (6, 68678, 68679). Cell and animal studies have shown perilla leaf extract to reduce proliferation of cancer cells and cause apoptosis (68654, 94313). The constituent luteolin is thought to have anti-proliferative activity (5003). Other constituents, including rosmarinic acid, have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects (94313).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAnti-microbial effects of perilla seed extract, perilla oil, and perilla essential oil have been shown (59507, 68646, 94313). Perilla seed extract contains luteolin, a compound with strong anti-bacterial effects against oral cariogenic Streptococci and Porphyromonas gingivalis (68646). The essential oils appear to have both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects (59497, 59507).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults shows that consuming soybean milk fortified with perilla fruit extract 1%, 180 mL twice daily, for 30 days reduces serum reactive oxygen species levels and increases phagocytotic activity when compared with placebo (110613).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking perilla oil 7 mL daily for 12 months does not improve blood pressure when compared with taking olive oil (105525).\nDermatologic effects\nPatch testing suggests 1-perillaldehyde and perillalcohol contained in perilla oil are responsible for the occurrence of dermatitis (6).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using perilla oil to improve gastrointestinal health. Preliminary clinical research in healthy athletes shows that taking perilla oil 1-3 grams orally three times a day for 8 weeks does not increase fecal microbiota diversity scores when compared with placebo. However, taking perilla oil inconsistently increased gut Bacteroidetes bacteria and decreased gut Firmicutes bacteria (110614).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn animal research, perilla oil decreases levels of serum cholesterol and/or triglycerides, possibly due to its alpha-linolenic acid content (68667, 68701, 68702, 101811). However, preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking perilla oil 7 mL daily for 12 months does not improve serum cholesterol or triglycerides levels when compared with taking olive oil (105525).\nNephroprotective effects\nPerilla might have beneficial effects for kidney health. In laboratory research, perilla extract has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells following stimulation by inflammatory cytokines. Potentially active constituents include caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and a luteolin derivative (5003, 68638, 68648). Animal models suggest benefits of perilla for IgA nephropathy and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (68629, 68638, 68649).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using perilla to treat mental health disorders. Perilla is found in traditional Chinese formulations for depression. Perilla has demonstrated antidepressant effects in animal models. The benefits appear to be related to constituents such as the fatty acid profile of the seed oil, as well as rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and perillaldehyde (94313). Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking perilla oil 7 mL daily for 12 months may mildly improve depression and apathy scores when compared with taking olive oil, but the clinical relevance of these changes is unclear (105525).\n\nResearch in mice shows that inhalation of perilla essential oil increases expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and increases levels of GABA and serotonin in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. In theory, these effects may help treat insomnia. Animal research in mice with insomnia shows that inhalation of perilla essential oil improves sleep latency and total duration of sleep and reduces some signs and symptoms of insomnia, such as attenuated weight gain, when compared with control (105526).\nWeight loss effects\nIn vitro, perilla extract inhibits the accumulation of adipose in adipose cells. The mechanism is possibly associated with inhibiting the synthesis of triglycerides and the fat storage unit, as well as inhibiting genes involved in the maturation of the adipocyte. In an animal model, perilla extract reduced body fat after intake of a high fat diet, possibly by improving levels of leptin and adiponectin, inducing genes involved in fat breakdown, and reducing growth of the adipocyte (98582). However, preliminary clinical research in healthy normal and overweight adults shows that taking perilla oil 7 mL daily for 12 months does not reduce body weight when compared with taking olive oil (105525)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nIn rats, intranasal application of perillyl alcohol results in ten-fold higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-to-plasma ratios of perillyl alcohol and ten-fold higher CSF and plasma concentrations of its metabolite, perillic acid, when compared with equivalent doses administered intravascularly. This suggests that the intranasal route of administration provides direct and increased central exposure to perillyl alcohol (106534).\nMetabolism\nIn the body, the majority of perillyl alcohol is converted to metabolites perillaldehyde, perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid (15280). After ingestion of perillyl alcohol 2000 mg/m² daily, the parent drug is not detected in plasma; however, the metabolites perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid are detected. Peak levels of perillic acid are over ten-fold higher than peak levels of dihydroperillic acid and occur approximately 1 to 5 hours after intake. Peak levels of dihydroperillic acid occur up to 2 hours after perillic acid (15274, 15279, 58047, 58132, 68703, 68708, 68710, 68713, 98639).\nExcretion\nThe half-lives of perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid are estimated to be between 1 to 2.4 hours (68710). Perillyl alcohol, perillic acid, and dihydroperillic acid are all excreted in the urine (58047).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPerillyl alcohol is a monoterpene that occurs naturally in the essential oils of plants such as lavender, spearmint, cherries, and citrus fruits (15275, 41170, 98636, 98637, 98640). Perillyl alcohol is the hydroxylated form of another monoterpene, limonene, and is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway (15285, 112069).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nIn animals with ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma, treatment with perillyl alcohol 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection daily for 7 days reduces lung tissue and lavage fluid levels of proinflammatory factors (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappa-beta), and markers of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, nitrite, and total protein). It also decreases infiltration of leukocytes, and serum levels of immunoglobulin E, and improves lung damage and pathological changes associated with asthma. Perillyl alcohol increases total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and levels of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant factors (IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione) (112070).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using perillyl alcohol for cancer. Preliminary evidence shows that perillyl alcohol can inhibit the growth of several cancer cell types include liver, lung, colon, prostate, breast, glioblastoma, pancreatic, and leukemia in vitro or in animal models (15274, 15275, 15276, 15277, 15282, 15285, 15307, 15308, 68712, 68718). Topical use inhibits skin tumor incidence in an animal model (68727). Perillyl alcohol is a more potent tumor cell inhibitor than limonene, another naturally occurring monoterpene (15274, 15279).\n\nIt is not clear how perillyl alcohol and other monoterpenes inhibit cancer cell growth. High concentrations of perillyl alcohol seem to inhibit cancer cell growth by inhibiting isoprenylation of GTPase proteins (15274). Perillyl alcohol seems to inhibit the isoprenylation enzymes farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase (15275, 98635). Perillyl alcohol might also decrease Ras protein synthesis (15274, 98635). In animal models, dietary intake of perillyl alcohol reduces Ras prenylation by farnesyl transferase by 17% (15275). Perillyl alcohol might also modulate cyclin D1, induce TGF-beta1, and induce apoptosis (15275, 15307, 68711, 68712, 68715, 68716, 98635). In prostate cancer cells, perillyl alcohol inhibits the function of the androgen receptor (68721). However, perillyl alcohol does not induce apoptosis in human resected prostate cancer cells (98638). Perillyl alcohol might also have anticancer effects by inhibiting angiogenesis (15280). The anticancer effects of perillyl alcohol appear to be enhanced by hyperthermia (15281).\n\nIn animal models, tumor regression occurs when plasma levels reach 390-480 microMol of perillic acid and 110-230 microMol of dihydroperillic acid (15280).\n\nIn some cases, perillyl alcohol seems to promote tumorigenesis. In an animal model of esophageal cancer, perillyl alcohol seems to increase dysplasia and tumor multiplicity (15275).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal models of inflammatory disorders, perillyl alcohol decreases serum levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL- 23, IL-1-beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It also reduces expression of inflammatory proteins including cyclooxygenase-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-17a, IL-22, nuclear factor-kappa-B, and signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) (112069).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal models of inflammatory disorders, perillyl alcohol restores normal levels of endogenous antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase, and of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRf2), a transcription factor that regulates cellular resistance to oxidants. It also restores normal levels of the free radical, nitric oxide (NO), and the marker of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA) (112069).\nDermatologic effects\nPerillyl alcohol has antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties which contribute to its activity in animal models of psoriasis. It inhibits phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa-B and signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) which are part of the inflammatory signaling cascade. Applying 200 mg/kg perillyl alcohol topically for 5 days to mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis lesions reduces epidermal hyperplasia, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, psoriasis area, and severity index, and also ameliorates splenomegaly and increased body temperature caused by the excessive immunological activity (112069).\nMosquito repellent effects\nPerillyl alcohol is a component of some essential oils that are used as mosquito repellents. Perillyl alcohol appears to have significant mosquito repellent activity (15278).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn vitro, perillyl alcohol seems to protect human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from 6-hydroxydopamine cytotoxicity. The 6-hydroxydamine model is a commonly studied model of Parkinson disease (98640). Other in vitro research shows that perillyl alcohol may protect SH-SY5Y cells from amyloid-beta peptide-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that perillyl alcohol might have some benefit for Alzheimer disease (98637).\n\nIn animals with methyl-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson disease, perillyl alcohol reverses processes leading to neurodegeneration, including lowering mitochondrial superoxide anion levels, increasing antioxidant enzyme levels, and reducing activation and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1-beta and IL-18. It also increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain, which are reduced in Parkinson disease (112071)."

A case of occupational contact dermatitis characterized by pruritus, erythema, eczema, and dyspnea has been reported for a 41-year-old farmer who handled the green parts of Phaseolus vulgaris (29920).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, an extract of the Phaseolus vulgaris variety white kidney bean, as well as alpha-amylase inhibitors isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris, might cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation, satiety, and stomach pains (11265, 18223, 29925, 104874). Also, white kidney bean extract, taken orally along with carob gum, may cause constipation, flatulence, soft stools, and reduced levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid (10633). Consuming large amounts of raw or undercooked Phaseolus vulgaris beans or extract can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis due to the content of phytohaemagglutinin, a plant protein lectin (18223, 29916, 93082).

While some small studies show conflicting findings (12186, 26158), most research in overweight and obese adults suggests that taking white kidney bean extract 800-1000 mg or cranberry bean extract 100 mg three times daily for 5-12 weeks reduces body weight by 1.5-4 kg, body mass index by about 0.7 kg/m2, and waist circumference by about 1.5-5 cm when compared with placebo or other control (26156, 29926, 93075, 93077, 104875). Specific products evaluated include Phase 2 (Pharmachem Labs; also marketed as Starchlite and Phaselite) (26156, 29926); Carb Intercept with Phase 2 (Natrol LLC) (93075); and Beanblock (Indena S.p.A) (93077).\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris extract has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, with modestly positive results.

Results from the study show that the odds for advanced adenoma recurrence is 65% lower for patients who consume higher amounts of Phaseolus vulgaris when compared with those who consume lower amounts (29922).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that oral Phaseolus vulgaris may not improve postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nWhile results from some small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that taking Phaseolus vulgaris extract or consuming Phaseolus vulgaris beans can reduce postprandial glucose levels, most studies, including a meta-analysis of 6 small clinical trials, show that Phaseolus vulgaris does not significantly reduce postprandial glucose when compared with placebo or other control (93078, 107439). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking 15 grams of a combination of Phaseolus vulgaris pod, white mulberry, and bilberry three times daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose by up to 24% when compared with baseline (33943). It is unclear if these findings are due to Phaseolus vulgaris, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral Phaseolus vulgaris has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small, open-label clinical study in overweight and obese patients shows that taking Phaseolus vulgaris (white kidney bean) extract 300-600 mg plus carob gum extract 50-100 mg three times daily for 3-9 months modestly reduces total cholesterol levels and increases excretion of fat in the feces when compared to baseline (10633). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral Phaseolus vulgaris extract is beneficial in patients with kidney stones.\nA small clinical study in adults with small kidney stones shows that taking a Phaseolus vulgaris extract made from 250 grams of green beans three times a week for 6 weeks modestly reduces the size of kidney stones and lowers urinary calcium and oxalate levels when compared with a control group (104874).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral Phaseolus vulgaris is beneficial for the prevention of lung cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming higher amounts of dietary phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones from Phaseolus vulgaris beans and soy, is associated with a 44% to 72% lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with consuming lower amounts.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Phaseolus vulgaris.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Phaseolus vulgaris are the beans and, for some varieties, the pod. Phaseolus vulgaris beans contain phaseolamin, an alpha-amylase inhibitor (29924). Phaseolus vulgaris beans also contain lectins, including phytohemagglutinin (33939, 93082). The lectins are most concentrated in the cotyledons or endosperm of the beans (93082). Phaseolus vulgaris beans are also a good source of protein, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber (93082).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, extracts of black beans, a variety of Phaseolus vulgaris, shows bactericidal effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes (33941).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary research shows that Phaseolus vulgaris lectins can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in vitro (93082).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPhaseolus vulgaris bean contains phaseolamin, an enzyme that prevents starch from being digested by alpha-amylases in the small intestines (29924, 29925). In humans, phaseolamin inhibits alpha-amylase activity by more than 95% for 1-2 hours when taken orally prior to eating a starch-containing meal (29924). Phaseolus vulgaris bean promotes the fermentation of starch by gut bacteria in the large intestines (29924, 29925). Theoretically, this action results in fewer absorbed calories and reduces glycemic responses in humans (12186, 29923, 29924, 29925). However, some research in humans shows that taking a specific Phaseolus vulgaris (white kidney bean) extract (Phaseolamin) with a meal does not significantly inhibit digestion and absorption of starch based on the caloric content of stool samples and insulin response (15177, 15178). Clinical research in adults with obesity also shows that taking Phaseolus vulgaris (white kidney bean) extract 2.4 grams daily for 5 weeks does not lower fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (104875).\nAntioxidant effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that Phaseolus vulgaris pod extract 200 mg/kg of body weight for 45 days significantly reduces thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides, while increasing concentrations of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (33935). Theoretically, the antioxidant capacity of Phaseolus vulgaris pod might contribute to its antidiabetic and antineoplastic effects.\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro, Phaseolus vulgaris (black bean) extract inhibits the growth of Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Trichomonas vaginalis (33941).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, phytohemagglutinin, a lectin constituent of Phaseolus vulgaris, induces the synthesis of an interferon-like virus inhibitor in cultured human leucocytes. The interferon-like chemical inhibits the cytopathic effects of Sindbis virus (33938). Phaseolus vulgaris lectin has also been shown to inhibit leukemia virus, HIV virus, myxoviruses, and coronaviruses in vitro (93082). Phaseolus vulgaris lectins appear to prevent HIV virus from fusing with and infecting normal T-lymphocytes. The lectins also appear to prevent HIV replication (93082).\nBone effects\nIn ovariectomized, adult Sprague-Dawley rats, oral administration of estradiol 0.15 mg/kg in combination with methanolic extract of Phaseolus vulgaris bean 1 gram/kg for 10 weeks significantly increases bone and ash density, bone mechanical strength, and bone calcium levels and reduces serum alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and urinary calcium levels (33942). Theoretically, Phaseolus vulgaris bean may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for postmenopausal osteoporosis.\nWeight loss effects\nPhaseolus vulgaris bean contains enzymes that prevent starch from being digested by alpha-amylases in the small intestines. Instead, Phaseolus vulgaris bean promotes the fermentation of starch by gut bacteria in the large intestines (29924, 29925). Evidence from human research suggests that this inhibition of alpha amylase decreases carbohydrate breakdown and absorption in the GI tract and theoretically results in fewer calories ingested (12186, 15518). It is also thought that Phaseolus vulgaris bean might suppress appetite (18223, 29925). Preliminary clinical research shows that Phaseolus vulgaris bean may suppress appetite by suppressing ghrelin secretion. Ghrelin is a stomach-secreted peptide that enhances appetite (93081)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if topical phellodendron is beneficial in patients with acne.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate acne shows that applying a facial mask containing an unknown dose of phellodendron for 15-20 minutes daily for 3 days, then every other day for 8 weeks, reduces the number of acne lesions when compared to baseline. About 33% of patients showed a moderate improvement and 11% showed an excellent improvement in overall lesions at week 8. However, no significant difference in the total number of lesions was seen (97317).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral phellodendron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking five tablets of a specific traditional Chinese medicine product containing phellodendron bark, gardenia fruit, licorice root, safflower, Indian long pepper, and other ingredients three times daily with conventional therapy for 6 months improves storage-related lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and nocturia, when compared with placebo plus conventional therapy. However, this product did not appear to improve voiding-related symptoms (109450).\nless\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral phellodendron for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of phellodendron for this purpose.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Topical phellodendron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults with diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying gauze soaked in a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) solution containing phellodendron, forsythia, honeysuckle, dandelion, and Scolopendra once daily for 4 weeks is associated with a higher rate of clinical efficacy and greater reduction in wound area when compared with applying gauze soaked with a Kangfuxin control solution (106438). Kangfuxin is an herbal TCM solution commonly used in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The validity of these findings is limited by the unclear reporting of outcomes and discrepancies in the data. Additionally, it is unclear how these findings would compare with the use of standard care. A small clinical study in adults undergoing negative pressure wound aspiration therapy (NPWT) for diabetic foot ulcers shows that the addition of liquid compound phellodendron TCM irrigation to NPWT for 30 days improves wound symptom scores and wound healing and bacterial cultures compared with saline control (112389). A moderate size clinical study in adults undergoing ultrasonic debridement for diabetic foot ulcers shows that rinsing the wound with a liquid compound phellodendron TCM for 4 weeks reduces wound area and bacterial cultures and improves healing rate and efficacy compared with a Kangfuxin control solution (112390). The lack of blinding and randomization limits the validity of these findings. Additionally, in all three trials the phellodendron solution contained other TCM ingredients such as forsythia, honeysuckle, dandelion, golden cypress, and centipede (106438, 112389, 112390). Thus, it is unclear if the effects are due to phellodendron, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. Oral phellodendron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in overweight individuals shows that taking a specific blend of phellodendron and sweet orange extracts (Citrofen, Next Pharmaceuticals) 740 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight by 3.7% when compared with placebo (94902, 94903). This blend also seems to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 30% and triglycerides by about 14% when compared with placebo. It also appears to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure and fasting glucose (94902). Another specific combination product containing a combination of extracts of phellodendron plus magnolia (Relora, Next Pharmaceuticals) has been evaluated for weight loss in females who have a tendency to eat during stressful situations. One small clinical study in overweight, postmenopausal individuals shows that taking this product 250 mg three times daily for 6 weeks prevents weight gain when compared with placebo (14349). However, another small clinical study in overweight, postmenopausal individuals shows that taking this product at the same dose for 6 weeks does not decrease appetite, caloric intake, body weight, or waist or hip circumference when compared with placebo (94901).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral phellodendron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that taking a specific blend of phellodendron and sweet orange extracts (Citrofen, Next Pharmaceuticals) 740 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves functional measures of joint pain and movement by 16% to 41% when compared with placebo (94903).\nless\nPeptic ulcers.

Although there has been interest in using oral phellodendron for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of phellodendron for this purpose.\nWound healing. Topical phellodendron has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate sized clinical trial in adults recovering from anal fistulotomy shows that using 200 mL of compound phellodendron decoction in 1.8 liters of warm water for fumigation and sitting (sitz) bath for 7 days reduces pain, wound edema and exudation, and total wound healing time compared with fumigation and sitz bath with warm water alone (112391). Four other herbs were in the decoction, so it is unclear if the effects are due to phellodendron, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate phellodendron for these uses.",

It also appears to be a substrate of nuclear transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter. Theoretically, this might limit its oral bioavailability (13525).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "Wound healing effects. Proposed mechanisms for topical compound phellodendron decoctions to aid wound healing includes an increase in the proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocytes within the wound and an increase in the proportion of IL-2 and IL-12 to IL-5 and IL-6 expression, potentially contributing to a greater increase in endothelial cell and capillary growth in the granulation tissue and greater collagen expression (112391).\nGeneral\nThe applicable part of phellodendron is the bark. Phellodendron contains berberine, palmatine, coumarins, phellodendrine, and other alkaloids (12428, 12429, 94905).\nAnti-cancer effects\nPreliminary research suggests that the constituent berberine might have antitumor effects (13521).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nPhellodendron is traditionally used for diabetes. In human research, a specific blend of sweet orange and phellodendron extracts (Citrofen, Next Pharmaceuticals) decreased levels of fasting glucose (94902). In combination with the extract from Aralia elata, phellodendron seems to protect the kidneys in laboratory models of diabetes (12427). The constituent berberine seems to inhibit aldose reductase (13520). It is unclear if phellodendron alone has anti-diabetic effects.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPhellodendron is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory. In human research a specific combination of sweet orange and phellodendron extracts (Citrofen, Next Pharmaceuticals) reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (94903). In both animal research and human clinical trials, topically applied phellodendron seems to have anti-inflammatory activity (12431, 112389). Preliminary research also suggests that the constituent berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488). Other preliminary research shows that phellodendron and berberine blocks production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production (13522).\nAnti-stress effects\nPhellodendron is of interest for reducing stress-associated eating. Although findings are not consistent, some evidence suggests that phellodendron in combination with magnolia decreases levels of salivary cortisol (94904).\nAnti-ulcer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that phellodendron has antiulcer activity, even in the absence of the constituent berberine (12430). However, berberine might also have anti-ulcer activity based on the ability to reduce the secretion of gastric acid (13537).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPhellodendron is traditionally used for eye infections. The constituents palmatine and berberine both have anti-microbial effects in laboratory research. Palmatine seems to have antifungal effects (12428). Berberine has antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Specifically, berberine has shown activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Eschericha coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenkii, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia (2530, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that the constituent berberine might protect the liver from hepatotoxins (13519). At least some evidence suggests that protection may be related to the role of phellodendron and its constituent berberine in reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (13522).\nHypolipidemic effects\nSome evidence in humans suggests that phellodendron might inhibit levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Animal research suggests this may be due to an increased expression of the LDL receptor (94902).\nImmunosuppressant effects\nThe constituent phellodendrine has immunosuppressant effects in laboratory research (12429).\nWeight loss effects\nFor weight loss, researchers suggest that a specific phellodendron product containing a combination of extracts of phellodendron plus magnolia (Relora, Next Pharmaceuticals) helps reduce cortisol levels and therefore helps to reduced stress. It's theorized that reducing stress will reduce stress-induced eating habits. Some clinical research suggests that cortisol levels might be reduced (94904). However, not all research agrees (14349)."

Animal research suggests that phenethylamine follows first-order kinetics and has a half-life of 1.1 minutes in the brain (24357, 29933).\n\nElimination: Exogenous phenethylamine is excreted in the urine as phenethylamine and the metabolites 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide sulfate and phenylacetylglutamine (109442).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General: Endogenous phenethylamine is formed from decarboxylation of phenylalanine (109442).\n\nPsychological effects: Phenethylamine is a monoamine alkaloid that functions as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter. The chemical structure of phenethylamine is similar to that of other sympathomimetic amines, including amphetamine, and consequently phenethylamine also functions as a stimulant (29931).\n\nLike amphetamine, phenethylamine stimulates serotonin and catecholamine release and inhibits serotonin and catecholamine uptake by activating trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) (24340, 24344, 24354, 24356). However, the concentration of phenethylamine required to induce amphetamine-like effects is approximately 100-fold higher than endogenous levels of phenethylamine under basal conditions (29934). Like amphetamine, evidence from animal research shows that large doses of phenethylamine or concomitant administration of phenethylamine and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor can increase locomotor activity, stereotypic behavior, and behavior maintained by intracranial self-stimulation (29934, 109441). Animal research in mice and rats also shows that consumption of beta-phenethylamine activates the dopamine D1 receptor in the dorsal striatum (109441).\n\nThe antidepressant or mood-improving effects of phenethylamine stem from its ability to reduce uptake and increase efflux of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. In vivo, urinary levels of endogenous phenethylamine have been shown to increase by 77% following physical activity, suggesting that an increase in exogenous phenethylamine levels may be associated with the antidepressant or mood-enhancing effect of exercise (24341). Also, in vivo evidence shows that endogenous phenethylamine levels are decreased in some patients with depression (29928). Furthermore, preliminary clinical evidence shows that administration of phenethylamine along with selegiline can improve symptoms in some of these patients (24338).\n\nIn addition to patients with depression, some preliminary clinical evidence shows that urinary levels of endogenous phenethylamine are lower in some children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism (24335, 24336, 24337). Other preliminary clinical evidence shows that children with ADHD who respond to treatment with methylphenidate show increased urinary levels of phenethylamine compared to nonresponders (24337). Theoretically, modulating phenethylamine levels in patients with ADHD or autism might have beneficial effects, although this has not been evaluated in clinical research.\n\nOther preliminary clinical evidence suggests that certain types of schizophrenia may be associated with excess endogenous phenethylamine. In vivo evidence shows that urinary levels of phenethylamine are increased in some patients with schizoaffective disorder or paranoid schizophrenia (29928). It is hypothesized that excess phenethylamine may worsen schizophrenia by increasing dopamine transmission, which may contribute to symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations or delusions. Animal research in mice and rats shows that consumption of beta-phenethylamine 50 mg/kg orally increases some psychoactive behaviors when compared with control (109441)."

Despite this, phenibut-containing products can still be purchased at \"head shops\" and unregulated online suppliers (104511, 106838). Phenibut has the potential for dependence, abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and overdose, especially when used at high doses or recreationally. While phenibut dosing in Russia typically ranges from 250-500 mg, the amount of phenibut in some products purchased online has been found to be greater, further increasing the risk for adverse outcomes (106838).",

Phenibut also appears to prevent respiratory arrest induced by serotonin in animals (15849). In humans, ingestion of large doses of phenibut can induce a state of sedation, respiratory depression, and diminished consciousness; these same doses have also been associated with the development of acute delirium (96748, 96750, 96752, 112293).\n\nAnimal research suggests that phenibut might have neuroprotective effects.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nA pooled analysis of 18 clinical studies shows that peak absorption of phenylalanine occurs within about 60 minutes of ingestion of whey, casein, or milk protein. Approximately 50% of phenylalanine is absorbed within 5 hours. Subgroup analyses show that absorption is increased with larger protein doses and decreased in older adults (104791).\nMetabolism\nL-phenylalanine is metabolized to tyrosine (2052, 9949). Some clinical research shows that, following an oral dose of a pseudo-racemic mixture of L-phenylalanine and D-phenylalanine, L-phenylalanine is hydroxylated to L-tyrosine, while one-third of D-phenylalanine is converted to L-phenylalanine and subsequently hydroxylated to L-tyrosine (2052).\nExcretion\nOnly a small amount of L-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine due to its incorporation into proteins in the body. However, a substantial amount of oral doses of D-phenylalanine or DL-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine in healthy adults (2052).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPhenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid that exists as L and D enantiomers, although L-phenylalanine is the only form incorporated into proteins. D-phenylalanine is non-nutritive and its role in humans is not currently understood, although about one-third of an oral dose of D-phenylalanine is converted to L-phenylalanine (2023, 2052, 92703).\nAnalgesic effects\nSome animal research shows that D-phenylalanine increases the pain threshold (2459). A potential mechanism is inhibition of carboxypeptidase, which normally breaks down enkephalins (2456, 2459). However, L-phenylalanine does not seem to alter pain tolerance in healthy people (2460).\nAntidepressant effects\nTheoretically, L-phenylalanine could have antidepressant activity through its metabolite, 2-phenylethylamine, which has neuromodulator effects, improving mood and attention (68827, 68829). L-phenylalanine is also a precursor of norepinephrine. Increasing levels of this neurotransmitter is a known mechanism of some antidepressant drugs (68829, 68830).\nEnzyme inhibition\nD-phenylalanine is reported to reduce deactivation of opioids in the reward center of the brain by inhibition of a peptidase enzyme. Theoretically, this could reduce the symptoms associated with withdrawal from alcohol (30100).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nL-phenylalanine's effects in vitiligo may be explained by the inhibition of antibodies to melanocytes (2463).\nMetabolic effects\nIn healthy adults, taking a single dose of 10 grams of D- or L-phenylalanine increases postprandial insulin and glucagon levels and decreases postprandial blood glucose levels when compared with placebo. However, taking a lower 5-gram dose of L-phenylalanine does not reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (104792, 104793).\nNeurological effects\nIn patients with schizophrenia or depression, taking a single dose of phenylalanine 100 mg/kg has been associated with worsening of medication-induced tardive dyskinesia (2457, 2458). L-phenylalanine is a precursor of norepinephrine, levels of which have been reported to be elevated in patients with tardive dyskinesia (68829, 68830)."

This was accompanied by an improvement in insulin resistance and reduced lipid levels in the blood (100157). Animal research also suggests that phlorizin stimulates lipolysis (27158).\nAntidiabetic effects\nResults from animal research show that phlorizin reduces fasting blood glucose levels (27156, 27176, 27178, 27182, 100157, 100158). Phlorizin is a potent, nonselective inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). Inhibition of SGLT1, which is found mainly in the small intestines and to some extent in the later convoluted tubule, reduces glucose absorption. Inhibition of SGLT2, which is found in the early proximal convoluted tubule, inhibits glucose reabsorption, which increases the excretion of glucose in the urine (27149, 27152, 27182, 100518). In addition, phloretin, a metabolite of phlorizin, can inhibit intestinal glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which reduces the absorption of glucose. Despite its hypoglycemic potential, phlorizin was not developed as an antidiabetes drug due to its poor bioavailability, rapid degradation, and potential gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea (100518)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nBowel preparation. Oral sodium phosphate is effective for cleansing the colon in preparation for colonoscopy; however, it is unclear whether sodium phosphate is as effective as polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution. Some products are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use. However, due to the potential for kidney damage, sodium phosphate is not recommended as first-line therapy.\nSodium phosphate tablets (OsmoPrep, Salix Pharmaceuticals; Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals) are FDA-approved for cleansing the colon in preparation for colonoscopy. Clinical research shows that using the OsmoPrep formulation can achieve an \"excellent\" or \"good\" response rate, which is defined as having 90% of the mucosa visible with only some or little suctioning needed, in 94% to 97% of patients (88133). Similarly, using the specific product Visicol has been shown to achieve an excellent or good response rate in 82% to 86% of patients (94674). Non-FDA-approved sodium phosphate products have also been investigated. One such product (Fleet Phospho-soda, C. B. Fleet Co.) has been shown to achieve adequate bowel cleansing in 23% to 89% of patients (93846, 94673). Another sodium phosphate tablet preparation (Clicolon tablets, Korea Pharma Co.) has been shown to achieve adequate bowel cleansing in 63% to 93% of patients (93848, 93850, 93853). Excellent or good bowel cleansing was found in 98.6% of patients using a 32-tablet regimen of other sodium phosphate tablets (Quiklean, Universal Integrated Corporation) (107008). Reasons for the differences in the percentage of patients who achieve adequate bowel cleansing with the same sodium phosphate product may relate to the method used to analyze bowel cleansing, differences in diet followed during bowel cleansing, and demographic factors (93846, 93848, 93850, 93853). Various preparations (OsmoPrep, Salix Pharmaceuticals; Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals; Clicolon tablets, Korea Pharma Co.; Quiklean, Universal Integrated Corporation) have been used which contain 1.102 grams of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 0.398 grams of sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous. These products have been taken as 3-4 tablets with 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes for a total of 20 tablets the evening before colonoscopy, and 3-4 tablets with 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes for a total of 12-20 tablets the morning of a colonoscopy (88133, 93848, 93850, 94674, 107008). Also, sodium phosphate solution (Fleet Phospho-soda, C. B. Fleet Co.) containing sodium hydrogen phosphate 24.4 grams and disodium phosphate dodecahydrate 10.8 grams has also been used the morning and evening before the procedure (93846).\n\nNumerous publications have compared the bowel cleansing activity of sodium phosphate with PEG solution. When given as a split-overnight dosage, sodium phosphate is about as effective as PEG solutions in achieving adequate bowel cleansing. However, when day-before dosage is used, PEG is more effective for bowel cleansing than sodium phosphate (93861, 93862, 107008). Sodium phosphate and PEG may have different effectiveness depending on the colonic site assessed. When only trials assessing descending colon cleansing are considered, sodium phosphate is found to work similarly to PEG solutions. When only studies assessing ascending colon cleansing are considered, PEG is more effective for bowel cleansing than sodium phosphate (93861). Also, a large clinical trial in outpatients scheduled for non-sedated colonoscopy shows that receiving PEG resulted in an easier insertion and a less painful colonoscopy when compared with receiving sodium phosphate (104473). However, in patients with chronic constipation, sodium phosphate seems to be preferable. A meta-analysis of three small clinical studies in adults with chronic constipation shows that using sodium phosphate has an 87% greater chance of a successful bowel preparation when compared with using PEG (104472).\n\nSodium phosphate is not recommended as first-line therapy for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy due to the potential for kidney damage (93863, 94672). In fact, one sodium phosphate preparation (Fleet Phospho-soda, C. B. Fleet Co.) that was previously approved as an over-the-counter supplement for bowel preparation in the US was withdrawn from the market for this indication in December 2008 due to concerns for phosphate-induced kidney disease (94672). Of the sodium phosphate products that are still approved by the FDA, current guidelines recommend that these products not be used for bowel cleansing in patients with kidney disease, pre-existing electrolyte disturbances, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, ascites, or inflammatory bowel disease. Guidelines also recommend that caution should be used if these products are prescribed for patients who are elderly, hypertensive, or taking certain classes of drugs (94672).\n\nFor small bowel preparation for endoscopy, a meta-analysis suggests that sodium phosphate is no more effective than fasting alone (93860).\nless\nHypophosphatemia. Oral or intravenous phosphate salts are effective for the prevention or treatment of hypophosphatemia. Some products are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use.\nTaking sodium or potassium phosphate orally is effective for preventing and treating hypophosphatemia (15). Treating hypophosphatemia with oral phosphates requires monitoring of serum electrolyte levels to determine appropriate dosing (15). The FDA-approved intravenous (IV) product is also used for the correction of hypophosphatemia (8302, 8303, 88135). FDA-approved intravenous (IV) sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate 15-30 mmol is typically given over 2-12 hours. Higher doses have been used if needed to increase efficacy (8302, 8303, 88135).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Oral or rectal sodium phosphate is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) products to treat constipation.\nSodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted ingredient of oral and rectal OTC products intended for the treatment of constipation (88107).\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as ingredients in over-the-counter (OTC) antacids.\nAluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients of oral OTC products intended for use as antacids (88107).\nless\nHypercalcemia. Although other treatments are preferred, oral non-calcium phosphate salts are beneficial for treatment of mild to moderate hypercalcemia.\nTaking phosphate salts (except calcium phosphate) orally is effective for treating mild to moderate hypercalcemia (88144, 88145). Treating hypercalcemia with oral phosphates requires monitoring of serum electrolyte levels to determine appropriate dosing (15); other agents are now preferred (6479). Intravenous phosphates should be avoided due to the risk of calcium precipitation in vital organs (metastatic calcification) (15, 88144, 88145).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral potassium phosphate seems to be beneficial for prevention of kidney stones in individuals with hypercalciuria.\nTaking potassium phosphate orally may help prevent calcium oxalate kidney stones in patients with hypercalciuria (6470). Clinical research in adults with absorptive hypercalciuria and at high risk for stone formation shows that taking a specific slow-release potassium phosphate product (Uro-Phos-K, Mission Pharmacal), providing phosphate 620 mg orally twice daily for 4 days, reduces urinary calcium excretion by 35% to 40% (2208, 2209). Potassium and sodium phosphate salts providing 1200-1500 mg of elemental phosphate daily have been used (2209, 6470).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. The evidence is mixed as to whether oral sodium phosphate improves cycling or running performance. Most research suggests that oral calcium phosphate and potassium phosphate are not beneficial.\nClinical research shows that taking calcium phosphate or potassium phosphate orally does not improve running or cycling performance (2499, 9300, 8301).\n\nEvidence for the use of sodium phosphate to improve cycling performance is mixed. One very small clinical study shows that taking sodium phosphate as tribasic sodium phosphate dodecahydrate for 6 days before a 10-mile cycling trial increases mean power output by about 10% and decreases the time needed to complete the trial by 3% in trained male cyclists (88150). Other small clinical trials in trained cyclists show that taking the same form of sodium phosphate as 50 mg/kg of fat-free mass in four divided doses daily for 6 days modestly improves work, power output, and peak oxygen uptake and reduces heart rate during high-intensity cycling exercise when compared to baseline (93857, 93858, 93859, 107007). However, conflicting research shows that taking a similar loading regimen of sodium phosphate, as tribasic sodium phosphate dodecahydrate or dibasic sodium phosphate, does not improve time trial performance, work accomplished relative to energy expenditure, power output, oxygen uptake, or perceived exertion in trained cyclists (93855, 93856, 107007, 116269).\n\nSodium phosphate has also been evaluated for improving running performance, with mixed findings. Two small clinical trials in female athletes show that tribasic sodium phosphate dodecahydrate 50 mg/kg of fat-free mass taken in four divided doses daily for 6 days moderately improves repeated sprint times when compared with placebo (93843, 93844). However, taking the same dosage does not significantly improve sprint times in male athletes (93849). Also, sodium phosphate does not seem to improve endurance or aerobic capacity in treadmill tests (8301, 93854). Reasons for the discrepancies regarding the effects of sodium phosphate on athletic performance are not entirely clear, but likely relate to the very small number of participants in the included trials.\nless\nDiabetic ketoacidosis. Potassium phosphate infusion is not recommended as first-line therapy for adults with diabetic ketoacidosis.\nClinical research shows that intravenous infusion of potassium phosphate 8.5 mmol/hour (approximately 6 grams of phosphate over 24 hours) along with potassium chloride 12.5 mEq/hour provides no benefit over potassium chloride alone in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis (88149). Guidelines for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis in the both the US and UK do not recommend phosphate replacement for most patients.

It is unclear if oral aluminum phosphate gel prevents early rebleeding following endoscopic therapy for gastric variceal bleeding.\nAn observational study in patients with cirrhosis and gastric variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic variceal histoacryl injection therapy shows that taking oral aluminum phosphate gel 20 grams twice daily for 4 weeks combined with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) reduces early rebleeding rates by 10% compared with PPI alone(116271).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Calcium phosphate seems to be beneficial for bone density improvement; however, it does not seem to be more beneficial than calcium carbonate.\nIn postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis and low phosphate intakes, taking calcium 1800 mg daily as tricalcium phosphate for 12 months improves lumbar spine and hip densities. However, it is no more effective than taking the same amount of calcium as calcium carbonate (93847). The calcium products were used in combination subcutaneous teriparatide and oral vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 1000 IU daily.\nless\nRefeeding syndrome.

Phosphate deficiencies are rare (93857). For athletic performance, sodium phosphate has most often been used in doses of 4 grams or 50 mg/kg of fat-free mass, taken in four divided doses daily, for 6 days prior to exercise. For bowel preparation, prescription tablets containing sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous are taken in divided doses the evening and morning before colonoscopy, for a total of approximately 48 grams of sodium phosphate. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTaking supplemental phosphate salts in combination with phosphate-containing foods, such as cola, wine, beer, whole grain cereals, nuts, dairy products, and some meats, may increase phosphate levels and the risk of adverse effects, especially in individuals with kidney disease (88147).\nIntravenous:\nIntravenous sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription products. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of phosphate (expressed as phosphorus) are based on age as follows: 1-3 years old, 460 mg; 4-8 years old, 500 mg; 9-18 years old, 1250 mg (3094). The adequate intakes (AI) for infants are 100 mg for 0-6 months of age and 275 mg for 7-12 months of age (7555).\nStandardization & Formulation\nMonobasic, dibasic, or tribasic phosphate salts have been used in clinical trials.

Patients should separate calcium and phosphate intake by at least 2 hours.\nless\nIRON\nTaking phosphate with iron can reduce the absorption of both iron and phosphate.\nIron and phosphate interact in the gut to form insoluble precipitates. This effect seems to be increased in the presence of calcium, which can stabilize the precipitate (14591, 14592). Phosphates might also increase oxidation of ferrous iron to the ferric form, which is less well absorbed (14592). Foods containing both phosphates and calcium can reduce iron absorption by 27% to 47% (14591, 14592). Phosphate depletion from iron administration has occurred in animal models (14588, 14593).

Antacids are sometimes used therapeutically to decrease high phosphate levels in people with chronic kidney disease. In people with normal kidney function, use of higher-than-recommended doses of antacids for prolonged periods (e.g. over 100 mL daily of Maalox for several months, or 30 mL daily for over 10 years) can cause hypophosphatemia, potentially leading to osteomalacia, fractures, nephrolithiasis, and ureter obstruction (3371, 4400, 8878, 11503).\nless\nCHOLESTYRAMINE (Questran)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, taking cholestyramine might increase the risk of hypophosphatemia and associated adverse effects; cholestyramine and phosphate intake should be separated by at least 2 hours.\nCholestyramine can bind phosphate in the gut. It also reduces absorption of vitamin D which normally acts to increase gastrointestinal absorption and kidney reabsorption of phosphate (4455). There are reports of reduced serum phosphate levels, and occasional hypophosphatemia, in people taking large doses of cholestyramine for more than a year. Cholestyramine doses of 0.2-1.1 grams/kg daily in children and 12-16 grams daily in adults have been associated with reduced phosphate levels (4455, 5838). However, most people taking cholestyramine are unlikely to need phosphate supplements unless their dietary intake is low.\nless\nCOLESTIPOL (Colestid)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, taking colestipol might increase the risk of hypophosphatemia and associated adverse effects; colestipol and phosphate intake should be separated by at least 2 hours.\nColestipol can bind phosphate in the gut.

However, occasional or short-term use of mineral oil isn't likely to have a clinically significant effect on phosphate levels.\nless\nNIACIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, niacin might increase the risk of hypophosphatemia; niacin and phosphate intake should be separated by at least 2 hours.\nThere is some evidence that niacin reduces plasma phosphate levels by interfering with active transport in the intestine. In people with metabolic syndrome and hyperlipidemia, taking slow-release prescription niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Labs) 2 grams orally daily for 8 weeks reduced plasma phosphate levels by approximately 15% (88146).

Doses of 6-17 grams daily have been used to reduce elevated phosphate levels in patients with kidney failure (14594, 14595). In people with normal kidney function, there is a risk of hypophosphatemia if large doses of 6 grams daily or more are used for prolonged periods (14595).\nless\nTERIPARATIDE (Forteo)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTaking teriparatide reduces phosphate levels in the blood for about 2 hours; however, this reduction is transient.\nTeriparatide is a fragment of human parathyroid hormone which increases urinary phosphate excretion and decreases serum phosphate similarly to the naturally occurring hormone (8821). After a single dose of teriparatide, serum phosphate levels fall for about 2 hours and then recover to baseline (14590). This recovery also seems to continue even with several years of treatment, with patients having either no change in serum phosphate levels, or a small decrease which remains within the normal range (14596, 14597, 14598, 14599).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere is a case of permanent brain damage related to phosphate toxicity associated with use of a sodium phosphate enema as a laxative in a child (93866). There are also three cases of death related to phosphate toxicity associated with use of over-the-counter sodium phosphate as a laxative in infants. In two cases, sodium phosphate was given as an enema, in one of these cases at 4 times the adult dosage. A third case involved accidental intake of 11 mmol sodium phosphate orally (93866). Death has also been reported in elderly patients using sodium phosphate enemas, mainly at standard doses of 250 mL (93867).\nTreatment\nHyperphosphatemia is treated as needed with dietary phosphate restriction, phosphate binders, saline diuresis, and/or hemodialysis (107009). Details on the management of hyperphosphatemia can be found in various medical guidelines.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nNormally, about 60% to 70% of dietary phosphate is absorbed in to the plasma from the small intestine (93857). Phosphates present in dairy products and meats are soluble and readily absorbed, whereas those in cereal grains are bound and insoluble, and may be poorly absorbed. Phosphate deficiencies are rare (3092, 93857). Phosphorus absorption from the gut is partially regulated by vitamin D3, which plays a role in maintaining blood levels of both calcium and phosphorus (3092, 3372, 8821). Inadequate dietary phosphate lowers serum phosphate levels, which are inversely related to serum calcium levels (3372, 8821).\nDistribution\nIn adults, phosphorus makes up from 0.65 % to 1.1% of the body, with 85% of phosphorus found in bone. Normal plasma concentrations range from 2.5-5 mg/dL. It is also present in the soft tissue in carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and various enzymes involved in energy transfer (7555).\nExcretion\nVitamin D3 and its metabolites influence renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Vitamin D plays a role in maintaining optimal blood levels of phosphorus. Regulating excretion of phosphorus is one method of control (3092, 3372, 8821).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPhosphate is the most common form of phosphorus (7555). It is the most abundant intracellular anion in the body. It is critical for membrane structure, transport, and energy storage (3092). Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and some meats (7555). Phosphate deficiencies are rare (3092, 93857). Cola drinks contain significant amounts of phosphate, and excessive intake can result in hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia (7555). Most supplements that list phosphorus as an ingredient actually contain phosphate salts.\n\nPhosphate plays an important role in buffering body fluids, and plays a primary role in the renal excretion of hydrogen ions. It is present in carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and various enzymes involved in energy transfer (7555).\nAcidifying effects\nOral ingestion of large amounts of sodium dihydrogen phosphate can lower urine pH (1).\nCalcium effects\nPhosphate salts are a source of phosphate and can be used to prevent and treat hypophosphatemia (15). Hypophosphatemia causes an increase in intestinal calcium absorption and increased calcium in the blood. This can inhibit formation of new bone (3372, 8821) and potentially lead to a greater risk of renal calcium stone formation (3372).\nErgogenic effects\nSome clinical research shows that phosphate salts can improve exercise performance (88150, 93843, 93844, 93857, 93858, 93859); however, not all clinical research has shown benefit (8301, 93849, 93854, 93855, 93856, 107007). Phosphate salts have been shown to increase levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in red blood cells, thus allowing for increased oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Increased phosphate levels could also increase levels of hydrogen phosphate resulting in improved buffering capacity. Other possibilities include an improvement in the function of the heart muscle, a greater production of ATP and phosphocreatine, and increased activation of some intermediates of metabolic cycles. These possible mechanisms of action have not been confirmed in human research (93837, 93843).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSodium phosphates are used as saline laxatives. They cause influx of fluids in the intestine by an osmotic action and increase peristalsis (15)."

A pooled analysis of 3 small randomized clinical trials in adults with chronic, active, ulcerative colitis at a single site shows that taking this specific form of phosphatidylcholine 1-4 grams daily for 3 months increases the odds of achieving clinical remission by 9.7 times when compared with placebo. Overall, 49% of the patients taking phosphatidylcholine achieved clinical remission. Taking phosphatidylcholine also improved quality of life and clinical improvement scores. In one study, this product also decreased the need for steroids, resulting in complete withdrawal of steroid therapy without exacerbation of disease in 80% of patients (93390). However, most patients in these studies were not treated with other standard therapies for ulcerative colitis, such as immunosuppressants and aminosalicylic acids. Subgroup analyses by dose suggest that the effective dose of this product is at least 1 gram daily; however, taking 3-4 grams daily may be more effective (93389, 105728).\n\nIn patients not responsive to mesalamine, some preliminary clinical research suggests taking LT-02 (Lipid Therapeutics GmbH), a modified-release formula of phosphatidylcholine, 3.2 grams daily for 12 weeks, improves symptoms of ulcerative colitis.

It is unclear if subcutaneous phosphatidylcholine is beneficial in patients with periorbital fat pad herniation.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that injecting phosphatidylcholine 20 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks markedly reduces lower eyelid fat pads in people with bulging fat pads due to herniation when compared to baseline. In some people, benefits appeared to last for a period of 9 months to 2 years or longer (15623, 15628).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). Although there has been interest in using oral phosphatidylcholine for PAD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of phosphatidylcholine for this purpose.\nPeritoneal dialysis.

The phospholipids were encapsulated with Eudragit S 100 (1:1 wt/wt) (68839, 93389, 93390). In another clinical trial, phosphatidylcholine was used as a source of choline. Each capsule of PhosChol (Nutrasal) contained 833 mg phosphatidylcholine of which approximately 15%, or 125 mg, was choline (93386).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with phosphatidylcholine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, phosphatidylcholine is absorbed rapidly and reaches maximum serum concentrations in 8-12 hours (15626, 68842). Animal research suggests that phosphatidylcholine is able to penetrate the epidermis upon topical application (68834).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPhosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid and a major component of lecithin. Lecithin-derived phosphatidylcholine can be generated from many plants including soy, sunflower, and mustard. It can also come from eggs (4914, 16621). Egg lecithin contains 69% phosphatidylcholine, while soybean lecithin contains 24% phosphatidylcholine (4914). The phosphatidylcholine molecule consists of a head group called phosphorylcholine which connects to a middle component called glycerol, which connects to two fatty acid tails. These fatty acid tails can vary (15621).\nFat absorption effects\nThe hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by pancreatic phospholipase A2 plays a direct role in regulating the absorption of certain lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins (8808).\nFat breakdown effects\nPhosphatidylcholine is used for removing vascular fat deposits and cosmetically for reducing subcutaneous fatty tissue. Phosphatidylcholine is thought to act as a detergent which causes lysis of fat cell membranes resulting in cell breakdown (15621). However, phosphatidylcholine is often solubilized using deoxycholate, which also acts as a detergent. Some researchers speculate that it is actually the deoxycholate and not the phosphatidylcholine that is the main active lipolytic agent. Some evidence shows that deoxycholate alone can reduce lipoma mass (15624). Other researchers suggest that both phosphatidylcholine and deoxycholate can break down or burst the adipocytes, but that only phosphatidylcholine can emulsify the broken down fat particles and facilitate dissolution of fat and transport to the liver for metabolism (15626).\nGastrointestinal effects\nLaboratory research suggests that phosphatidylcholine is found in colonic mucus and plays a role in the protection of the colon. Patients with decreased mucosal phosphatidylcholine levels have a reduced hydrophobic barrier. This might result in increased need for immune response, as well as inflammation and ulceration (93387, 93389). In animal research, phosphatidylcholine played a key role in mucosal defense in the gastrointestinal system and, when applied topically to the colon, has been shown to protect laboratory animals against experimentally induced colitis (68837). Preliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis also shows that taking a slow-release phosphatidylcholine-rich phospholipid product 1-4 grams daily for 3 months improves histological and endoscopic disease scores when compared with placebo (105728).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine might provide protection against liver fibrosis and alcohol induced oxidative stress, although the exact mechanisms are not completely understood (8809). In animal and in vitro models, polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine has been shown to protect against various types of experimental liver damage (68836, 68838, 68841). Animal research suggests that phosphatidylcholine is incorporated into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes, thereby improving the morphology, fluidity, and function of the membrane (5224, 5225).\nNeurological effects\nPhosphatidylcholine is the largest reservoir of choline in the body (15626). Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine (5228). Acetylcholine is thought to be involved in memory. Since phosphatidylcholine might increase acetylcholine, there is interest in using it for improving memory and for conditions such as dementia. However, it is not clear if taking phosphatidylcholine by mouth leads to increased acetylcholine levels. In animals with adequate acetylcholine levels, phosphatidylcholine supplementation does not increase acetylcholine; however, it might increase acetylcholine in animals with dementia and low acetylcholine levels. Furthermore, in animals with low cholinergic activity due to administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine and scopolamine, phosphatidylcholine has been shown to both increase and have no effect on acetylcholine levels (103716, 103717, 103718)."

It is a component of the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane where it is most concentrated on the inner surface (68853, 89498, 91463). Phosphatidylserine is also found in high quantities in the brain, especially in myelin (2437, 91463).",
            "Warnings": "Most phosphatidylserine supplements used to be derived from bovine cortex, leading to concern about possible contamination from sick or diseased animals, including those harboring bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease). So far, there are no reports of BSE or other disease transmission to humans from dietary supplements containing animal materials, and the risk of potential disease transmission is thought to be low. However, because of this concern, most manufacturers now derive phosphatidylserine from soy or cabbage. Soy-derived phosphatidylserine has been used in clinical trials (89498).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Phosphatidylserine has been used with apparent safety at dose of up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months (2255, 2437, 2438, 2439, 2440, 2441, 7118, 15539, 68855).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term (7117). Phosphatidylserine has been used with apparent safety in clinical research in doses of 200-300 mg daily for up to 4 months in children aged 4-18 years (7117, 89498).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral bovine cortex-derived phosphatidylserine seems to improve attention and memory in patients with age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if plant-derived phosphatidylserine is beneficial or whether phosphatidylserine is beneficial for preventing cognitive decline.\nClinical studies in people with age-related cognitive decline show that phosphatidylserine improves attention, arousal, verbal fluency, and memory (2440, 2441, 7119, 7120, 15539). Bovine- and plant-sourced phosphatidylserine 100 mg three times daily for up to 6 months has been used in these studies (2440, 2441, 15539). Most clinical studies have used phosphatidylserine derived from bovine cortex. However, most supplements now use soy- or cabbage-derived phosphatidylserine. There is some preliminary evidence that plant-derived phosphatidylserine also improves memory in people with age-associated memory impairment (15539). Also, clinical research in elderly females with complaints of memory loss shows that taking 1-3 capsules of a specific product (Vayacog, Enzymotec Ltd.) containing soybean-derived phosphatidylserine 100 mg/capsule, enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 19.5 mg/capsule and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 6.5 mg/capsule, daily for 15 weeks modestly improves immediate memory and sustained attention when compared with placebo (66055, 90711). A post-hoc analysis of the results from this study suggests that cognitive improvements are greatest in patients with relatively good cognitive performance at baseline (66055).\n\nThere is also interest in using phosphatidylserine to prevent age-related cognitive decline. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline. However, the FDA has determined that there is very little scientific evidence supporting this claim (102363).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral bovine cortex-derived phosphatidylserine seems to improve cognitive function and behavior in patients with Alzheimer disease when used for up to 12 weeks, although benefits may disappear after 16 weeks. It is unclear if plant-derived phosphatidylserine is beneficial.\nTaking phosphatidylserine orally can improve cognitive function and global improvement rating scales and improve behavioral rating scales over 6-12 weeks of treatment (2255, 2437, 2438, 2439, 7114, 7118). Bovine-sourced phosphatidylserine 300-400 mg in divided doses daily for up to 16 weeks has been used (2255, 2437, 2438, 2439). Phosphatidylserine seems to be most effective in patients with less severe symptoms (2437, 2439). Phosphatidylserine might lose its effectiveness with extended use. After 16 weeks of treatment, progression of Alzheimer disease seems to overcome any benefit of phosphatidylserine (2255).\n\nMost clinical studies have used phosphatidylserine derived from bovine cortex. However, most supplements now use soy- or cabbage-derived phosphatidylserine. Clinical studies have not yet evaluated phosphatidylserine from soy or other sources. It is not known if phosphatidylserine from these sources is as effective as bovine-derived products.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral phosphatidylserine is beneficial for athletic performance.\nOne small clinical trial in golfers shows that taking nutritional bars containing phosphatidylserine 200 mg daily for 6 weeks improves the number of good ball flights, which may improve golf score; however, perceived stress levels and heart rate are not significantly affected (68855). A clinical study in recreationally active adults shows that taking phosphatidylserine 400 mg and caffeine 100 mg daily, along with niacin 28 mg, vitamin C 60 mg, vitamin B1 1.5 mg, vitamin B5 10 mg, vitamin B6 2 mg, vitamin E 12 IU, calcium 100 mg, magnesium 40 mg, and carbohydrates in the form of evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, and rice syrup solids 16 grams (Nutravail Technologies) for 14 days modestly reduces post-exercise mood disturbances and perception of fatigue when compared with vitamins and minerals alone. The combination does not appear to improve cognitive function or reaction time (91463). It is not clear if the effect of the combination supplement is due to phosphatidylserine, caffeine, or the combination.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral phosphatidylserine is beneficial for ADHD.\nA meta-analysis of three generally low-quality randomized clinical trials shows that taking phosphatidylserine 200-300 mg daily for 8-15 weeks modestly improves symptoms of inattention in children with ADHD when compared with placebo. However, there were no significant effects on hyperactivity-impulsivity or on overall ADHD symptoms. Also, two of the three clinical trials included in the analysis investigated the effects of phosphatidylserine in combination with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (105247). One preliminary clinical trial included in the analysis shows that taking soy-derived phosphatidylserine 200 mg daily for 2 months improves ADHD symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and short-term memory, when compared to baseline in treatment-naïve children with ADHD aged 4-14 years. However, results from this study are limited due to a lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group (89498).\nless\nCognitive function. Although there is interest in using oral phosphatidylserine for improving cognitive function in healthy adults, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of phosphatidylserine for this purpose.\nDementia. It is unclear if oral phosphatidylserine is beneficial for dementia prevention or treatment.\nIn 2003, the FDA determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly. However, the FDA has determined that there is very little scientific evidence supporting this claim (102363).\nless\nDepression.

It is unclear if oral phosphatidylserine is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nOne small clinical study in athletes shows that taking soybean-derived phosphatidylserine 800 mg daily for 2 weeks during periods of over-training reduces muscle soreness post-exercise when compared with those not taking phosphatidylserine (2264).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate phosphatidylserine for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPhosphatidylserine is a fat-soluble phospholipid that occurs endogenously in humans. It is the most abundant phospholipid in the human brain and is important in neuronal membrane functions such as maintenance of the cell's internal environment, signal transduction, secretory vesicle release, cell-to-cell communication, and cell growth regulation (2437, 7115). Phosphatidylserine is also a component of the mitochondrial membrane, where it might function as a metabolic reservoir for other phospholipids (7121). Although the body is able to synthesize phosphatidylserine through an elaborate series of reactions and substantial energy expenditure, the body obtains most phosphatidylserine from dietary sources. Phosphatidylserine is present in small quantities in most foods (7116). However, the phosphatidylserine in the body does not contain the same fatty acids as the phosphatidylserine consumed, due to removal and addition of various fatty acids during digestion (7121).\nAnti-stress effects\nThere is interest in phosphatidylserine for decreasing exercise-induced and mental task-induced stress. Some preliminary evidence shows that phosphatidylserine might blunt the rise in cortisol and adrenocorticotropin following strenuous exercise training (2264, 8851, 8852). Also, very preliminary clinical research shows that phosphatidylserine 300 mg per day might improve mood and subjective feelings of stress during a mental stress test (11963).\nCardiovascular effects\nEvidence shows that high levels of procoagulant endothelial particles containing phosphatidylserine are present in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Although these increased levels are hypothesized to contribute to plaque disruption and thrombosis, the exact mechanisms are not yet understood (8855). Other research suggests that membrane bilayer flip-flopping, resulting in phosphatidylserine on the outside membrane of the cell, may be responsible for the procoagulation of the sickle cell (68866, 68867, 68869, 68872).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nIn animal models of multiple sclerosis, phosphatidylserine reduces tremor, spasticity, and urinary incontinence, possibly by suppressing the release of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (8853, 8854).\nNeurologic effects\nIt is not clear how phosphatidylserine works for dementia such as Alzheimer's disease and age-related memory impairment. However, one theory is that patients with dementia or age-related memory impairment have structural or functional abnormalities in neuronal membranes that cause changes in neurotransmitter functioning. People with cognitive dysfunction often have changes in acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels. Some researchers think the abnormal neuronal function can be attributed to changes in lipid composition of the brain. It is thought that exogenous administration of phosphatidylserine might then normalize brain lipid content and return neuronal function to normal (2441, 68868). Phosphatidylserine has been shown to increase acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine levels in animal models and patients with Alzheimer's disease (2437, 8857, 8858).\n\nIn animal models, levels of phosphatidylserine in the brain decline with age (15539). In animal models, phosphatidylserine improves spatial memory and passive avoidance (8858). Phosphatidylserine also appears to minimize age-related neuronal dendrite loss and atrophy of cholinergic neurons (2437, 8857). The fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is readily present in neuronal cells, appears to further promote the accumulation of phosphatidylserine in cell membranes, which in turn prevents apoptotic cell death (8857)."

    "Phytase": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Phytase is an enzyme that removes phosphate from phytic acid or phytate (101901, 101910). It is found naturally in small amounts in the diet, in microorganisms and plants, and in the small intestine (101901, 101904, 101907, 101912). Dietary phytate can bind to minerals and reduce their bioavailability. Therefore, supplemental phytase is sometimes used to break down dietary phytate (101909).\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nSometimes used to increase the absorption of calcium, iron, and zinc from food, but there is insufficient reliable information to rate its effectiveness for any use.\nLikely safe when consumed in amounts naturally found in food.

            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, no adverse effects have been reported. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted. Workplace immunological responses to airborne powdered phytase have been reported (101901, 101908, 101909, 101910).\nImmunologic\nThere are numerous reports of immunologic responses to airborne powdered phytase in the animal-feed industry (101901, 101908, 101909, 101910). Examples of reactions include allergic occupational asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (101901, 101908). In one case report of a 43-year-old male, hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to phytase was diagnosed following a 6-month history of coughing, shortness of breath, fever, and dyspnea (101908). In an analysis of 53 people occupationally exposed to phytase, 28% had IgE antibodies and 45% had IgG antibodies specific to phytase. Symptoms included dyspnea, rhinitis, and eye and skin reactions (101909). In another analysis of patients with IgE-mediated occupational respiratory allergy, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, and asthmatic symptoms were reported (101910).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. In patients with deep wrinkles, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc citrate 50 mg and phytase 3,000 units daily for four days prior to a botulinum toxin treatment increases the patient-reported duration of botulinum toxin effects by approximately 25%, compared with no improvement in patients taking zinc gluconate 10 mg or placebo. The efficacy of botulinum treatment was also improved (101913). Whether this reported benefit is due to the dose or form of zinc, citrate, phytase, the combination, or other factors, is unclear (101913, 101914).\nBlepharospasm. In patients with blepharospasm, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc citrate 50 mg and phytase 3,000 units daily for four days prior to a botulinum toxin treatment increases the patient-reported duration of botulinum toxin effects by approximately 25%, compared with no improvement in patients taking zinc gluconate 10 mg or placebo. The efficacy of botulinum treatment was also improved (101913). Whether this reported benefit is due to the dose or form of zinc, citrate, phytase, the combination, or other factors, is unclear (101913, 101914).\nChild growth. Clinical research in infants consuming a corn-based diet shows that taking a fat- and micronutrient-based food supplement containing phytase, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid, and lysine increases linear growth at age 8 and 10 months and improves locomotor development when compared with not taking this supplement. In contrast, a similar fat- and micronutrient-based supplement without phytase, DHA, arachidonic acid, and lysine does not improve these indices when compared with not taking a supplement. The phytase-containing supplement did not affect linear growth, weight for age, or hand-eye coordination at 12 months (101902). These reported benefits to child growth are likely to be due to the combination of provided essential and non-essential nutrients. Any role of phytase is expected to be minimal.\nIron deficiency anemia. Taking phytase with a meal containing phytate and iron increases iron absorption (101903, 101904, 101906). However, the effect of phytase specifically for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia remains unclear (101902).\nPhytase is sometimes added to the diet to increase the absorption of iron from food. In a small study of women, some with iron deficiency anemia, incubating wheat as a source of phytase with a traditional grain high in phytate increased iron absorption from the meal to 8.3% from 2.6% (101904). Also, adding microbial phytase to whole wheat rolls containing phytate increases iron absorption from a meal by approximately 82% when compared with rolls without added phytase (101906). In another small study, the addition of a microbial phytase to a single corn meal with added micronutrients increases iron absorption and incorporation into red blood cells after 14 days by 1.85-fold when compared with the meal without added phytase (101903). However, consuming white wheat rolls with added wheat bran as a source of phytase does not increase iron absorption from the meal when compared to consuming rolls with added wheat bran with deactivated phytase (101906).\n\nThe use of phytase as treatment for iron deficiency, with or without anemia, has rarely been investigated. However, clinical research in infants consuming a corn-based diet shows that taking a fat- and micronutrient-based food supplement containing phytase, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid, and lysine for 6 months does not seem to be more effective for reducing anemia than taking the food supplement without phytase (101902).\nless\nZinc deficiency.

Phytase is present in the small intestine of animals; however, in the human intestine, phytase activity is low (101907). Phytase, a 6-phytase, is found in some cereals, legumes, and oilseeds. High activities are found in wheat bran. Soaking, germinating, and fermenting increase the activation of grain, legume, and seed phytases (101904, 101912). Sources of supplemental phytase, usually 3-phytase, include microorganisms such as Aspergillus niger (101909).\nMineral availability effects\nDietary phytate or phytic acid binds to minerals and reduces their bioavailability. Phytase breaks down dietary phytate by catalyzing the stepwise removal of phosphates from phytate (101901), increasing the release of the chelated minerals (101909). Microbial phytases are active at a pH of 2.0 and are resistant to heat and stomach acid (101901, 101905). The endogenous phytases in food are generally active at a pH of 4.5-6.0 and a temperature range of 45-60° C. Soaking food sources of phytase at the appropriate temperature range has a significant effect on the bioavailability of minerals (101904, 101905, 101906, 101907). Fermentation with phytase-producing microorganisms also increases the bioavailability of minerals (101912)."

            "Overview": "Piracetam is a synthetic chemical in the family of nootropic chemicals known as racetams (95170). Piracetam was synthesized as a derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the 1960s (95173). It is available by prescription in Europe. However, it is not approved as either a drug or dietary supplement in the United States (95170).",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBreath-holding attacks. Clinical research shows that oral piracetam reduces breath-holding attacks in children 6 months to 6 years of age.\nClinical research in children 6-36 months of age with a history of severe breath-holding attacks shows that taking piracetam orally 40 mg/kg daily for 2-3 months results in complete resolution of breath holding attacks in 77% to 92% of patients, compared to 6% to 30% of those taking placebo (95206, 95207). A small clinical study in children aged 0.5-6 years with at least 3 breath-holding attacks monthly, or with seizure-like movement or loss of consciousness during attacks, shows that taking piracetam 100 mg/kg orally daily for 3 months reduces the frequency of attacks by at least 50% in 77% of patients when compared to baseline. These results were similar to taking levetiracetam 40 mg/kg daily (109538).\n\nPiracetam has also been studied in combination with other products. Clinical research in children 5 months to 6 years of age with breath holding attacks shows that taking piracetam 100 mg/kg orally daily in addition to docosahexaenoic acid 150 mg/kg orally daily for six months increased the proportion of patients with complete resolution of breath-holding attacks when compared with piracetam alone. These results were not observed at earlier follow-up time periods (1 month, 3 month) (112748).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Small clinical trials show oral and intravenous piracetam leads to modest improvements in certain cognitive outcomes after CABG.\nA meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials shows that intravenous administration of piracetam 12 grams as a single dose prior to surgery improves cognitive performance following CABG surgery. Improvements occurred in both immediate and delayed recall of pictures and words (95174). Another small clinical study shows that intravenous administration of piracetam starting the day before CABG surgery and continuing until 6 days after surgery, followed by piracetam 12 grams orally daily for 6 weeks does not improve neuropsychologic test scores when compared with placebo. However, some subgroup analyses showed improvement with piracetam (95175).\nless\nDyslexia. Small clinical trials show that taking oral piracetam modestly improves reading ability in children with dyslexia.\nClinical research shows that taking piracetam 3.3 grams orally daily improves some, but not all, reading skills in children aged 7-14 years when taken for at least 12 weeks (95183, 95184), but not when taken for less than 12 weeks (95201) when compared with placebo. Taking piracetam for 36 weeks improves reading ability by 23% to 51% on various oral reading tests compared with improvements of 11% to 33% with placebo (95183). Taking piracetam for 12 weeks also improved the speed of reading by an average of 2.8 words per minute when compared with placebo. This was most apparent in males with the poorest scores at baseline. However, there was no improvement in reading accuracy or comprehension (95184).\nless\nEpilepsy. Small clinical trials show that taking oral piracetam can reduce some symptoms of myoclonus epilepsy due to various causes in patients who are on stable drug treatment regimens.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy shows that taking piracetam 24 grams orally daily for 2 weeks reduces symptoms of myoclonus by 21% when compared with placebo. Lower doses of 9.6 or 16.8 grams demonstrated reduced effectiveness (95181). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking piracetam up to 20 grams orally daily for 18 months reduces overall symptoms by 22% when compared with baseline, with motor impairment experiencing the most significant improvements (95182). The extent of these improvements and the nature of the benefits obtained might vary in respect to the etiology of the disease and the severity of symptoms at baseline.\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. Small clinical trials show that oral piracetam can reduce some symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.\nClinical research in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients taking neuroleptic medications shows that taking piracetam 2.4 grams twice daily orally for 4 weeks improves symptoms of tardive dyskinesia by 39% when compared with placebo. Improvements occurred in 67% of patients taking piracetam, compared to 24% of patients taking placebo (95178). Other preliminary clinical research shows that giving piracetam intravenously at doses of 8-24 grams daily also reduces dyskinesia symptoms associated with neuroleptic medications when compared with placebo (95178).\nless\nVertigo. Small clinical trials show that intravenous and oral piracetam improves some symptoms of vertigo.\nClinical research in patients with acute vertigo shows that intravenous administration of piracetam 1-2 grams once decreases symptoms by 33% to 68% when compared with baseline. Piracetam was as effective as intravenous dimenhydrinate (95176, 95200). Additional clinical research in patients with acute vertigo shows that taking piracetam 800 mg orally three times daily for 7 days after discharge from the emergency department is as effective as the anti-vertigo medication betahistine for reducing vertigo intensity and improving symptoms of nausea and fatigue (100997). Other clinical research in patients with chronic vertigo lasting at least 3 months shows that taking piracetam 800 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks moderately reduces the frequency, but not the severity, of vertigo episodes (95247). In patients with chronic vertigo lasting at least 3 months, some clinical research shows that taking piracetam 800 mg three times daily for 8 weeks moderately reduces the frequency, but not the severity, of vertigo episodes when compared with placebo (95247).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with age-related cognitive decline.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in adults with cognitive dysfunction shows that taking piracetam three times daily improves memory by 17% when compared with baseline (95167). The available research shows that for one individual to benefit clinically, approximately four people had to receive piracetam at a dose of 2.4-8 grams daily for 6-52 weeks. However, the available clinical research was performed between 1972 and 2001, and included diagnoses ranging from mild age-related cognitive decline to degenerative dementia (95173). High quality clinical research in clearly defined populations is needed to determine if piracetam is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease shows that taking piracetam 8 grams orally daily for one year does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo, although there may be a small delay in cognitive deterioration (95246).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral piracetam for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with autism spectrum disorder.\nOne small clinical study in children with autism spectrum disorder aged 3-11 years shows that taking piracetam up to 800 mg orally daily with risperidone 2-3 mg daily for 10 weeks improves overall symptoms of autism by 51%, compared to 21% in those taking risperidone and placebo (95205).\nless\nCerebellar ataxia. Although there has been interest in using oral piracetam for cerebellar ataxia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with cocaine dependence.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with cocaine dependence shows that taking piracetam 2.4 grams twice daily for 10 weeks increases cocaine use when compared with placebo. When compared with placebo, 40% fewer patients taking piracetam completed the trial without relapse and 55% fewer patients reported any improvement (95177).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with dementia.\nA meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research shows that piracetam might be beneficial in some adults with dementia. The available research shows that for one individual to benefit clinically, approximately four people had to receive piracetam at a dose of 2.4-8 grams orally daily for 6-52 weeks. However, the available clinical research was performed between 1972 and 2001, and included diagnoses ranging from mild age-related cognitive decline to degenerative dementia (95173). High quality clinical research in clearly defined populations is needed to determine if piracetam is beneficial for dementia.\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral piracetam for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nDown syndrome. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with Down syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small group of children with Down syndrome shows that taking piracetam 80-100 mg/kg orally daily in three divided doses for 4 months does not improve overall cognitive performance when compared with placebo. Furthermore, use of piracetam might increase neurological side effects such as aggression and irritability (95180).\nless\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using oral piracetam for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nHearing loss. Intravenous piracetam has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that intravenous administration of piracetam and steroids might improve hearing in patients that have undergone acute acoustic trauma due to gunshots. Administering undefine doses of piracetam intravenously, in addition to intravenous prednisolone, within the first hour of acoustic trauma resulted in complete recovery at one month in 65% of patients compared with 23% or fewer patients who received the treatment more than an hour after the trauma (95204).\nless\nMemory. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial for memory.\nA meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials shows that taking piracetam for up to 1 year does not improve memory when compared with placebo (115656). The validity of this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of populations in the included studies, including patients with cognitive decline or dementia, patients undergoing surgery, and patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy. Doses used in the available research have ranged from 1.6 to 24 grams daily (95209, 115656).\nless\nNocturnal enuresis. Although there has been interest in using oral piracetam for nocturnal enuresis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with Parkinson disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking piracetam up to 4.8 grams orally daily for 24 weeks does not improve symptom scores when compared with placebo (95208).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial for postoperative recovery.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that administering piracetam 12 grams as a single dose intravenously at the beginning of the surgery does not improve cognitive performance scores when compared with placebo (95179).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with schizophrenia shows that taking piracetam 3.2 grams orally daily with haloperidol 30 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces some symptoms of schizophrenia, especially positive symptom scores, when compared with haloperidol alone (95202).\nless\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral or intravenous piracetam is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 3-12 years shows administration of piracetam intravenously daily during a sickle cell crisis, followed by piracetam 160 mg/kg orally daily, reduces the severity of the crisis by at least 50% in all patients, compared to no change or an increase in severity in those taking placebo (95197). Other preliminary clinical research in children aged 4-15 years shows that taking piracetam 80 mg/kg orally daily for 5 months decreases the number of monthly sickle cell crises by 52% when compared with placebo (95198). However, these studies were small with poor methodological quality.\nless\nStatin-induced myalgia. Oral piracetam has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adult males taking simvastatin 40 mg daily shows that taking piracetam 800 mg orally along with L-carnitine 1 gram orally daily for 35 days moderately reduces pain and discomfort scores after an exercise test when compared with placebo (106549). It is unclear if these effects are due to piracetam, L-carnitine, or the combination. Also, the validity of this finding is limited by the single-blinded nature of the study.\nless\nStroke. Given the low-quality and inconclusive findings in the available clinical research, it is unclear which stroke patients, if any, might benefit from oral piracetam.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients who have had a recent ischemic stroke shows that taking piracetam 1.6 grams orally three times daily for up to 2 years is as effective as taking aspirin 200 mg three times daily for preventing a second episode (95203). However, meta-analyses of available clinical research shows that piracetam does not prevent death or improve functional outcomes in patients who have had a stroke (95193, 95194). Furthermore, preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that piracetam might increase the risk for death in the patients with the most severe symptoms at baseline (95193).\n\nA meta-analysis of mainly small, randomized trials including post-stroke patients also shows that taking piracetam 4.8 grams orally daily for up to 24 weeks does not improve the severity of aphasia with respect to repetition, naming, or comprehension when compared with placebo. However, written language is improved by a small to moderate amount when compared with placebo (95191).\n\nIn contrast, one observational study in Vietnamese patients with acute ischemic stroke suggests that intravenous administration of piracetam (Nootropil, Nang Kuang Pharma) 1 gram every 8 hours for 3 days is associated with lower scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge in certain subgroups of patients, such as males, ex-smokers, patients 75 years of age and older, patients with hypertension or dyslipidemia, and patients without diabetes or atrial fibrillation (100998).\nless\nTinnitus. Although there has been interest in using intravenous piracetam for tinnitus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of piracetam for this purpose.\nVascular dementia. It is unclear if oral piracetam is beneficial in patients with vascular dementia.\nA small nonrandomized, unblinded clinical study in older adults with post-infarction vascular dementia shows that taking piracetam along with nimodipine improves end-of-treatment cognitive function, activities of daily living, and quality of life scores when compared with taking nimodipine alone (106550). The poor study methodology and undisclosed dosing strategy limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate piracetam for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with piracetam.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral intake, piracetam can be found in the blood within 30-90 minutes with a bioavailability of approximately 100%. Peak plasma levels occur after approximately 0.5-2.3 hours (95185, 95186, 95248).\nDistribution\nFollowing oral intake, piracetam is rapidly distributed throughout the body and can cross the blood-brain barrier (95185, 95186). The half-life in plasma is approximately 5 hours (95185, 95186, 95248). The half-life of piracetam in the brain is approximately 7.7 hours (95178, 95185).\nMetabolism\nFollowing oral intake, piracetam does not undergo metabolism (95185).\nExcretion\nFollowing oral intake, piracetam is excreted unchanged in urine approximately 30 hours after intake. Very small amounts are excreted in feces (95185).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPiracetam is a synthetic, water-soluble cyclic derivative of the hormone, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, it is generally accepted that the activity of piracetam is not related to the activity of GABA (95186).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nPiracetam is used for some types of seizures. This is based on anticonvulsant effects found in animal research. Piracetam seems to enhance the anticonvulsant effects of some medications, such as carbamazepine and diazepam. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, piracetam likely facilitates neurotransmission (95186).\nBinge eating disorder-related effects\nSome animal research suggests that piracetam may have some effects on binge eating disorder (BED). In a rat model of BED, piracetam attenuated binge eating-associated behavior, anxiety, and weight gain. Additionally, piracetam modulated various hormones and neurotransmitters that were altered by binge eating. Specifically, piracetam decreased leptin levels, increased ghrelin levels, and regulated glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin levels in various parts of the brain, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are involved in piracetam's effect on binge eating behavior (100999).\nNeurological effects\nPiracetam is thought to have more than one mechanism of action related to its neurological effects. Piracetam seems to affect membrane fluidity and prevent membrane fusion. The fluidity of the cell membrane is important for protein activity and the activity of membrane transport. Some scientists suggest that piracetam influences membrane fluidity by inducing the reorganization of membrane lipids. This might protect against lipid disorganization that occurs during dementia, including Alzheimer disease, or even normal aging. Animal research suggests that improving membrane fluidity in an aging model improves learning (95186, 95187).\n\nIn the brain, piracetam seems to improve blood circulation and oxygen supply by increasing deformability of red blood cells and improving the metabolism of glucose in the brain (95177, 95179, 95181). Improvement in membrane function improves energy metabolism of cells in the brain (95170). Piracetam also has antioxidant effects, possibly neutralizing the damaging effect of free radical neurotoxic compounds to the neurons by protecting the synaptic membrane (95178, 95179). Laboratory research suggests that piracetam reduces markers of membrane damage (95186).\n\nPiracetam also appears to facilitate neurotransmission of compounds including catecholamines, serotonin, acetylcholine, and glutamate (95177, 95178, 100999). Piracetam is thought to increase the density of receptors or restore their function. It is likely that any impact of piracetam on neuronal membrane fluidity improves activity of neurotransmitter receptors (95178, 95186). In aging models, piracetam has been shown to improve receptor density and function. In alcohol-treated animals, it appears to promote neuroplasticity (95186).\nVascular effects\nThere is interest in using piracetam for the treatment and prevention of various vascular diseases. The effect of piracetam on the fluidity of the cell membrane results in changes in activity of blood cells, platelets, and the blood vessel wall. Some scientists suggest that piracetam influences membrane fluidity by inducing the reorganization of membrane lipids (95186, 95187).\n\nPiracetam seems to improve blood circulation, possibly by increasing deformability of red blood cells and reducing hyperaggregation of platelets (95177, 95179, 95181, 95186). Improved formability of red blood cells results in decreased adhesion to the endothelium and facilitated vascular movement (95186). The improved movement of red blood cells possibly plays a role in any benefits for sickle cell disease.\n\nPiracetam has also been shown to improve the fluidity of platelets from elderly individuals and to reduce levels of agents involved in blood coagulation (95186). Again, this is possibly related to an effect of piracetam on membrane fluidity. However, some evidence also suggests that piracetam inhibits the production of thromboxane A2, involved in the induction of platelet aggregation (95187). The role of piracetam in prevention of overactive platelet aggregation could explain any benefit in stroke or other vascular disorders (95187).\n\nPiracetam could also benefit circulation by improving vasodilation. In laboratory research, piracetam normalized the vascular diameter after induced spasm, possibly by inducing synthesis of the vasodilator, prostacyclin (95186)."

    "Plant Sterols": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Plant sterols are substances similar to cholesterol found naturally in fruits, cereals, legumes, vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds. There are many plant sterols; however, the main ones are beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol. Foods, including spreads, enriched with plant sterols may contain single products, plant sterols alone, or combinations of plant sterols and stanols (5814, 112081, 112083). In the US, foods containing at least 650 mg of plant sterols are allowed to state that \"diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include two servings of foods that provide a daily total of at least 3.4 grams of plant stanol esters may reduce the risk of heart disease\" (102365).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Plant sterols have been safely used in studies lasting up to one year (35022, 35037, 90724, 90726, 90730, 90732, 90733, 90734, 90739, 90742).\nDue to the unknown safety of plant sterol oxidation products, and the known production of these oxidation products during the heating of foods (106092), there is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of heat-treated foods containing added plant sterols.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Plant sterols have been safely used in children in studies lasting for up to 6 months (35037, 90722, 90723, 90726, 90731, 35106).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, plant sterols are generally well tolerated.\nDermatologic\nAcute dermatitis has been reported in a case report of a 51-year-old female who used a pharmacy-brand plant sterol supplement to lower cholesterol levels. The rash was widespread with lesions on the hands and feet and a red and swollen face. The patient was treated orally with prednisolone and topically with emollients for 2 weeks (90737). It is not entirely clear if this adverse effect was due to the plant sterol supplement or another contributing factor.\nless\nEndocrine\nPeripheral precocious puberty has been described in a 20-month-old boy who ingested about 15 grams daily of a chicken essence product containing the plant sterol avenasterol, also known as clerosterol or chondrillasterol. Signs and symptoms included elevated estradiol and testosterone levels, acne, hairiness, increased penis size, hoarse voice, and increased growth rate. These effects were reversed when the product was stopped (112084).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nAbdominal discomfort has occurred in one child in a clinical trial of oral plant sterols (35106). Because plant sterols decrease cholesterol absorption in the gut, there is concern that they might produce some gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and excess amounts of fat in the stool (steatorrhea), although these adverse effects have not been reported in clinical research.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Oral plant sterols are beneficial for reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when used in combination with a cholesterol-lowering diet in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).\nA meta-analysis of results from clinical research in children and adults with FH shows that taking plant sterols while following a cholesterol-lowering diet reduces total cholesterol by an additional 12 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by an additional 23 mg/dL when compared with following a cholesterol-lowering diet alone (90743). Individual clinical trials in adults and children 5 years and up show that consuming margarine spreads or yogurt enriched with plant sterol 1.6-2.3 grams daily for 4-26 weeks, sometimes in combination with statin therapy, reduces total cholesterol by up to 11% and LDL cholesterol by up to 14% in patients with FH (90726, 90731, 35037, 35106). However, most clinical research shows that plant sterols do not reduce triglyceride levels or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in patients with FH (35037, 35106, 90743).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral plant sterols in doses of 2-3 grams daily are beneficial for reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not triglycerides, when used in combination with a cholesterol-lowering diet.\nClinical research shows that taking plant sterols, alone or in combination with plant stanols, reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Taking plant sterols daily while following a cholesterol-lowering diet reduces total cholesterol by about 3% to 8% and LDL cholesterol by about 5% to 15% when compared with dieting alone (5336, 5437, 7105, 65749, 90686, 90720, 90722, 90723, 90724, 90734)(90741, 90748, 90752, 106093). Plant sterols seem to have the most significant cholesterol-lowering effect in people who naturally produce a high amount of cholesterol (90742). When taken along with statin therapy, plant sterols can lower total cholesterol by about 12-22 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by about 11-16 mg/dL when compared with statin therapy alone (90728, 96272). Predictive modeling suggests that the cholesterol reduction from plant sterols can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease over time. In English adults with hypercholesterolemia and no cardiovascular disease, replacing regular spreads with plant sterol -enriched spreads over a 20-year period could potentially prevent 69 cardiovascular events per 10,000 males and 40 events per 10,000 females (98449).\n\nPlant sterols, usually as esters, with or without plant stanols, 0.2-9 grams daily for up to one year have been used (5336, 5437, 5814, 7105, 14298, 90686, 90720, 35034, 90722, 90723)(90724, 90726, 90730, 90732, 90733, 90734, 90741, 90742, 90744, 90748)(90752, 96272). However, the optimal dosage of plant sterols for reducing LDL cholesterol is about 2-3 grams daily taken with meals (5814, 90733, 90748). At this dosage, plant sterols seem to work as well as plant stanols but less effectively than taking policosanol 5-40 mg daily (14298, 90730). When taken as fortified foods, plant sterols appear to be more effective when taken in dairy products than in breads or cereals (35034). No increased benefit is seen at dosages higher than 2-3 grams daily (90744). In post-menopausal females, a meta-analysis of 6 studies shows that plant sterols are most effective for reducing total and LDL cholesterol in patients with obesity, using a daily dose of plant sterols greater than 2 grams, and duration of treatment greater than 8 weeks (112081). Additionally, some clinical research shows that plant sterols might become less effective after about 2-3 months of treatment (90726).\n\nResults from most individual clinical studies show that plant sterols do not reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia (65749, 90720, 90732, 96272, 106093, 112081). However, a meta-analysis of results from 12 clinical studies shows that taking plant sterols 0.8-4 grams daily reduces triglyceride levels by 6% in patients with hypercholesterolemia (90732). This suggests that plant sterols might modestly lower triglyceride levels in some patients, but more research in larger patient populations is needed to confirm this finding. There is also some evidence showing that plant sterols prepared as ester derivatives using fish oil rather than sunflower oil, olive oil, or rapeseed oil can moderately lower triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (90739). However, this benefit is likely due to the triglyceride-lowering activity of fish oil rather than plant sterols. Taking plant sterols does not improve levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (65749, 90728, 90732, 96272, 112081).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an authorized health claim for dietary plant sterols, when taken in doses of at least 3.4 grams daily as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, for reducing the risk of CHD.\nIn 2010, the US FDA authorized a health claim stating that consuming at least 3.4 grams of plant sterols daily, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease (102365). This health claim is based on evidence showing that plant sterols can lower cholesterol levels. However, there is currently no evidence directly linking dietary intake of plant sterols with a reduced risk for developing CHD.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary plant sterols are beneficial for cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest intake of plant sterols is associated with a 37% reduced risk of cancer when compared with the lowest intake (106084).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary plant sterols are beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that dietary intake of specific plant sterols, including campesterol, stigmasterol, or beta-sitosterol, is not associated with risk of developing colon cancer. Dietary intake of plant sterols also does not affect the risk of rectal cancer in females; however, in males, higher dietary intake of the plant sterols campesterol or stigmasterol is associated with an INCREASED risk of rectal cancer (34993).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if dietary plant sterols influence the outcome of esophageal cancer.\nIn Chinese people with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the mortality rate does not seem to differ between those with the lowest versus the highest intake of dietary plant sterols, measured five years before diagnosis (112082).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if dietary plant sterols are beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that consuming at least 82.5 mg of plant sterols daily as part of the diet is associated with moderately lower odds of developing gastric cancer when compared to those who consume less than 45.5 mg daily (34984).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Although there is interest in using oral plant sterols for prediabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of plant sterols for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral plant sterols are beneficial for metabolic syndrome; the available research is conflicting.\nOne clinical study shows that taking yogurt mini-drinks providing plant sterols 2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks reduces total cholesterol by about 16%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 20%, and triglyceride levels by about 19% when compared with control yogurt drinks without plant sterols (90749). However, results from a much smaller study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking plant sterols 2 grams daily for 8 weeks in breakfast cereal and margarine does not improve plasma lipids or other cardiovascular markers when compared with placebo foods (90745). Reasons for the discrepancy are not clear but might relate to the dose or formulation of plant sterol, or the lipid levels of the patients at baseline.\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if dietary plant sterols are beneficial for MI prevention.\nPopulation research has found that consuming approximately 340 mg of plant sterols daily is associated with a 29% lower risk of first myocardial infarction in males when compared with those who consume about 150 mg daily. However, dietary plant sterol intake is not associated with a reduced risk of first myocardial infarction in females (90740).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral plant sterols are beneficial for obesity.\nIn Chinese adults, higher dietary intakes of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and total plant sterols are inversely related to the risk of being overweight. The risk of central obesity is linked to stigmasterol intake in females, and to beta-sitosterol intake in males (112083).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in obese individuals shows that consuming rice bran snack bars fortified with a mixture of plant sterols and stanols 1.8 grams daily for 8 weeks while following a reduced calorie diet does not increase weight loss, reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or improve blood glucose control when compared to dieting and consuming unfortified rice bran snack bars. However, the plant sterol-enriched rice bran snacks appear to decrease total cholesterol by about 10% more than unfortified rice bran snacks (90738).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate plant sterols for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPlant sterols have most often been used in doses of 1.6-3 grams daily for up to 1 year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTaking plant sterols with foods containing vitamin E and fat-soluble carotenoids, including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin, might reduce absorption and blood levels of these compounds. However, when corrected for cholesterol levels, the reduced levels are still within normal range. Therefore, this interaction does not seem to be clinically significant (5814, 7105, 15390, 35022, 35034, 35076, 90727, 90741, 96274).\nChildren\nOral:\nPlant sterols have most often been used in doses of 1.6-2.3 grams daily for up to 26 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nPlant sterols are often made more fat soluble to improve their ability to be incorporated into foods. This process involves esterifying the plant sterol. Most plant sterols included in foods are esterified to fat such as rapeseed oil, canola oil, or olive oil. Less commonly, plant sterols are esterified to fish oil (90739).\n\nIn some studies, plant sterols are taken as supplements in tablet or pill form (90722, 90723). When incorporated into foods, plant sterols are often added to margarine spreads (5336, 7105, 90726, 90734, 90742), dairy products such as skim milk or yogurt (90720, 35034, 90733, 90741), or grain foods such as bread or cereal (35034). Some plant sterol-fortified spreads used in clinical research are commercially available (Flora Pro-Activ, Unilever Bestfoods UK or Becel Pro-Activ, Unilever) (35037, 90726, 96272). Also, some plant sterols are available as commercially branded products. One such product (Reducol, Forbes Medi-Tech) is standardized to contain 81% plant sterol (primarily sitosterol) and 19% plant stanol (predominantly sitostanol) (90723, 90724). Another such product (Vegapure 95, Cognis Corporation) contains 49% beta-sitosterol, 24% campesterol, 17% stigmasterol, 4% brassicasterol, 3% campestanol, 1% sitostanol, and 2% other sterols (90752).",

However, when corrected for lower total cholesterol levels, the reduced levels are still within normal range. Therefore, this reduction does not seem to be clinically significant (96274).\nless\nVITAMIN E\nPlant sterols may reduce the absorption of vitamin E, although this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nPlant sterols may reduce absorption and blood levels of vitamin E (15390, 96274).

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nSITOSTEROLEMIA\nPlant sterols should be avoided by patients with sitosterolemia, a rare inherited lipid storage disease, due to potential for exacerbation of disease (5326, 10305). People with this disorder have increased absorption of cholesterol and plant sterols from the diet, and decreased clearance of plant sterols. Total body stores of plant sterols are significantly increased. Elevated hepatic levels of plants sterols such as sitosterol competitively inhibit cholesterol catabolism, contributing to hypercholesterolemia (3663). Patients with sitosterolemia are prone to premature coronary artery disease and xanthomas (3661, 3662). Plant sterols appear to be safe for heterozygous carriers of sitosterolemia (10457).\nless\nSHORT BOWEL SYNDROME\nPlant sterols should be used cautiously by patients with short bowel syndrome. In a patient with short bowel syndrome given a soy-based intravenous fat emulsion providing plant sterols 87 mg daily, serum liver transaminase levels were at least 2.5 times above the upper limit of normal. Levels were reduced to 1.4-1.8 times the upper limit when the soy-based product was replaced with an olive oil-based emulsion providing plant sterol 37-65 mg daily (35080).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with plant sterols.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nPlant sterols have low bioavailability; only 2% to 6% is absorbed in the intestine, while the rest is excreted in the feces (112083). Although research in humans suggests that taking plant sterols increases levels of some individual sterols in the blood, the increases are generally small resulting in less than 1% total sterols, and the total level of sterols is not generally affected (65749, 35034, 90741). Also, any increase in blood levels of plant sterols seems to stabilize after 4 weeks of use and levels remain in the physiological range (96273). Plant sterols consumed from unheated food sources do not seem to increase blood levels of plant sterol oxidation products, which are found in low levels in these sources. However, consuming plant sterols from heated food sources increases levels of these oxidation products in the blood (106092).\nExcretion\nIn human research, half-lives of campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol, following an intravenous bolus injection of a chylomicron-like lipid emulsion containing triglycerides, cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, and squalene, are 37 minutes, 17 minutes, and 15 minutes, respectively, and return to baseline occurs 45 minutes after injection (34989).\n\nIn people with obesity, weight loss achieved with a combination of phentermine and orlistat is associated with reduced serum levels of plant sterols, including sitosterol. Orlistat is thought to increase oxysterol metabolism. Serum levels increase back to baseline when the weight is regained (112085).\n\nBeta-sitosterol is excreted in bile and feces (34989, 35149).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPlant sterols are 28- or 29-carbon alcohols related to cholesterol. The main plant sterols are beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol, with 60% to 90% of the sterols typically found in plant-based foods being beta-sitosterol (5814, 6668, 112083).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn human research, plant sterols reduce levels of endothelin-1, a peptide vasoconstrictor. This effect seems to be unrelated to the lipid lowering effects of plant sterols (106093).\nEndocrine effects\nAnimal research suggests that plant sterols can be converted to testosterone by microorganisms in the gut, and increase circulating testosterone. They also have estrogenic effects (112084).\nLipid-lowering effects\nPlant sterols are absorbed poorly resulting in a competitive inhibition of dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption by competing with cholesterol for the limited space in mixed micelles (5436, 5814, 7196, 112081). In laboratory research, some plant sterols also interfere with cholesterol biosynthesis. The plant sterols stigmasterol and brassicasterol are effective, but not beta-sitosterol or campesterol. The mechanism of action appears to be related to the inhibition of sterol (24)-reductase (35009).\n\nClinical research shows that taking plant sterols reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5% to 15% (5336, 5437, 7105, 34967, 90720, 90722, 90723, 90724, 90726, 90741)(90748, 90752). A dose-response relationship exists for plant sterols at doses up to about 3 grams daily. Higher doses do not seem to have greater cholesterol-lowering effects (90748). Plant sterols can begin to lower LDL cholesterol within as little as 3 weeks (90686, 90730, 90748). Plant sterols may not have the same effect in all people. Some research suggests that plant sterols might work better in people with apolipoprotein E4 alleles, a genetic predisposition to hypercholesterolemia (7195).\nWeight-reducing effects\nThe plant sterol beta-sitosterol downregulates c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and the IKK-beta / NF-kappa-B signaling pathway, reducing adipose tissue mass and inhibiting preadipocyte proliferation (112083)."

Consumption of dried plums or plum pits has been reported to cause bowel obstruction and esophageal perforation.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, plum has been reported to cause gastrointestinal issues (95272, 95276, 95285), including flatulence (95293) and diarrhea (95300).\n\nIn one case report, small bowel obstruction with impaction in the terminal ileum occurred in a 10-month old infant who consumed a dried plum. This was likely due to the infant being unable to properly chew the plum (95296).\n\nConsumption of plum pits has also caused serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Ileal obstruction occurred in a 71-year-old female who swallowed a plum pit (101250). In a young male, ileostomy obstruction due to plum pits has occurred (95298). Swallowing a plum pit has also caused an esophageal perforation in a 75-year-old male (95285).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, plum has been reported to cause allergic reaction in sensitive individuals (95286, 95297).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Consuming whole dried plums (prunes), plum juice, or plum puree seems to improve symptoms of constipation at least as effectively as psyllium.\nClinical research in patients with chronic constipation shows that taking dried plum juice 54 grams daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the rate of hard and lumpy stools and increases the rate of normal stools at about 3 weeks when compared with placebo. Subjective improvements in constipation and hard stools also occurred by 8 weeks. However, there was no effect on flatulence, loose stools, or feelings of urgent or incomplete defecation (109233). Another small clinical study in patients with certain gastrointestinal symptoms shows that consuming a drink containing dried plum puree and plum juice 125 mL twice daily for 2 weeks increases fecal frequency by 0.6 times per week when compared to baseline (95293). However, the validity of the finding in this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nResearch has also compared dried plums with psyllium. One small clinical study in adults shows that taking dried plums 50 grams twice daily for 3 weeks improves straining and consistency and modestly increases the number of weekly bowel movements when compared with taking an equivalent dose of fiber in the form of psyllium 11 grams daily (95280). Another small clinical study in adults with constipation shows that drinking a specific type of plum juice (PlumSmart, Sunsweet Growers) 240 mL daily 15-30 minutes prior to the main meal for 2 weeks results in a 4.7-fold greater likelihood of relief from constipation within 24 hours when compared with drinking apple juice. Drinking plum juice is equally effective to drinking apple juice containing psyllium. Plum juice also improves stool softness, although it does not increase the weekly number of bowel movements, when compared with apple juice (95294). Clinical research also shows that taking a specific plum-derived mixed fiber supplement (SupraFiber, Sunsweet Growers Inc.) 5 grams dissolved in liquid twice daily after meals for 4 weeks improves symptoms of constipation as effectively as psyllium 5 grams daily. An increase of at least one complete bowel movement per week for at least 2 weeks occurred in 75% of patients in both groups (95275).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral dried plums (prunes) are beneficial in the treatment of dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies shows that taking plum as either dried plum 11.5-100 grams daily or prune and plum juice 50-250 mL daily for 2 to 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but does not improve total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo (112401). The interpretation of these results is limited by poor quality of evidence and heterogeneity due to differences in study populations, design, and amounts and types of plum used. In addition, it is unclear whether patients in all studies had dyslipidemia at baseline.\nless\nHepatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral plum for hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of plum for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral plum is beneficial for hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small to moderate-sized clinical trials in adults shows that taking dried plum 11.5-23 grams daily for 8 weeks, prune juice 57 grams daily for 2 weeks, or plum juice 200-250 mL daily for 8-12 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (112402). The validity of these findings is limited by low quality of evidence and substantial heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled individuals of varying health status and studied different types and regimens of plum. In addition, some studies were in healthy or normotensive patients.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral plum is beneficial for overweight or obesity.\nMeta-analysis of 7 small to moderate-sized, moderate-quality clinical trials in adults with normal weight, or overweight and obesity shows that taking dried plum 75-84 grams daily for 8 to 12 weeks or prune or plum juice 50 to 250 mL daily for 4 to 24 weeks does not reduce body weight (112402). Additionally, meta-analysis of 5 of these clinical trialsstudies also shows plum does not reduce body fat percentage (112402).\nless\nOsteopenia. Some preliminary clinical research shows that oral dried plums (prunes) are beneficial for preventing loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal adults. It is unclear if prunes can increase BMD or if they are beneficial for preventing loss of BMD in other populations.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults aged 55-75 years shows that eating dried plums 50 grams daily for 12 months preserves hip BMD, compared with a modest reduction in hip BMD in adults eating no dried plums. However, there was no benefit on other body sites or on total body BMD. The greatest benefit occurred in individuals with the lowest BMD at baseline. Calcium carbonate and vitamin D3 were supplemented as needed to provide a total intake of calcium 1200 mg and vitamin D3 800 IU from diet plus supplements. This study also evaluated a dose of 100 grams daily; however, there was a high dropout rate in this study arm (109236). The validity of the findings from this study are limited by the mixed population, of which 68% had osteopenia and the remainder had osteoporosis or normal BMD. Other preliminary clinical research in osteopenic postmenopausal adults shows that eating dried plum 100 grams, in addition to taking calcium 500 mg and vitamin D 400 IU, daily for 12 months improves BMD in the ulna by a moderate amount and in the spine by a small amount when compared with consuming dried apple (95276, 95278). In the same population also receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation, consumption of dried plums 50 grams or 100 grams daily for 6 months modestly attenuates total body, but not total hip, lumbar spine, or forearm, losses in BMD when compared with control (95284). Some very preliminary clinical research suggests that this increase in BMD might be maintained for up to 5 years after dried plum consumption (95279).\n\nHowever, research in other populations has not shown benefit. A clinical study in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors shows that consuming dried plums 90 grams daily for 6 months does not improve BMD, muscular strength, or body composition when compared with participating in resistance training and taking calcium 450 mg and vitamin D 800 IU daily (95277). Also, in middle aged and older males, preliminary clinical research shows that eating dried plum 100 grams, in addition to taking calcium 500 mg and vitamin D 300 IU, daily for 12 months does not improve most measures of BMD when compared with not eating plum (109235). However, only some of the patients in this study had osteopenia or osteoporosis.\nless\nPostoperative ileus. It is unclear if oral dried plums (prunes) are beneficial for improving gastrointestinal function after surgery.\nA small clinical study in females taking docusate sodium 100 grams twice daily after gynecological surgery shows that adding up to 12 dried plums (4 ounces) daily for three days does not reduce the time to first bowel movement when compared with docusate sodium alone. There was also no effect on pain severity with a bowel movement, the need for laxatives, or time to discharge. However, consuming dried plums increased the likelihood of having a bowel movement during the first three days after surgery (109237). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and its small size.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate plum for these uses.",

Plum phenolics are absorbed in the small intestine (101247).\nMetabolism\nFollowing consumption of plum juice, anthocyanins are metabolized mainly to glucuronide conjugates (101249).\nExcretion\nFollowing consumption of dried plums, hippuric acid, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid are excreted in the urine (101247, 112403). Following consumption of plum juice, anthocyanins such as cyanidin conjugates are excreted in the urine (101249).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the plum is the fruit. When dried, plums contain fiber at levels as high as 6 grams per 100 grams of plums, which is equivalent to approximately 12 dried plums. The main type of dietary fiber in plums is pectin. Plum also contains fructans, hemicelluloses, and cellulose (95279, 95295, 101247). Plums are a source of carotenoids, mainly beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin, depending on variety, as well as flavonoids and phenolic compounds such as ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid, quercetin and quercetin-3-glucoside neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acids, feruleoylquinic acids, and caffeic acid (95270, 95271, 101247, 112403).\n\nPlums are also a good source of many vitamins and minerals (95270, 95271, 101247). One specific mineral found in relatively high levels in dried plum is boron. Approximately 5 dried plums provide 1.1 mg of boron daily; the average daily intake of boron is 1-2 mg (95279, 101247). Other minerals of interest in dried plum are potassium and copper (95279, 101247). Dried plums are also a source of sorbitol and inositol (101247).\n\nDried plums are made by drying the plum at temperatures between 60-900°C. Drying for a shorter time at higher temperatures maintains some of the phenolic compounds in the dried plum. However, the anthocyanins in plum are almost completely destroyed in the drying process (95270, 101247).\nAnticancer effects\nIn laboratory research, plum and prune extract, as well as phenolic constituents, have shown anti-cancer effects, resulting in apoptosis of colon, breast, liver, and other cancer cell lines (95270).\n\nPlum might also have activity that is specific to the prevention of colon cancer. The fiber and sorbitol in dried plums result in a decreased colonic transit time. Furthermore, in human and animal research, dried plum fiber binds to, and results in a reduced formation of, fecal bile acids. The antioxidant effects of dried plum phenolics can act locally to decrease the production of potential cancer-causing compounds produced by bacteria in the colon. Animal research shows that consumption of freeze-dried plums reduces the formation of pre-cancerous foci. Together, these activities suggest a reduced risk of colon cancer with plum consumption (101247).\n\nAlthough there is no evidence of benefit of plums for breast cancer, human research suggests that eating 200 grams daily of dried plums over three menstrual cycles improves levels of circulating biologically active estrogen, possibly reducing the level of estrogen exposure and reducing the risk for breast cancer (95299).\nAntimicrobial effects\nBoth dried and fresh plum have antimicrobial effects in laboratory models (101247). There is interest in using plums for phenolic compounds that might reduce levels of bacteria involved in urinary tract infections. However, there is no evidence to support plums for this use (101247).\nAntioxidant effects\nA small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal adults shows that consuming dried plums 50-100 grams daily for 6 months improves total antioxidant capacity and levels of superoxide dismutase activity when compared with baseline (106708).\nAppetite effects\nIn human research, eating dried plums has been shown to increase satiety, possibly by reducing levels of ghrelin (95302). Some research also suggests that dried plums reduce hunger and energy intake at the next meal (95303), although this is not consistent (95302).\nBone effects\nSome evidence suggests that eating dried plum improves bone mineral density (BMD) after menopause (95276, 95278, 95279, 95284, 101247, 109236). In animals, dried plum restores BMD, prevents bone loss, increases bone formation, and suppresses bone turnover (95270, 95278, 95279, 101247). Some human and animal studies also show that plum improves markers of bone turnover; however, this finding is not consistent between studies, possibly due to differences in evaluated endpoints. Some studies evaluated gene expression whereas others evaluated serum levels. Also, there is no clear evidence from these markers as to whether dried plum impacts bone formation, bone resorption, or both (95270, 95271, 95276, 95277, 95278, 95279, 95284, 95300, 101247, 109234, 109236).\n\nDried plum is high in phenolics like chlorogenic acid and its derivatives. These have been shown to inhibit the formation of osteoclasts in vitro, potentially playing a role in the inhibition of bone loss (95270, 95271, 95279, 100982). These constituents have antioxidant effects in some human and laboratory models. They also inhibit inflammatory pathways in cells (95270, 95279, 100982). Plum, especially dried plum, is also a good source of the mineral boron, which is necessary for bone health. In laboratory research, boron stimulates bone growth and metabolism, and preserves bone strength (95279, 101247). Dried plum is also a good source of potassium, which is associated with maintenance of BMD in epidemiological research, and copper, which is needed for the crosslinking of structural proteins like collagen (95279, 101247).\n\nAny benefit of plum on bone health does not appear to be related to estrogenic effects (95300).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using plum to improve cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and blood lipids; however, the benefits and mechanism of action are unclear. In healthy adults, drinking plum juice high in anthocyanins reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (101249). In adults with prehypertension, consuming 3-6 dried plums (approximately 11.5-23 grams) and their soaking water following an overnight soaking daily for 8 weeks reduced systolic blood pressure by 3% to 4%. However, drinking clean water also led to a reduction in blood pressure, and the lower dose of plums had a greater effect on blood pressure than the higher dose (95273). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults with varying health status does not show a reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 4-24 weeks of consuming dried plum, prune juice, or plum juice (112402). In a hypertensive animal model of atherosclerosis, dried plum powder had no effect on cholesterol levels but did reduce atherosclerotic lesions. However, dietary intake in these animal models was much higher than a feasible amount in humans (101247). A small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal adults shows that consuming dried plums 100 grams or 50 grams daily for 6 months improves levels of total cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, respectively, when compared with baseline (106708). However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that dried plum, plum juice, or prune juice reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but doesn't reduce total cholesterol or raise HDL cholesterol (112401).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPlums are historically used for the management of constipation. The laxative effect of plums and dried plums is thought to be mainly related to their dietary fiber. However, dried plums are also a source of chlorogenic acid and sorbitol. Sorbitol and the soluble dietary fiber in plum both hold on to water in the colon (95271, 95280, 109233).\n\nThere is some evidence that plum might exhibit prebiotic effects in humans. Consuming a drink of plum concentrate increased the number of healthy bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, and decreased the quantity of undesirable bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli, in hypercholesterolemic adults (95274). The dietary fiber in plum has been shown to have prebiotic effects in humans (95274). These fibers are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in the colon to short chain fatty acids (95279, 101247). Additionally, a large clinical trial in post-menopausal adults shows consuming dried plums (prunes) at least 50 grams daily for 12 months enriches the gut microbiome with a greater abundance of bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae taxa including Blautia and Anaerostipes genus compared with a control diet containing no dried plums (112403). Lachnospiraceae are also known to ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (112403).\nImmune effects\nIn animal research, freeze-dried plum powder induced spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to a parasite. In vitro, plum extract inhibited the immune response in models of immune overstimulation. However, there is no evidence to suggest that plum or dried plum has an immunomodulatory effect in humans (101247).\nJoint effects\nIn an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), eating dried plum delayed the onset of arthritis, limited bone erosion in joints, and reduced synovial membrane inflammation. The mice used in this study were bred to overexpress tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a known contributor to RA-related symptoms. In vitro, neochlorogenic acid, a major plum polyphenol, down-regulated several genes associated with TNF-mediated inflammatory and immune response pathways. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the effects of plum on the symptoms and progression of arthritis may be due to the inhibition of TNF signaling (100982).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn an animal aging model, drinking plum juice, but not eating dried prune powder, improved memory and learning. This was likely due to the antioxidant effects of the plum juice (101247)."

Podophyllotoxin was also evaluated for use in cancer, but found to be too toxic. Safer, synthetic derivatives, including etoposide and teniposide, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as cancer treatments.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). Small clinical studies suggest that podophyllum resin (podophyllin) and its constituent podophyllotoxin are effective for clearing anogenital warts.\nTopically, application of podophyllin, as a 10% to 25% suspension in tincture of benzoin, or as a 0.5% to 4% gel, 1-3 times weekly for up to 8 weeks, is effective for removal of anogenital warts caused by HPV. Podophyllin is applied to an area of no more than 10 cm2, with protection of the surrounding skin to minimize toxicity. It should be washed off 4-6 hours after application. (68917). However, the constituent podophyllotoxin is usually used because it is less toxic. Podophyllotoxin (Podofilox; Condylox) is an FDA-approved drug (12902, 12903). Although some research has suggested that podophyllotoxin is more effective than podophyllin (12904), other clinical research suggests that self-treatment with topical podophyllin 0.5% to 2% is equally effective to podophyllotoxin 0.5% for removal of penile warts (68945). Also, applying podophyllin 20% appears to be as effective as podophyllotoxin 8% solution and colchicine 8% solution for removal of penile warts (68943).\n\nBoth of these chemicals have been compared with other topical treatments. Preliminary clinical research in adults with vulvar warts shows that topical podophyllin solution 20%, applied for 8 weeks, seems to be no different for clearing warts and preventing wart recurrence than using imiquimod or cryotherapy (90190).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSignificant absorption of compounds in podophyllum occurs through the skin and gastrointestinal tract (5617).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of podophyllum are the root, rhizome, and resin. Podophyllum resin (podophyllin) is obtained from the rhizome. The major active constituents in podophyllin are podophyllotoxin, quercetin, and kaempferol (12896, 12902). Podophyllin also contains the toxins podophylloresin and alpha- and beta-peltatin (12900).\nCytotoxic effects\nPodophyllum demonstrates cytotoxicity through a number of pathways, including interruption of cellular mitosis at metaphase (5617, 12897, 12899). It increases the incorporation of amino acids into proteins and inhibits purine synthesis and incorporation of purines into RNA. It also inhibits mitochondrial function (5617). In animal research, podophyllum causes neuronal swelling, depletion of the Nissl substance (RNA/polyribosomes) of the dorsal root ganglion, and nerve fiber thickening in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. These effects may explain the neurological effects associated with podophyllum toxicity in humans (68888). In other research in animals ingesting podophyllum, degenerative changes are observed in the liver, intestine, testes, and pancreas due to inhibition of protein synthesis and mitosis (68889).\nRadioprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that an aqueous extract of podophyllum, quercetin, and podophyllotoxin might have antioxidant effects and protect against radiation damage. These podophyllum constituents also seem to increase apoptosis and phagocytosis of cells damaged by radiation, making way for new cells (12896, 12901)."

The pentadecylcatechols present in urushiol act as haptens to varying extents, binding to skin proteins to create antigens which the immune system recognizes as foreign. Urushiol-specific T-lymphocytes of the CD8+ phenotype are generated, and the antigens stimulate keratinocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and interleukins 2, 8 and 10 which modulate the immune reaction (68993, 68994, 69005, 69018, 69041). Sensitization occurs with the initial exposure to urushiol, regardless of route, and leads to more severe and rapid reactions with subsequent exposures (18). The degree of sensitivity is variable and depends on factors such as age and race (3839, 68955, 68983, 68990, 69028, 69032)."

The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in doses, treatment durations, patient populations, and specific policosanol products studied.\n\nClinical research in subjects with hypercholesterolemia, largely conducted by researchers in Cuba, shows that taking policosanol orally 5-20 mg daily for 8-24 weeks lowers total cholesterol by 9% to 29% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 11% to 42% and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 7% to 34% when compared with placebo or other controls (2927, 2928, 2929, 2930, 2943, 2944, 14298, 14411, 65348, 65354)(65355, 65356, 65361, 65363, 65365, 65369, 65375, 65380, 65383, 69104)(69105, 69106, 65362, 65351, 100178).\n\nWhen compared to conventional drugs, some research also shows that policosanol 10 mg daily lowers total and LDL cholesterol by a similar amount as fluvastatin 20 mg daily and simvastatin 10 mg daily (8147, 12190). Atorvastatin 10 mg daily appears to be more effective than policosanol 10 mg daily for lowering total and LDL cholesterol (14411).\n\nHowever, the majority of research conducted outside of Cuba has been contradictory. Research in subjects with hypercholesterolemia, conducted by German, Canadian, Croatia, South African, Netherlands, U.S., and Italian researchers, shows that taking policosanol 10-80 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not significantly decrease total or LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (14336, 15062, 69111, 69119, 69107, 69109, 69110, 12166, 14404). These studies included policosanol derived from Cuban sugar cane, U.S. sugar cane, wheat germ, and red yeast rice and specific policosanol products (Lesstanol Octa-60, Garuda International; Cholesstor, Pharmed Group) (69107, 69109, 69110, 12166, 14404).\n\nPolicosanol has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Taking a product containing policosanol 10 mg, berberine 500 mg, and red yeast rice 200 mg daily for up to 12 months seems to reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients when compared with placebo or ezetimibe 10 mg (34262, 34283, 34301). Taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing policosanol, berberine, red yeast rice, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin daily for 8 weeks appears to reduce total cholesterol by 13% and LDL cholesterol by 21%, as well as increasing HDL cholesterol by 5% when compared with baseline in patients with metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia (89438). A meta-analysis also shows that taking this combination product for up to 1 year reduces total cholesterol by 10%, LDL cholesterol by 14%, and triglycerides by 7%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 4%, when compared with baseline in patients with hypercholesterolemia (92142). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to policosanol, red yeast rice (which contains monacolin K, a chemical similar to lovastatin), other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral policosanol is beneficial for patients with hypertension.\nClinical research in adults with prehypertension shows that taking policosanol 20 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 7%, compared to non-significant changes with placebo. A lower dose of policosanol 10 mg daily did not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo (100177).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral policosanol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing policosanol, berberine, red yeast rice, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin daily for 18 weeks improves systolic blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and flow-mediated dilation in patients with metabolic syndrome when compared with control (34289). It is unclear if these effects are due to policosanol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate policosanol for these uses.",

It refers to a mixture of 24-34 carbon alcohols comprised primarily of octacosanol (28-C) and also including tetracosanol (24-C), hexacosanol (26-C), heptacosanol (27-C), nonacosanol (29-C), triacosanol (30-C), dotriacontanol (32-C), and tetratriacontanol (268, 269, 270).\nAntidiabetes effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking policosanol 20 mg orally for 12 weeks modestly improves glycated hemoglobin levels when compared with placebo (112724).\nAntiplatelet effects\nPolicosanol decreases arachidonic acid-, adenosine diphosphate-, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (2933, 2935, 2936, 2937, 2938, 103832). Policosanol 20 mg per day reduces platelet aggregation about as much as aspirin 100 mg per day (2937), but it does not seem to significantly affect coagulation time (2935, 2937).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using policosanol for hypertension. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking policosanol 20 mg orally for 12 weeks modestly improves systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (112724).\n\nOther clinical research in elderly patients with dyslipidemia shows that policosanol reduces levels of circulating endothelial cells, which are a measure of the vascular endothelial cell injury that initiates atherosclerotic lesions. It also lowers homocysteine levels, reducing vascular inflammation and coronary vascular lesions, and lowers C-reactive protein levels, indicating a reduction in chronic cardiovascular inflammation (103832).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nPolicosanol seems to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis (2934, 2939), and increasing the degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2939). In animal models, policosanol also seems to increase the antioxidant, anti-glycation, and anti-atherosclerotic effects of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (100177). Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking policosanol 20 mg orally for 12 weeks modestly improves HDL and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (112724).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking policosanol 20 mg orally for 12 weeks very modestly improves markers of liver function, such as alanine transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase when compared with placebo (112725)."

            "Overview": "Polydextrose is a synthetic, non-digestible, complex carbohydrate made of glucose (27192, 27193, 90821, 98662, 98663). It is commonly used in foods to replace sugar, starch, or fat; to increase the creaminess of the food product; as a prebiotic; or as a bulking agent (27233, 90821, 98663). Polydextrose is classified as a soluble fiber and prebiotic (90821, 90822, 98663).\n\nCAUTION: Polydextrose should not be confused with other prebiotics, such as Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and Inulin.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally as a food additive. Polydextrose is considered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be safe when used as a food additive, provided a single serving contains less than 15 grams (26210).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in divided doses up to 50 grams daily for 12 weeks (27193, 34118, 98658, 98659, 106478). However, polydextrose can have laxative effects when taken orally in doses greater than 90 grams daily or greater than 50 grams as a single dose (27193, 106478).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in higher doses. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has determined that there is no need for an acceptable daily intake of polydextrose when used as a food additive (106478). However, polydextrose can have laxative effects when taken orally in doses greater than 90 grams daily or greater than 50 grams as a single dose (27193, 106478).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Polydextrose appears to be safe for infants when administered at doses of 2-4 grams per liter of formula and for children aged 4-8 years when administered at doses of about 4 grams daily. While some studies show no adverse effects of polydextrose, others suggest a potential for increased abdominal pain, diarrhea, and eczema (26709, 27200, 99211, 106482, 106527).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, polydextrose seems to be well tolerated when used in doses of less than 50 grams.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, diarrhea, gas.\nDermatologic\nOrally, giving a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of polydextrose and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) (1:1 ratio) to infants has been associated with an increased incidence of atopic dermatitis in one clinical study (26709). However, it is unclear if this was due to polydextrose, GOS, or the combination.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, polydextrose may cause gas, bloating, and loose stools (27194, 27208, 27212). These adverse effects are more common when single doses of more than 50 grams or daily doses of more than 90 grams are used. Higher doses of polydextrose (90 grams/day or more) may also cause transient diarrhea in some people (27193). Giving a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of polydextrose and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) (1:1 ratio) to infants has been associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects, primarily constipation and diarrhea, in one clinical study (106527). However, it is unclear if this was due to polydextrose, GOS, or the combination.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, one participant in one clinical study complained of transient dizziness after eating yogurt containing polydextrose 12.5 grams (98660).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, giving infants a formula supplemented with 8 grams/L of a 50:33:17 mixture of polydextrose, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose has been associated with increased infant irritability when compared with control formula (26709). However, it is not known if this was related to the polydextrose, other ingredients, or the combination. An increase in irritability did not occur in infants given a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of polydextrose and GOS (1:1 ratio) (26709, 106527).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nColic. Oral polydextrose has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical trial in healthy infants 14-35 days of age shows that feeding a cow's milk-based formula containing 4 grams/L of a prebiotic blend of polydextrose and galacto-oligosaccharides (1:1 ratio) until around 4 months of age leads to faster normalization of daytime sleep patterns when compared with cow's milk-based formula alone. Episodes of crying were also shorter after 2 months, but not 4 months, of supplementation (106527). It is unclear if the findings from this study in healthy infants can be generalized to those with colic.\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral polydextrose is beneficial in adults or children with constipation.\nOne small, low-quality, study in Japanese patients with dialysis-related constipation despite the use of laxatives shows that taking polydextrose 10 grams daily for 4 weeks increases weekly stool frequency from 3 stools to 8.5 stools, compared with an increase from 3.5 stools to 5 stools in the placebo group. However, taking polydextrose did not improve stool consistency, abdominal distention, or diarrhea when compared with placebo (98658). Other clinical research in adults with functional constipation shows that taking 4-12 grams of polydextrose orally daily for 2 weeks improves weekly stool frequency when compared with placebo. Preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that taking 12 grams of polydextrose may be more effective than lower doses. However, taking polydextrose did not improve colonic transit times or symptom scores when compared with placebo (106481). In contrast, clinical research in adults with chronic constipation shows that taking polydextrose (LitesseUltra, Danisco) 8 or 12 grams orally daily for 4 weeks does not improve stool consistency or frequency when compared with placebo (98659). Reasons for the conflicting results may relate to heterogeneity among the trial participants, including baseline constipation severity, and the studied dose and duration of polydextrose.\n\nIn children aged 4-8 years with functional constipation, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a mixture of polydextrose 4.17 grams and fructo-oligosaccharides 0.45 grams orally daily for 45 days improves the weekly frequency of bowel movements, clinical manifestations of constipation, and quality of stool type when compared with baseline (106482). It is unclear if these effects are due to polydextrose, fructo-oligosaccharides, or the combination. Also, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes.

It is unclear if oral polydextrose is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking 200 mL of a beverage containing polydextrose (Litesse, Danisco Sweeteners) 40 grams/L twice daily for 12 weeks does not affect fasting plasma glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or diet-treated type 2 diabetes (34118).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral polydextrose has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with constipation-predominant IBS shows that consuming polydextrose 5.85 grams in a 350-mL sterilized probiotic beverage containing Lactobacillus helveticus once daily for 1 week does not improve constipation-related symptoms or intestinal transit time when compared with consuming the sterilized probiotic beverage alone (106480). Additionally, it is unclear how these findings would compare with the use of standard care.\nless\nObesity. Polydextrose has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small open-label clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking polydextrose 1.7 grams with 5 billion CFUs each of the probiotics L. acidophilus NCFM and B. animalis subsp. lactis HN019 daily for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight or body fatcompared to baseline. However, when taken in combination with dietary advice, body weight , body fat, and visceral fat were modestly reduced compared with dietary advice alone (113273). It is unclear if these effects are due to polydextrose, probiotics, or the combination.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Polydextrose has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in premature infants shows that feeding a 1:1 combination of polydextrose and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS ) at a dose of 600-1200 mg daily during the first 60 days of life reduces the incidence of URTIs, including the common cold, when compared with placebo. However, this prebiotic combination does not seem to reduce the duration or severity of respiratory tract infections that do occur (99211).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn mammals, polydextrose is not easily digested by gastrointestinal enzymes (27194, 27203). Therefore, absorption is limited (106478).\nMetabolism\nIn mammals, polydextrose is partially fermented by bacteria in the large intestine, resulting in the production of volatile short chain fatty acids (27194, 27203, 106478).\nExcretion\nSome ingested polysaccharides are excreted intact in the stools. Anywhere from 10% to 50% of polysaccharides might resist fermentation. The ability to ferment polydextrose more completely might vary with each individual (27203, 27232, 98659). A small fraction of ingested polydextrose is excreted in urine (about 1%-4%) and in flatus and a larger fraction is excreted in the breath (15%-36%), while volatile short chain fatty acids derived from polydextrose are excreted in the feces (33%-50%) (27232, 106478).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPolydextrose is a non-digestible complex carbohydrate synthesized from glucose, sorbitol, and citric acid (90821).\nCognitive effects\nA small clinical study in healthy females aged 18-40 years shows that consumption of polydextrose is associated with modest improvements in cognitive performance, specifically cognitive flexibility and sustained attention (106483).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPolydextrose is a synthetic soluble fiber. In most animal and human research, polydextrose increases fecal mass, softens stools, and decreases fecal pH. These effects are attributed to its ability to bind to water and induce stool bulking (27198, 27212, 27216, 27232, 98659). Polydextrose might also support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, and increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, these findings are inconsistent (27198, 27200, 27216, 27232). Polydextrose does not appear to consistently reduce whole-gut transit time, although increased stool frequency has been shown in some research (27212, 27232, 98659).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAs a soluble fiber, polydextrose has the potential to reduce blood glucose levels (34118). Animal research in normal and obese mice fed a high-fat diet shows that consuming polydextrose 10 grams/kg orally daily for 12 weeks decreases blood glucose and improves glucose tolerance when compared with control (107933). In pregnant mice with obesity, supplementation with polydextrose improves maternal glucose tolerance without changes in gestational weight gain or caloric intake and improves offspring glucose homeostasis (106479).\n\nIn humans, taking polydextrose along with glucose may reduce glucose absorption by delaying gastric emptying (27198). However, preliminary clinical research in humans suggests that polydextrose does not significantly affect fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (27198, 34118).\nLipid effects\nBoth human and animal research show that polydextrose may reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol and triglycerides (27210, 41992, 98661). However, the effects of polydextrose on blood lipid levels are inconsistent. In mice fed high-fat diets, consuming polydextrose 10 grams/kg orally daily for 12 weeks decreases low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with control. In obese mice, research also shows that consuming polydextrose 10 grams/kg orally daily for 12 weeks decreases LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, but not triglyceride levels, when compared with control (107933).\n\nHowever, conflicting research exists. In humans, some clinical research shows that polydextrose increases HDL cholesterol and decreases the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (34118), while other clinical evidence suggests that polydextrose does not affect blood cholesterol levels (41992).\nReproductive effects\nIn pregnant mice with obesity, maternal supplementation with polydextrose attenuates decreases in fertility associated with maternal obesity (106479).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using polydextrose to prevent or treat obesity. As a sugar or fat replacement in foods, polydextrose has the potential to increase weight loss as it provides 25% of the energy of sucrose.\n\nAnimal research in mice fed a high-fat diet shows that consuming polydextrose 10 grams/kg orally daily for 12 weeks attenuates body weight gain when compared with control. Other animal research in obese mice shows that consuming polydextrose 10 grams/kg orally daily for 12 weeks also decreases body weight when compared with control (107933). In pregnant mice with obesity, supplementation with polydextrose attenuates weight gain in offspring via sex-specific changes in caloric intake and energy expenditure. Maternal polydextrose supplementation also prevents early mitochondrial damage and changes in the gut microbiota that can be predictive of obesity among offspring (106479).\n\nHowever, in humans, polydextrose has not demonstrated clear effects on body weight. In the majority of research, the consumption of polydextrose appears to mildly increase satiety and moderately suppress energy intake at a subsequent meal, although it does not seem to suppress the total daily energy intake (27222, 34767, 98660, 98662, 98663). Also, taking polydextrose for 15 days does not suppress energy intake on the last day (98664). Any effects on appetite might be related to slightly increased production of glucagon-like peptide 1 and insulin (98660, 98662)."

Specific Polypodium leucotomos extracts (Fernblock, Cantabria Farmaceutica; Anapsos, ASAC Pharma; others) have been used safely for up to 6 months (14365, 14367, 14479, 99276, 99282, 99283, 101470, 105522). The most common doses used have been 360-480 mg daily. Higher doses of 960-1200 mg daily have been used for shorter durations of 2-4 weeks, although a specific extract (Fernblock, Cantabria Laboratories) has been used at a dose of 960 mg daily for 6 months (14365, 99276, 99282, 105522). ...when used topically and appropriately, short-term.

It is unclear if oral or topical Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with actinic keratoses.\nPreliminary clinical research in bald men with at least two visible actinic keratoses on the scalp shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock, Industrial Farmaceutica Cantabria) 960 mg daily for one month and then 480 mg daily for 5 months, starting one week after photodynamic therapy, increases the clearance rate of actinic keratoses by a small amount compared with photodynamic therapy alone (99282). Additional preliminary clinical research in patients with severe photoaging and a history of actinic keratoses shows that topical application, alone or in combination with oral administration, of Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock) for 6 months has a large beneficial effect on the percentage of patients with new lesions or requiring new interventions when compared with a control consisting of recommendation for use of sun protection with SPF100. Once patients with new lesions at 6 months were removed from the study to receive further treatment, the percentage of patients with new lesions or requiring new interventions at 12 months was low and not statistically different between groups. The topical product consisted of a gel which was applied twice daily in sun-exposed skin areas. The oral product provided 240 mg once daily (110900). However, a small clinical trial shows that taking Polypodium leucotomos orally 500 mg twice daily for 60 days does not affect total or partial forearm actinic keratosis clearance or the appearance of genetically altered cells when compared with placebo. All patients in this trial were also applying sunscreen SPF30 alone topically to the forearm (110903). This study may have been underpowered to detect any effects of Polypodium leucotomos as it was part of a larger study examining topical treatments.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a Polypodium leucotomos extract (Anapsos, ASAC Pharma) orally might reduce inflammation in young patients with atopic dermatitis (69129). However, other clinical research shows that taking the same product 240-480 mg daily based on age does not improve the clinical course of atopic dermatitis or reduce the need for topical or systemic corticosteroids when compared with placebo in children with this condition (99277).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Polypodium leucotomos for cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Polypodium leucotomos for this purpose.\nCutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Although there has been interest in using oral Polypodium leucotomos for CLE, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Polypodium leucotomos for this condition.\nDementia. It is unclear if oral Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with dementia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate senile dementia shows that taking Polypodium leucotomos extract (Anapsos, ASAC Pharma) 360 mg daily for 4 weeks improves cognition scores. However, taking a higher dose of 720 mg daily does not appear to be effective; the reason for this discrepancy is unclear (69123).\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if oral Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with melasma.\nEvidence for the use of Polypodium leucotomos in melasma is conflicting. Preliminary clinical research in a small group of Hispanic women with moderate to severe facial melasma shows that taking Polypodium leucotomos extract orally 240 mg three times daily for 12 weeks, along with applying sunscreen, does not improve skin pigmentation when compared with placebo and sunscreen application (99278). However, other preliminary clinical research in a small group of Asian women shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos aqueous extract (Fernblock, Industrial Farmaceutica Cantabria) 240 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks along with topical hydroquinone cream and sunscreen reduces melasma scores by 55%, compared with 44% for placebo plus hydroquinone cream and sunscreen (101470).\nless\nPolymorphous light eruption (PMLE). It is unclear if oral Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with PMLE.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with PMLE shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock, Industrial Farmaceutica Cantabria) for 2 weeks helps to prevent ultraviolet light-induced eruptions. Doses were dependent on weight: 720 mg daily in patients up to 55 kg, 960 mg daily in patients 56-70 kg, or 1200 mg daily in patients over 70 kg. After treatment, approximately 30% of patients were protected against eruptions that occurred at the same ultraviolet dose in a prior treatment (99276). Other preliminary clinical research also shows that taking Polypodium leucotomos extract (Difa Cooper) 480 mg daily starting 15 days prior to sun exposure and continuing through sun exposure improves skin reactions and symptoms in approximately 74% of patients with idiopathic photodermatoses, primarily PMLE (99283).\nless\nPsoralen-UVA (PUVA) photodamage. It is unclear if oral or topical Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial for PUVA photodamage prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock, Cantabria Farmaceutica) 7.5 mg/kg on the evening prior to and the day of PUVA treatment can modestly reduce erythema, edema, and signs of epidermal damage. Polypodium leucotomos also seems to decrease subsequent hyperpigmentation in some patients (14366). Other preliminary research also shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Difur, Cantabria Farmaceutica) 1080 mg daily in four divided doses before sun exposure decreases photodamage in people with psoralen-sensitized skin. Topical application of a lotion containing Polypodium leucotomos extract 10%, 25%, or 50% also seems to reduce photodamage in this population (14476).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial in patients with psoriasis.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that taking Polypodium leucotomos extracts might improve symptoms of severe psoriasis (14479).\nless\nSunburn. It is unclear if oral or topical Polypodium leucotomos is beneficial for sunburn prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking two doses of a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock, Cantabria Farmaceutica) 7.5 mg/kg on the evening before and the morning of simulated sun exposure can modestly reduce acute erythema and signs of epidermal damage (14365). Other preliminary clinical research also shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Difur, Cantabria Farmaceutica) 1080 mg daily in four divided doses before sun exposure decreases photodamage. Topical application of a lotion containing Polypodium leucotomos extract 10%, 25%, or 50% might also reduce photodamage (14476).\nless\nVitiligo. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking Polypodium leucotomos in conjunction with twice weekly narrow-band ultraviolet B light therapy (NB-UVB) may improve pigmentation of the head and neck in adults with vitiligo, although its effect on other body areas is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with vitiligo that are also undergoing twice weekly NB-UVB shows that taking a specific Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock, Cantabria Laboratories) 480 mg twice daily for 6 months increases moderate repigmentation on the extremities and head and neck area when compared with placebo, with most improvements maintained for at least 3 months. However, repigmentation on other body areas is not improved (105522). Other preliminary clinical research also shows that taking this same Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock) 250 mg three times daily for 25-26 weeks in conjunction with twice weekly NB-UVB light therapy might improve repigmentation in the head and neck area of patients with vitiligo, although repigmentation on other body areas is not improved (69127). Anecdotal evidence also suggests that taking a specific rhizome extract of Polypodium leucotomos (Anapsos, ASAC Pharma) 360 mg daily for 5 months can promote repigmentation in patients with vitiligo (14367).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Polypodium leucotomos for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Polypodium leucotomos are the rhizome and the aerial plant parts. Some constituents of Polypodium leucotomos include calagualine, ecdysone, ecdysterone, and polypodaureia. Other constituents include several isomers of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid, and others (14480).\nAntioxidant effects\nPolypodium leucotomos seems to have antioxidant effects. These effects are possibly related to constituent phenolic compounds (14480).\nImmunomodulating effects\nA water extract of the aerial parts of Polypodium leucotomos extract might have immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro evidence suggests that the extract inhibits production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF). It might also decrease lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. Some evidence suggests that it significantly decreases production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma. However, it seems to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) (14368). Other preliminary evidence suggests that a specific water-based Polypodium leucotomos rhizome extract (Anapsos, ASAC Pharma) also inhibits IL-2 secretion, but it also seems to increase secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha (14477). Additional research suggests that Polypodium leucotomos extract might increase IL-2, IL-10, and other cytokines (14369). These different findings may be related to different study methodologies, different extracts, and different plant parts used. In animal models, Polypodium leucotomos extract seems to delay skin graft rejection (14368).\nUV protective effects\nPolypodium leucotomos is thought to protect against UV radiation damage by reducing the oxidative damage caused by UV radiation (14365, 14366, 14478, 14480). In animal models of UV irradiation, pre-treatment topical application of Polypodium leucotomos extract significantly reduces mast cell and blood vessel infiltrates compared to placebo (14368). In human research, Polypodium leucotomos was found to prevent mitochondrial DNA damage following UVA exposure (99280)."

Pomegranate root, stem, and peel should not be used orally in large amounts. Topically, pomegranate fruit extract seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOral: Diarrhea, flatulence.\nCardiovascular\nIn one clinical trial, 2% of patients experienced hyperlipidemia and hypertension after consumption of pomegranate juice (69175). However, most clinical research shows that pomegranate does not increase cholesterol or blood pressure and may actually improve these parameters in some patients (8310, 13022, 13023, 69168, 69373, 69374).\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, pomegranate may cause urticaria (hives) in some patients (8445).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, pomegranate may cause mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. In one clinical study, drinking pomegranate juice 8 ounces daily caused diarrhea and flatulence in 2% of patients (69175). In another clinical study, taking pomegranate extract (POMx, POM Wonderful LLC) 3000 mg daily caused diarrhea in 10% of patients. This dose of pomegranate extract also caused nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, gastrointestinal upset, and vomiting in a small number of patients (91695).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, pomegranate fruit or seeds may cause allergic reactions. These allergic reactions occur more commonly in people who are allergic to other plants (7674). In rare cases, pomegranate fruit can cause angioedema. Angioedema seems to occur without warning and in people who have eaten pomegranate for many years. Patients should be told to stop eating pomegranate if swelling of the tongue or face develops (7673). In one report, a patient experienced pomegranate-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The patient developed widespread urticaria (hives) and lip edema after eating pomegranate seeds and then exercising (17331). In another report, an atopic patient experienced an allergic reaction to pomegranate fruit. Symptoms included urticaria (hives), facial angioedema, and hypotension (91692).\n\nTopically, pomegranate may cause contact hypersensitivity characterized by urticaria (hives), angioedema, rhinorrhea, red itchy eyes, and dyspnea arising within a few minutes of exposure (8445).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, pomegranate juice may cause nasal congestion, but this event is rare. In one clinical study, pomegranate juice was associated with nasal congestion in 2% of patients (69175).

Oral pomegranate juice seems to modestly reduce blood pressure.\nMost clinical research evaluating pomegranate juice for reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) shows modest benefits (8310, 13023, 13691, 69372, 69373, 69374). A meta-analysis of results from eight clinical studies including 574 patients shows that pomegranate juice reduces SBP by about 5 mmHg, but does not affect DBP, when compared with placebo. Doses of pomegranate juice ranged from 43-330 mL daily for 2 weeks to 18 months. Changes in SBP and DBP were not related to the dose or duration of pomegranate juice consumption (96247).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Most oral pomegranate products do not seem to be beneficial for diabetes. It is unclear if pomegranate seed powder is beneficial.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking pomegranate has no effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or plasma levels of insulin, lipids, or fasting glucose when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. Various formulations, including juice, fruit extract, peel extract, and seed oil, were used in these studies (105265). However, a more recent clinical trial shows that drinking a beverage twice daily for 8 weeks, made by soaking a 'tea bag' containing pomegranate seed powder 5 grams in hot water for 10 minutes, modestly reduces levels of fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with placebo. Fasting blood glucose levels were reduced by approximately 4%, compared with a 6% increase in the placebo group (105270).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral pomegranate does not seem to be beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nMost clinical research shows that taking pomegranate does not increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels or reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (13022, 13023, 13690, 69142, 69168, 69276). A meta-analysis of results from 12 clinical studies including 545 patients with or without hyperlipidemia shows that taking pomegranate daily for at least 10 days and up to 1 year does not improve blood lipid levels when compared with placebo. Pomegranate formulations evaluated in these studies include juice, seed oil, whole fruit, extract, and vinegar beverage; no specific form or dose of pomegranate was associated with improvements in cholesterol or triglyceride levels (96248).\n\nOne preliminary clinical study has evaluated pomegranate juice in combination with other fruits. Results from the study show that taking a specific pomegranate-containing combination product (Radical Fruits, Garden of Life) 900 mg orally three times daily before meals reduces total and LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol in males with hypercholesterolemia (69170). However, it is unclear if these benefits are due to pomegranate, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for preventing atherosclerosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice 50 mL daily reduces intima-media thickness of the carotid artery by up to 35% after one year when compared to baseline in patients with atherosclerosis and carotid artery stenosis (13023).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral pomegranate extract is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in trained male cyclists shows that taking pomegranate extract (POM Wonderful LLC) 15 mg/kg daily for 8 days moderately reduces the amount of oxygen needed to perform submaximal exercise when compared with placebo. However, pomegranate extract does not improve performance in a timed trial (99100). Other preliminary clinical research in regionally competitive male cyclists shows that taking pomegranate extract (Pomanox P30, Euromed S.A.) 750 mg daily for 15 days increases the time to exhaustion by 94 seconds after a prolonged submaximal effort, as well as the time to reach the anaerobic threshold by about 55 seconds, when compared with placebo. There was no effect on the restoration of force or on oxygen consumption (101881).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for COPD.\nA small clinical trial shows that drinking pomegranate juice 400 mL daily for 5 weeks does not improve symptoms or respiratory function in patients with COPD when compared with placebo (13692).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for patients with CHD.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful Pomegranate Juice, POM Wonderful LLC) 240 mL daily for 3 months decreases stress-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with CHD. The average improvement in myocardial perfusion was about 17% with pomegranate juice, compared with an 18% worsening of myocardial perfusion in patients taking placebo (13691). However, other preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate CHD risk shows that drinking the same pomegranate juice product 240 mL daily for 18 months does not improve carotid intima-media thickness when compared to control (17329). It is not known if drinking pomegranate juice can prevent or reduce the risk of a myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular outcomes.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with pomegranate extract is beneficial for reducing dental plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that rinsing with pomegranate extract mouthwash for one minute once or twice daily reduces dental plaque in patients with or without fixed orthodontic appliances. The antiplaque activity of pomegranate extract is similar to that of chlorhexidine (69171, 69316).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for ED.\nIn patients with mild-to-moderate ED, preliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms of ED when compared with placebo (69175).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful Pomegranate Juice, POM Wonderful LLC) 250 mL twice daily for 15 days reduces post-exercise muscle soreness in elbow flexor, but not knee extensor, muscles in resistance-rained males when compared with placebo (69355). However, in non-resistance trained males, drinking the same pomegranate juice 250 mL twice daily for 9 days does not reduce exercise-induced muscle damage or delayed onset soreness of elbow flexor muscles when compared with placebo (101880).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral pomegranate for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of pomegranate for this condition.\nInfluenza. Although there has been interest in using oral pomegranate for influenza prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of pomegranate for this purpose.\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for preventing brain injury in IUGR neonates.\nIn patients with an IUGR pregnancy, clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice 8 ounces daily from 24-34 weeks' gestation until delivery reduces the risk of an MRI-diagnosed gray matter brain injury in the infant by approximately 28%. There was no effect on brain volume or white matter injury (105267).\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for patients on hemodialysis; the available research is conflicting.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking pomegranate juice (Nutrafood) 100 mL during the first dialysis treatment hour three times weekly for one year reduces antihypertensive medication requirements and the rate of second hospitalization due to infection when compared with placebo. Consuming pomegranate juice also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with baseline levels of 40 mg/dL or less and reduces triglycerides in patients with baseline levels of at least 200 mg/dL (91698, 91699). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking pomegranate juice 100 mL immediately after dialysis three times weekly for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides by approximately 20%, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5% and 7%, respectively, when compared with baseline. HDL cholesterol was also increased by approximately 23%. These changes were significant when compared with placebo (101882). However, pomegranate juice did not affect total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, liver enzymes, or incidence of cardiovascular events when compared with placebo (91698, 91699, 101882). Other preliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful Pomegranate Juice, POM Wonderful LLC) 100 mL or taking pomegranate juice extract tablets (POM Wonderful LLC) 1050 mg daily prior to each dialysis session for 4 weeks does not improve blood pressure, lipids, or markers of inflammation and oxidative stress when compared to baseline in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (91697). Although the reason for these conflicting findings is not clear, it may have to do with the timing of consumption. The evidence suggests that offering pomegranate during dialysis or after completion of dialysis might be more effective than prior to dialysis.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral pomegranate seed oil or pomegranate extract is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific pomegranate seed oil (Delima, Pekana Naturheilmittel GmbH) 30 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the frequency of hot flashes when compared with placebo in postmenopausal adults experiencing at least 5 hot flashes per day. However, pomegranate seed oil might improve sleep in some patients with sleep disturbances attributed to menopause (91685). A clinical study in healthy, perimenopausal and menopausal adults with untreated menopausal symptoms shows that taking pomegranate extract 3 mL three times daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms, including hot flashes and vertigo, and improves physical and mental quality of life when compared with placebo. Additionally, these improvements were sustained 3 weeks after discontinuing treatment (108484). The validity of this study is limited by the short duration of treatment.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice 240 mL daily for one month improves endothelial dysfunction in adolescents with metabolic syndrome when compared with drinking grape juice 240 mL daily (53174, 69362).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for increasing muscle strength.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific pomegranate extract (POMx, POM Wonderful LLC) 480 mL twice daily modestly improves recovery of strength 2-3 days after eccentric exercise but does not reduce muscle soreness after exercise when compared with placebo (69261).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral pomegranate seed oil or pomegranate extract improves anthropometric measures in adults with NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in overweight and obese adults with NAFLD shows that taking a dried pomegranate extract, standardized to contain 90 mg of ellagic acid, twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body mass index and body weight when compared with placebo. A 5 kg weight reduction occurred in the pomegranate group, compared to a small increase in weight in the placebo group. Pomegranate also improved diastolic blood pressure, as well as lipid and glycemic parameters; however, the patients included in this study had normal baseline parameters, limiting the validity of this finding (108481).\n\nPomegranate has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical crossover study in obese females with NAFLD shows that taking a specific combination product (Xanthigen, Polinat) containing pomegranate seed oil 300 mg and brown marine algae 300 mg (standardized to fucoxanthin 2.4 mg) modestly reduces body weight and liver fat content when compared with placebo (69257).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral pomegranate is beneficial for obesity. Most evidence suggests that it is not beneficial, although some studies have yielded conflicting findings.\nA meta-analysis of 513 participants shows that taking pomegranate extract, juice, or concentrate for 2-26 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, or body fat percentage when compared with placebo or other control (101883). However, most of these studies were not designed to investigate weight as the primary outcome, and some preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese individuals suggests that some pomegranate products might have some benefit. Drinking pomegranate juice 120 mL daily for one month helps these individuals maintain weight when compared with placebo, although it does not appear to improve glucose, insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity (91693).\nless\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. It is unclear if topical pomegranate peel extract is beneficial for oropharyngeal candidiasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with candidiasis associated with denture stomatitis shows that applying a gel containing the extract of pomegranate fruit peel to the gums three times daily for 15 days seems to be as effective as miconazole gel for improving symptoms of candidiasis (13689).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral pomegranate juice is beneficial for PCOS.\nIn patients with PCOS, preliminary clinical research shows that taking pomegranate juice 45 mL daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 10 and 4 mmHg, respectively, when compared with a control group not taking pomegranate juice. Triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were also modestly improved. However, there was no effect on glycemic measures, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels increased by 6 mg/dL (105266). Another clinical trial in patients with PCOS shows that taking synbiotic pomegranate juice containing inulin and lactobacillus as 2 liters weekly for 8 weeks improves insulin sensitivity, body mass index, waist circumference, and testosterone levels when compared with baseline or a control juice. However, patients consuming a drink containing only the synbiotic ingredients experienced the same improvements, whereas patients consuming only regular pomegranate juice experienced no benefits, suggesting that pomegranate was not responsible for these changes (101884).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral pomegranate extract or juice is beneficial for prostate cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that pomegranate might slow prostate cancer progression in some patients after surgery or radiation for prostate cancer. The length of time to doubling of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was longer in those who took a specific pomegranate extract (POMx, POM Wonderful LLC) 1-3 grams daily, as well as those who drank 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily, for up to 24 months (14137, 14388, 91695). However, the results from a large well-designed study do not support these findings. This study shows that taking 8 ounces of a pomegranate liquid extract does not increase the length of time to doubling of PSA (105271). In patients with favorable-risk localized prostate cancer, a small clinical trial also shows that taking pomegranate fruit extract (POMx, POM Wonderful) 1000 mg daily for 12 months does not affect the length of time to doubling of PSA, although there were some changes in tumor markers of DNA damage (105269).\n\nPomegranate has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research in patients with localized prostate cancer shows that taking a combination supplement containing pomegranate powder 100 mg, broccoli powder 100 mg, turmeric powder 100 mg, and green tea extract 20 mg daily for 6 months slows the increase in PSA levels when compared with placebo (89730). It is not clear if this effect is due to pomegranate, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral pomegranate extract is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific pomegranate extract (POMx, POM Wonderful LLC) 5 mL twice daily for 12 weeks decreases disease activity and reduces tender joint count by 62% when compared to baseline in patients with RA (91686). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nRhinosinusitis. It is unclear if intranasal pomegranate extract is beneficial for chronic rhinosinusitis.\nA clinical study in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis or rhinitis persisting longer than 12 weeks, with or without the presence of nasal polyps, shows that using a nasal spray containing pomegranate extract in an unknown dose twice daily for 30 days does not improve objective or subjective nasal or sinus symptoms when compared with placebo nasal spray. In a subgroup of patients with chronic rhinitis, including allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, improvement in thick nasal discharge is also observed in those receiving the pomegranate nasal spray; however, the study does not report outcomes for each subtype of rhinitis (108480).\nless\nStroke. Although there has been interest in using oral pomegranate for stroke recovery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of pomegranate for this purpose.\nSunburn. It is unclear if oral pomegranate extract is beneficial for sunburn prevention.\nA small clinical study shows that taking pomegranate extract standardized to contain ellagic acid 100-200 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce skin pigmentation caused by UV light exposure when compared with placebo (69172). However, this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference between treatments.\nless\nTrichomoniasis. It is unclear if oral pomegranate extract is beneficial for trichomoniasis.\nA very small clinical study in patients with vaginal Trichomoniasis suggests that taking pomegranate extract might help to eradicate Trichomonas vaginalis infection (69286). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size, unclear reporting, and lack of a control group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate pomegranate for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPomegranate juice has most often been used in doses of 50-240 mL daily for up to 3 months. Pomegranate fruit extract has been used in doses of up to 3 grams daily for up to 18 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nThe pomegranate juice most often used in clinical trials (POM Wonderful juice) is standardized to deliver 650 mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 mL (91697).\nTopical:\nPomegranate extracts have been used as a mouthwash or oral gel. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nA majority of clinical trials evaluating pomegranate have used juice or extracts supplied by POM Wonderful (13691, 14388, 17329, 69175, 69261, 69355, 69372, 69373, 91686, 91695)(91697, 99100, 101880). Forty percent of the polyphenols in POM Wonderful juice are flavonoids such as anthocyanins, catechins, and phenols (14388). POM Wonderful juice 100 mL is standardized to deliver 650 mg gallic acid equivalents (91697). Generally, the gallic acid equivalents in various POM Wonderful extracts are 61% to 62% of the total measured polyphenols, which range from 650-1050 mg (17729, 69261, 91695, 91697).\n\nSome clinical trials have evaluated pomegranate juice containing 1979 mg/L tannins, 384 mg/L anthocyanins, 121 mg/L ellagic acids, and 30 mg/L vitamin C (13023, 13690). In another trial, pomegranate juice provided 1946 mg/L total polyphenols and 346 mg/L total flavonoids (69374). Pomegranate juice providing 0.7 mmol, 1.5 mmol, or 0.33 grams total polyphenols for every 50 mL of juice has also been used (8310, 13692, 69142, 91698, 91699).\n\nCommercial pomegranate juice products may be adulterated to improve taste and color. Additionally, pomegranate juice is in high demand and short supply, so some manufacturers may add other fruit juices to extend their supply. Fruit juices that may be added to pomegranate juice include apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, and aronia. To improve the color of poor-quality pomegranate juices, natural grape pigments or highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices may be added. Non-pomegranate sugars may also be added to improve taste of poor-quality pomegranate juices (92019).\n\nSome clinical trials have evaluated standardized pomegranate seed oil products (69276, 91685). In one of these studies, each 30 mg capsule of pomegranate seed oil (Delima, Pekana Naturheilmittel GmbH) was found to contain 127 mcg of steroidal phytoestrogens, including 3-beta-sitosterol 2739 mg/kg, campesterol 281 mg/kg, and stigmasterol 244 mg/kg (91685).\n\nPomegranate extracts have also been used. In one clinical trial, the pomegranate fruit extract (Pomanox) contained 30% punicalagins, providing 112.5 mg alpha plus beta punicalagins per capsule (101881). Standardization of pomegranate extract supplements based on their ellagic acid content does not guarantee pomegranate supplement authenticity, as supplements may contain ellagic acid from less expensive plant sources (92020).",

However, there is contradictory evidence about the effect of whole pomegranate juice on CYP3A4 activity. In vitro, pomegranate juice significantly inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, with comparable inhibition to grapefruit juice (13188, 16711, 17326). In an animal model, pomegranate juice inhibits CYP3A4 metabolism of carbamazepine and increases levels of carbamazepine by 1.5 times (13188); however, in human volunteers, drinking a single glass of pomegranate juice 240 mL or taking 200 mL daily for 2 weeks does not significantly affect levels of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam after oral or intravenous administration (16711, 17730). Another study in healthy volunteers shows that consuming pomegranate juice 300 mL three times daily for three days also does not significantly affect levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate (16712, 91696) This suggests that pomegranate is unlikely to significantly affect levels of CYP3A4 substrates in humans (17326).\nless\nROSUVASTATIN (Crestor)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, taking pomegranate with rosuvastatin might increase the risk of adverse effects.\nIn one case, a patient taking rosuvastatin 5 mg every other day in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg daily developed rhabdomyolysis after drinking pomegranate juice 200 mL twice weekly for 3 weeks. This patient had a history of elevated creatine kinase levels while not receiving any statin treatment. This suggests a possible underlying myopathy and predisposition to rhabdomyolysis (14465).\nless\nTOLBUTAMIDE (Orinase)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, pomegranate might increase levels of tolbutamide, although research suggests this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nAnimal research shows that pomegranate juice inhibits the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) metabolism of tolbutamide. Pomegranate juice increased tolbutamide levels by 1.2 times without prolonging the elimination half-life. This suggests that pomegranate juice inhibits intestinal CYP2C9, but might not inhibit hepatic CYP2C9 (17327). Despite this evidence, clinical research shows that neither pomegranate juice nor pomegranate extract have a significant effect on CYP2C9 activity in humans (91694). This interaction does not appear to be clinically significant in humans.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, pomegranate might increase warfarin levels and increase the risk of bleeding. Also, discontinuing regular consumption of pomegranate juice might decrease warfarin levels.\nIn one case report, a patient had a stable, therapeutic bleeding time, as measured by international normalized ratio (INR), while taking warfarin in combination with pomegranate juice 2-3 times per week. The patient became subtherapeutic within about 10 days after discontinuing pomegranate juice, which required a warfarin dose increase (17328). In another case report, a patient with a stable INR for over one year presented with an INR of 14. The patient noted no changes to medications or diet but did report consuming around 3 liters of pomegranate juice over the previous week. The patient's INR stabilized upon moderation of pomegranate juice consumption (24273). The mechanism of this potential interaction is unclear.\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOTENSIVE EFFECTS\nTheoretically, pomegranate might have hypotensive effects.\nConsuming pomegranate juice can modestly lower blood pressure (8310, 13023, 69373, 69374).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nPresentation of overdose with pomegranate root or stem bark has not been described in humans. However, the bark contains the piperidine alkaloids pelletierine, pseudopelletierine, isopelletierine, and methyl isopelletierine. These alkaloids have muscle relaxant properties that have been associated with paralysis and death in animals (13687, 13694, 13695).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with pomegranate.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn healthy subjects, the consumption of pomegranate juice for five days did not result in detectable plasma levels of punicalagin or ellagic acid (69152). In another study, ellagic acid was detected in the plasma of all subjects, with a maximum concentration of 0.06 mcM/L and an area under concentration time curve of 0.17 mcM/h/L. The maximum concentration occurred at 1 hour, with an elimination half-life of about 42 minutes (69165).\n\nIn healthy volunteers, oral consumption of pomegranate juice, liquid, and powder extracts were found to provide similar levels of plasma ellagitannin metabolites (69192). The time to maximum concentration was delayed for the powder extract, occurring at approximately 2.6 hours when compared to the juice and liquid extract (69192).\nMetabolism\nIn healthy subjects, ellagic acid metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), were detected in conjugated and free forms (69165). Ellagitannins found in pomegranate juice are metabolized by gut flora into urolithins (69184).\nExcretion\nIn clinical research, pomegranate polyphenols were detected in the urine of all participants (14388). In healthy subjects, the consumption of pomegranate juice for five days resulted in the presence of three microbial ellagitannin-derived metabolites in urine after one day of use: 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, an unidentified aglycone, and hydroxy-6-H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide (69152). Total urine excretion of metabolites ranged from 0.7% to 52.7%. In clinical research, DMEAG was found in the urine following pomegranate consumption, as were urolithin A- and B-glucuronide (69165, 105269). In healthy volunteers, pomegranate juice, liquid, and powder extracts were found to provide similar levels of urinary ellagitannin metabolites. Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, reached approximately 1,000 ng/mL for all three interventions (69192).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of pomegranate are the fruit, fruit juice, seed, seed oil, bark, rind, root, stem, leaf, and flower (1287, 13693). One pomegranate delivers nearly 30 mg of vitamin C (4844, 92015). Pomegranate flowers contain anthocyanins and beta-sitosterol esters (69273, 69390). The pomegranate fruit husk contains up to 28% tannins. It contains large amounts of ellagitannins and gallotannins and the hydrolyzable tannins, punicalagin and punicalin (13024). The red color of pomegranate fruit peel is mostly due to anthocyanin content (69354). Polyphenols, including flavonoids, have been extracted from pomegranate peels (69142, 69358, 69379, 69400). The main polyphenols found in pomegranate peel are pulicalagin (69401) and punicalagin. Ellagic acid was found in the rinds (69319) and peel (69302). Pomegranate peel also contains the peptide pomegranin (69217).\n\nPomegranate juice typically contains 0.2% to 1% polyphenols. These polyphenols primarily include anthocyanidins such as delphinidin, cyanidin, pelargonidin, and hydrolyzable tannins including punicalin, pedunculagin, punicalagin, gallagic, and ellagic acid (13022, 13211, 15182, 69391, 69395, 69396). Pomegranate juice contains more polyphenols than red wine, green tea, blueberry, cranberry, or orange juice (13025). Pomegranate juice contains significant amounts of sugar, ascorbic acid, citric acid, vitamin B, pectin, cellulose, tannin, and ash. Commercially prepared pomegranate juice has been shown to contain an increased content of the rind constituents, punicalagins (69397) and ellagic acid (69376).\n\nPomegranate leaves contain large amounts of ellagitannins and gallotannins. Apigenin, luteolin glycosides, and a glucoside have also been isolated (13024, 69325). The root or stem bark of pomegranate contains the toxic alkaloid pelletierine and up to 25% tannins. The bark also contains large amounts of ellagitannins and gallotannins (13024). Pomegranate seeds contain estrone and other nonsteroidal estrogenic substances (8311). The seed oil contains polyphenols, including the anthocyanidins delphinidin, cyanidin, pelargonidin, as well as fatty acids, including punicic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid (1287, 15179, 40896, 69311, 69345, 69402, 69404, 69405).\nAnalgesic effects\nSome animal research suggests that ellagic acid, a constituent of pomegranate fruit has analgesic effects, possibly through a non-anti-inflammatory pathway (69376, 69377).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of pomegranate and its extracts have been demonstrated in a variety of human, animal, and in vitro studies (1287, 69187, 69188, 69216, 69220, 69235, 69240, 69254, 69278, 69308)(69332, 69357, 69371, 69407, 99099, 105268). In human research, the anti-inflammatory effects of pomegranate extract were associated with beneficial changes in the gut microbiota (99099). These effects are likely due to regulation of inflammatory proteins and suppression of inflammatory mediators (69327). These include the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity (1287, 69188), lipoxygenase activity (1287), nitric oxide (NO) production (69220, 69371), nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity (69216, 69220, 69278, 69325, 69357), Erk1/2 activation (69220), IL-1beta activation (69308), IL-8 synthesis (69220), IL-6 synthesis (101882), prostaglandin E2 synthesis (69220), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation (69216), neutrophil myeloperoxidase (69332), and the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma and-alpha (69254). A meta-analysis of human research shows that pomegranate supplementation reduces levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but not CRP itself or other inflammatory mediators (105268).\nAntiallergic effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that a standardized pomegranate rind extract (SPRE) containing 13% w/w ellagic acid may have antiallergic effects. SPRE inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase from antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia cells (69371).\nAntiatherogenic effects\nClinical research suggests that pomegranate reduces stress-induced ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease and decreases carotid intima-media thickness in patients with atherosclerosis (13023, 13691). The antioxidant effects may contribute to decreased macrophage activity in atherosclerotic plaques and reduced lipid peroxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (8309, 13690). Some clinical research also suggests that pomegranate reduces platelet aggregation through an interaction of constituents in pomegranate juice and collagen-binding sites on platelet surfaces. This might also be explained by the free radical-scavenging ability of pomegranate (69142). Animal and in vitro research suggests that pomegranate polyphenols may protect LDL cholesterol against cell-mediated oxidation via direct interaction of the polyphenols with the lipoprotein and/or an indirect effect through the accumulation of polyphenols in arterial macrophages. Pomegranate also seems to reduce atherosclerotic lesion size and vascular inflammation in animal research (13698, 69142, 69146, 69158, 69162, 69167, 69174). In vitro, pomegranate juice and polyphenol extract (POMx; POM Wonderful) were shown to reduce platelet aggregation, calcium mobilization, thromboxane A2 production, and hydrogen peroxide formation (69230).\nAnticoagulant effects\nPreliminary in vitro research suggests that pomegranate fruit extracts, primarily ellagic acid, may have a potential role in the regulation of various physiopathological processes involving thrombin (or thrombin-like proteinase) (69224).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nAqueous and alcoholic extracts of powdered pomegranate rind and seed seem to decrease diarrhea in animal research (69383, 69141). In other animal research, pomegranate appears to minimize ethanol-induced gastritis (69365).\nAntifungal effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that pomegranate might act as a topical antifungal agent for the treatment of candidiasis associated with denture stomatitis (13689), although the mechanism of action is unclear. In vitro research shows that pomegranate peel exhibits antifungal activity against two strains of Aspergillus parasiticus (69380) and Candida albicans (69306, 69289). Other in vitro research shows that pomegranate is effective against Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus ochraceus growth (69348). Pomegranin, a peptide from pomegranate peel, has been found to have antifungal activity (69217). Menthol extracts of several plants, including pomegranate, have been shown to exert antifungal activity against Candida species (69313). Clinical and in vitro research suggests that pomegranate may be effective against Trichomonas vaginalis (69286).\nAntimalarial effects\nIn vitro research shows that ellagitannins of pomegranate fruit rind inhibit the host inflammatory response mechanisms during the onset of malaria (69295).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome preliminary research suggests pomegranate extracts have antibacterial and antifungal activity (12666, 13689, 13702, 69371). In vitro studies have shown pomegranate to have antimicrobial activity against regular and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (15180, 69364, 69242, 69232, 69247, 69371, 69378, 69243), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (69364, 69333, 69255, 69322, 69232), Clostridia (69247), Candida albicans (69364, 69232, 69219), Helicobacter pylori (69360), Escherichia coli (69379, 69380, 69277, 69242, 69232), Flavobacterium columnare (69290), Salmonella sp. (69246), Bacillus sp. (69211, 69232, 69381), Aspergillus niger (69382), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (69382), Lactobacillus plantarum (69336), Listeria monocytogenes (69263, 69242), Yersinia enterocolitica (69242), Proteus mirabilis (69211), and several other pathogenic organisms (69144, 69232, 69371).\n\nPomegranate components also showed anthelmintic activity against Entamoeba species (69326). In some research, aqueous extract of the pericarp of pomegranate was found to have the most antimicrobial activity, followed by that of the leaf, flower, and seed (69408). Other research shows that pomegranate peel (rind) extract has shown the highest antimicrobial activity compared to extracts of other parts of the plant (69409). Pomegranate may exert antimicrobial activity via inhibition of quorum sensing (QS), which is a mechanism used by certain opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in determining virulence gene expression (69339, 69321).\nAntimutagenic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that pomegranate peel and flower may possess antimutagenic effects (60041, 69297).\nAntineoplastic effects\nPomegranate juice, peel, and oil may interfere with tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion, and angiogenesis, which may be explained by pomegranate's anti-inflammatory effects (69169). Flavonoid-rich polyphenol fractions from pomegranate exert antiproliferative, anti-invasive, anti-eicosanoid, and proapoptotic actions in breast, prostate, and other cancer cell lines, as well as in animal models (13703, 13211, 13701, 69163, 69155, 69154). They also have antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo (69150, 69151).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that pomegranate may have a role in prostate cancer prevention (14137, 14388, 91695). Pomegranate fruit extracts inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis of aggressive prostate cancer cells in vitro. Pomegranate fruit extracts also seem to reduce prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in animals implanted with prostate cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in animal and in vitro studies (13211, 15184, 69177, 69185, 69196, 69259, 69310, 69351). Pomegranate constituents have also been found to be cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells via inhibition of CYP1B1 activity (69260). According to epidemiological research, urolithin glucuronides and dimethyl ellagic acid found in pomegranate may be responsible for effects against prostate cancer (69278).\n\nOther research suggests that fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols and other pomegranate extracts have activity against malignant breast cancer cells (13703, 13704). In vitro and animal studies show that constituents of pomegranate may inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer and other models (69369, 69301, 69267, 69268, 69314, 69252).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that pomegranate extracts may inhibit carcinogenesis in the colon (69264, 69269). Additionally, pomegranate juice has been reported to inhibit sulfoconjugation in human colon carcinoma cells in vitro (69210). Pomegranate juice, total pomegranate ellagitannins, and punicalagin all suppress inflammatory cell signaling in colon cancer cells (69161).\n\nPomegranate seed oil seems to have activity against skin cancer cells (13705). In mice, pomegranate fruit extract may inhibit early biomarkers of UVB radiation-induced carcinogenesis (69307).\n\nPomegranate extract was capable of inducing apoptosis (69314) in leukemia cells in vitro (69331). Punicanolic acid isolated from pomegranate flowers may have tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inhibiting activity (69205). Whole pomegranate juice seems to be more effective against oral, colon, and prostate cancer cells in vitro than its individual constituents (13701). However, according to in vitro research, pomegranate extract is less effective than extracts of rowanberry, raspberry, lingonberry, cloudberry, arctic bramble, and strawberry in terms of antiproliferative effects against cervical and colon cancer cells (69181).\nAntioxidant effects\nPomegranate has demonstrated antioxidant activity in human, animal, and in vitro studies (13023, 69142, 69361, 101882).\n\nMany in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that pomegranate fruit and its components (69234, 69186, 69199, 69191, 69194, 69222, 69226, 31459, 69353, 69334)(69329, 69281, 69253), including extracts from the peel and rind (69249, 69241, 69302, 69200, 69323, 69410, 69401, 69382, 69411, 69412)(69379, 69346, 69297, 69279, 69248, 69236, 69191, 69413), seed (15179, 69410, 69414, 69406, 69415, 69416, 69349, 69279, 69249), pericarp (69201), bark (69417), flowers (69390, 69206), leaves (69418, 69249), pulp (69249, 69200), and juice (69251, 69417, 69213, 69419, 69420, 69421, 69178, 69418, 69396, 69352)(69322, 69318, 69287, 69256, 69250, 69208, 69207), possess antioxidant activities.\n\nSome research shows that pomegranate inner and outer peels are more powerful antioxidants than the juice or crushed seeds (69142). Some in vitro research also shows that commercially prepared pomegranate juice exhibits stronger antioxidant activity than hand-processed pomegranate (13024).\n\nIn vitro, pomegranate polyphenols increased paraoxonase-2 activity (69173, 69162, 69147) and reduced oxidized LDL uptake by peritoneal macrophages and cellular total peroxide content (69162). Pomegranate sugars decreased macrophage peroxide levels and paraoxonase-2 activity and increased cellular glutathione (69159). In vitro, beneficial effects of pomegranate on nitric oxide levels were likely due to its antioxidant protective effects and enhancement of nitric-oxide synthase (NOSIII) bioactivity (69164, 69160). Nitric oxide synthase increases the availability of nitric oxide, an antioxidant and vasodilator (13698). Some clinical research suggests that drinking pomegranate juice 50-330 mL or taking pomegranate extract 250-1000 mg for a duration of 2 weeks to 1 year might reduce levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as increase total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase, when compared with control or no supplementation. A subgroup analysis shows that reduction in MDA levels is only observed in studies using pomegranate juice, those with a treatment duration of at least 8 weeks, and those evaluating individuals with at least one underlying condition. There was also a modest increase in plasma glutathione peroxidase in studies with a follow-up of at least 8 weeks and in individuals with at least one underlying condition (108483).\n\nThe antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice can be as much as three times higher than red wine or green tea (13024).\nAntiparasitic effects\nSome in vitro and in vivo research suggests that pomegranate extracts have potential antiparasitic activity against schistosomula and mature worms of Schistosoma mansoni (69422). Pomegranate extracts were shown to inhibit the growth of intracellular amastigotes and may have a role in the prevention of Leishmania amazonensis infection (69299). In vitro, but not in vivo, research demonstrated antiparasitic and antimalarial effects by pomegranate fruit rind, partially via inhibition of plasmepsin-2 (69239).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research suggests pomegranate juice might have activity against HIV. Its constituents seem to target the viral envelope and prevent viral entry into cells (13697, 15183). Pomegranate also seems to have activity against influenza virus. In vitro, a pomegranate polyphenol extract (PPE) has virucidal effects, inhibits replication of virus, and inhibits virus agglutination of red blood cells. The polyphenol punicalagin appears to be the active constituent against influenza. The anti-influenza effects appear to be synergistic with the prescription antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (17330). Tannins from pomegranate have shown antiviral activity against the herpes simplex-2 virus (HSV-2). In vitro tests have shown that tannins from the pericarp of pomegranate inhibit HSV-2 replication, kill the virus, and block its adsorption to cells (69363). In vitro research also suggests that pomegranate juice may be effective against several foodborne viruses, including feline calicivirus, murine norovirus (69300), although the exact mechanism for this effect remains unclear. In laboratory research, polyphenols from pomegranate have been associated with activity against the influenza virus (17330, 69294), likely due to changes in envelope glycoproteins (69294).\nBone effects\nPomegranate ethanol extract has been shown to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation in vitro (69215).\nCardiovascular effects\nEpidemiological evidence suggests that the cardioprotective properties of fruits such as pomegranate may be partially due to their polyphenol content (69309). In animal research, the water extract of a pomegranate peel decreased heart rate and cardiac electrical activity (69370). In animal research, the whole fruit extract of pomegranate decreased doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (69335). The extract decreased the QT, increased the heart rate, and decreased CK-MB and LDH vs. animals given doxorubicin alone. GSH levels were increased, and histopathology indicated cardioprotection. In animal research, pomegranate juice showed a significantly lesser increase in the heart weight, infarct size, plasma marker enzymes, and lipid peroxidation vs. rats not given pomegranate juice but given isoproterenol alone to induce cardiac necrosis (69287).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nSome preliminary clinical evidence suggests that pomegranate might improve cholesterol in some patients (13022, 69168, 69276); however, other clinical research is conflicting (13022, 13023, 13690, 69142, 69168, 69276, 96248). Pomegranate juice might reduce cholesterol due to its polyphenol constituents. It is thought that polyphenols might decrease cholesterol synthesis in the liver (13022). Additionally, pomegranate leaf contains tannins. Pomegranate leaf extract is thought to have antihyperlipidemic and anti-obesity effects, possibly by inhibiting pancreatic lipase and decreasing energy intake. In an animal model of obesity, pomegranate leaf extract reduced weight, caloric intake, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (15298). Consumption of pomegranate juice has resulted in LDL modifications, including prolongation of LDL oxidation time, reduction of LDL aggregation, and reduction of LDL retention (entrapment of LDL in arterial walls) in vitro (69142). Pomegranate juice reduced cellular lipoprotein degradation and cholesterol esterification rates and increased macrophage cholesterol efflux in mice (8309). In an animal diabetic model, a pomegranate flower extract reduced total, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased HDL cholesterol (69204). Reductions in plasma lipids due to peel powder have been shown in other animal research (69423). Reductions in plasma lipids due to fruit juice and seed oil were not shown in animal research (69424). In vitro, transport of ellagic acid into HepG2 cells occurred in correlation with cholesterol alteration (69214).\nDermatologic effects\nSome preliminary research suggests pomegranate might be useful for cosmetics purposes for aging skin. An extract of the pomegranate peel seems to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-1, which destroys collagen in aged skin, and to increase the activity of procollagen production by dermal fibroblasts. Pomegranate seed oil seems to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation (13700). In vitro, pomegranate extract resulted in increased collagen synthesis and decreased expression of MMP-1 after UVB treatment of skin fibroblasts (69284). Protective effects against UVA and UVB toxicity have been shown in other in vitro and animal models following treatment with pomegranate constituents (69270, 69193), as well as in models of human reconstituted skin (69223).In vitro, pomegranate extract inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity, which suggests that pomegranate may have a role in the treatment of hyperpigmentation (43510).\nErectile function effects\nWhile preliminary clinical research shows that drinking pomegranate juice daily for 4 weeks does not improve erectile dysfunction in men with mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction (69175), other clinical research in men with atherosclerosis shows that pomegranate extract might improve intracavernosal blood flow, erectile activity, smooth muscle relaxation, and fibrosis. Pomegranate's antioxidant and gene effects may explain these results (69291). Preliminary research in animal models suggests the antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice might help prevent arteriogenic erectile dysfunction (13699).\nErgogenic effects\nIn humans, pomegranate extract has some benefits on athletic performance. Pomegranate increases levels of plasma nitrate, a precursor to nitric oxide which acts as a vasodilator. Pomegranate also contains polyphenols which act as antioxidants, possibly preventing the breakdown of nitric oxide (99100).\nFertility effects\nIn animal research, pomegranate juice increased epididymal sperm concentration, sperm motility, spermatogenic cell density, the diameter of seminiferous tubules, and germinal cell layer thickness, and decreased the abnormal sperm rate. The mechanisms of action may include antioxidant effects (69384, 69178). Beneficial effects of pomegranate on sperm parameters were also noted in a lead toxicity animal model (69338).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggests that pomegranate and its extracts have gastroprotective effects, most likely due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity (15181, 69225, 69244, 69245, 69304, 69365, 69385). Additional animal research shows that pomegranate juice prevents intestinal histopathological changes following infection with Aeromonas hydrophila (69386).\nHematological effects\nIn animal research, pomegranate seed extract increased erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit and decreased percentage rates of total lymphocytes and ANAE-positive lymphocytes (69389).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal diabetic and obesity model, pomegranate flower extract reduced the weight of the liver, as well as liver triglyceride and lipid droplets (69228). Mechanisms of action may include enhanced hepatic gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and reduced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1. Hepatoprotective effects of pomegranate flower infusion, including beneficial effects on AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, tissue malondialdehyde, and GST levels, have been shown in animal research (69206).\nHormonal effects\nIn vitro research suggests that the linolenic acid isomers punicic acid and alpha-eleostearic acid from pomegranate seed are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (69272). Clinical research in active, young adult males show that taking 200-400 mg of a specific combination product (Tesnor; Laila Nutraceuticals) containing extracts of pomegranate rind and cocoa seed for 56 days increases levels of free and total testosterone, when compared with placebo. Additionally, patients taking the 400-mg dose show faster increases in testosterone when compared with the 200-mg dose, and modest increases in levels of luteinizing hormone at day 56, when compared with placebo. No effect was observed on levels of dihydrotestosterone, cortisol, or estradiol, regardless of dose (108485). It is unclear if any changes are due to pomegranate seed, cocoa seed, or the combination.\nHypoglycemic effects\nAlthough animal research suggests that pomegranate may lower blood glucose levels (69143, 69191, 69204, 69198), and one small clinical study suggests that a single dose of pomegranate juice reduces fasting plasma glucose, improves beta-cell function, and decreases insulin resistance (91691), most clinical research shows that regular consumption of pomegranate has no effect on fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (69195, 105265). However, it may reduce oxidative stress, thiol groups, HDL-associated PON-1 activity, and PON-1 binding to HDL (69195). Preliminary research also suggests that pomegranate flower extract has alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activity (13696).\nHypotensive effects\nSome clinical research suggests that pomegranate juice can reduce the serum activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and reduce blood pressure in some patients (8310, 13023, 69373, 69374). The serum activity of ACE is reduced approximately 36%, with incremental decreases occurring in patients already taking ACE inhibitors (8310). In an angiotensin II animal diabetic model, pomegranate juice reduced the mean arterial blood pressure and induced vascular reactivity changes, likely due to its antioxidant effects and inhibition of ACE activity (69265).\nImmune effects\nSome animal research suggests that pomegranate may stimulate the immune system (69145, 69274, 69293, 69298). However, in vitro research shows that punicalagin, an ellagitannin found in pomegranate, may have immunosuppressive effects (69183).\nKidney effects\nIn an animal nephrotoxicity model, pomegranate seed oil resulted in decreased serum creatinine, urea, urine glucose, and urine protein; however, the mechanism of these effects is unclear (69285).\nMemory effects\nSome animal research suggests that pomegranate peel extract and pomegranate juice may have neuroprotective effects and improve memory, possibly through glucose-lowering and antioxidant effects (69387, 69427).\nNeurological effects\nSome animal research shows that pomegranate juice decreases the accumulation of soluble Abeta42 and amyloid deposition in the hippocampus, suggesting a potential role in Alzheimer's disease (69166). In other animal research, mice exposed to pomegranate juice in utero had less brain damage than controls (13686). Anxiolytic and antinociceptive effects, increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep time and immobility were noted in animals receiving pomegranate seed extract; antioxidant effects were implicated (69221).\nUterine stimulant effects\nAnimal research suggests that pomegranate may have uterine stimulant effects; however the mechanism of this effect is unknown (11020).\nWeight loss effects\nPomegranate leaf extract is thought to have antihyperlipidemic and anti-obesity effects, possibly by inhibiting pancreatic lipase and decreasing energy intake. In an animal model of obesity, pomegranate leaf extract reduced weight, caloric intake, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (15298). According to animal research, pomegranate flower extract may exert activity against diabetes and obesity-associated fatty liver by activating hepatic expression of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation (69228). Pomegranate seed oil has been found to reduce weight gain in mice and may reduce risk for type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity (69212). In other animal research, pomegranate seed oil resulted in reduced body weight (decreased body fat); the mechanism of action did not include reduced food intake, energy expenditure, or liver insulin sensitivity but involved peripheral insulin sensitivity improvements (69340). Additional animal research shows that pomegranate seed oil during high-fat feedings increases concentration of leptin and decreases concentration of adiponectin (69212). In other animal research, feeding polyphenols from pomegranate extract had a lack of effect on body weight gain during the first 30 days but decreased weight gain and dry matter intake thereafter (69298).\nWound-healing effects\nPomegranate seems to have wound healing properties. In animal models, an extract of pomegranate peels formulated into a gel and applied topically appears to improve wound healing (15185). Hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from pomegranate peels has exhibited healing effects on dermal wounds in vivo (69343). The diethyl ether extract of pomegranate flowers seems to improve wound healing in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (69305)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Poppy seed is an oilseed isolated from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). This plant is grown in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Turkey, Spain, France, Germany, and Croatia (96901). Poppy seed is used worldwide in cooking and baking (90847, 90848, 90849). The seed pod of the poppy plant contains opium, a latex fluid that contains opiates including morphine and codeine. While poppy seeds do not contain opiates naturally, the seeds can become coated with opiates during harvesting or damage by insects (90847, 90848, 90849, 104521).",

Poppy seed has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US for use as a spice or flavoring (4912). Food products containing up to about 50 grams of poppy seed can be consumed with apparent safety (27258).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. A single beverage or yogurt containing poppy seed 35-250 grams has been used safely in clinical research (27241, 27546, 27547). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of poppy seed when used in medicinal amounts, long-term.\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in very large amounts. One death due to bowel impaction has been reported following the consumption of at least 900 grams of poppy seed (96901). ...when tea (i.e., extract) of poppy seed is used orally. Three deaths due to morphine intoxication have been reported for patients who drank home-brewed tea prepared from poppy seed. The surface of poppy seed can be contaminated with opium alkaloids, including morphine, codeine, oripavine, and thebaine, during harvesting of the opium latex. These alkaloids can be extracted from the seeds during tea preparation. Poppy seed tea is typically prepared by soaking 1-2 lbs (450-900 grams) of poppy seeds in large amounts of water. Lethal amounts of morphine have been identified in teas prepared by heating as little as 85 grams of poppy seeds in 150 mL of water (96900, 96902, 104521).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used as a spice or flavoring in amounts commonly found in foods.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, poppy seeds are generally well tolerated when consumed in food amounts. Poppy seeds also seem to be well tolerated when used short-term in medicinal amounts. Consuming a large amount of poppy seeds or poppy seed tea may be unsafe.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Allergic reactions, including dyspnea, mucosal swelling, and urticaria, in sensitive individuals.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Intestinal obstruction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration pneumonitis, cardiotoxicity, and death at high doses.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, poppy seed may cause acute cardiotoxicity when used in very large amounts. A 21-year-old male was found unresponsive and transferred to the emergency department after ingesting \"large quantities\" of homemade poppy seed tea. In additional to typical symptoms of opioid overdose, including respiratory depression and altered consciousness, echocardiogram and electrocardiogram showed severe biventricular dysfunction and ST-segment elevations similar to a Brugada-type pattern. The patient slowly recovered upon treatment with naloxone, milrinone, and noradrenaline (111123).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, poppy seed can cause intestinal obstruction with fecal impaction when used in very large amounts. A case of bowel obstruction and subsequent death due to complications of bowel obstruction has been reported for a 54-year-old female who ingested at least 900 grams of poppy seed. The patient experienced severe intractable vomiting 1-2 days prior to death, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance resulting in arrhythmia (96901).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, allergic reactions to poppy seed have included vomiting and swelling of the oral mucosa, urticaria, respiratory distress, and dyspnea (27282).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, poppy seed may cause symptoms of opiate impairment when large amounts are sucked or prepared as poppy seed tea (27274). Although poppy seeds do not naturally contain opiates, poppy seeds can become coated with opiates during harvesting or by insect damage (90847, 90848, 90849). Drinking tea prepared by soaking 250 mg to 3 kg of poppy seeds in water, usually for about 1-2 hours, has been associated with symptoms of opiate impairment including feelings of calmness and euphoria. The symptoms reportedly start within 60 minutes of ingestion and can last up to 24 hours (27274). In rare cases, poppy seed intake has been associated with dependence (27261, 27275). One case of poppy seed dependence has been reported for a female patient who regularly sucked on large amounts of poppy seeds. The patient reported tingling sensations followed by euphoria after filling her mouth with poppy seeds and sucking until the seeds were dry. On average, the patient sucked on about 2 kg of poppy seed weekly. Over time, the patient began sucking on poppy seeds up to six times daily. She experienced restlessness if she used poppy seeds less often (27261). Cases of poppy seed tea dependence have also been reported for patients with opioid dependence who maintained their dependence using the tea (27275). Consuming poppy seeds in food amounts does not cause symptoms of opiate impairment, although it can cause positive opiate urinalysis results (27252).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nThree fatalities attributed to morphine overdose have been reported in individuals who consumed poppy seed tea.

Accurate diagnoses are observed in 94.6% to 100% of patients diagnosed using poppy seed compared with 8.5% to 80% of patients diagnosed using other procedures, such as a chromium-51 nuclear study or computerized tomography. The poppy seed test involves having a patient with suspected vesicoenteric fistula consume approximately 35-250 grams of poppy seed mixed in a beverage or yogurt and monitoring the urine for the subsequent 48 hours.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "OPIOID DRUG TESTING\nSome evidence shows that eating poppy seed can result in positive tests for opiates based on urine, hair, or oral fluid analysis (27252, 27530, 27531). Although the amount of poppy seed on a bagel, muffin, or roll (approximately 1-3 grams) does not appear to be enough to cause a false positive in some research (27253, 27262), conflicting evidence exists (27254, 27256). Also, the amount of poppy seed contained in foods such as poppy seed cake, streusel, paste, or filling (approximately 15-100 grams) may result in a false positive opiate test (27253, 27257, 27258, 27262, 27526). The type of seed appears to affect the risk of false positive testing (27259). Some research shows that thebaine, a natural constituent of poppy seed, is found in urine following poppy seed ingestion but not heroin use, suggesting its use as a test to differentiate poppy seed consumption from heroin use (27265). However, other research shows that measurable levels of thebaine are not found in the urine following poppy seed ingestion (27266). Some research shows that 6-acetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin that is a derivative of morphine, may be used as a marker to differentiate heroin use from other types of opiate exposure, such as poppy seed, morphine, and codeine (27267, 27268, 27269).\nless",

Cardiotoxicity has also been associated with the consumption of large amounts of poppy seed tea (111123).\nTreatment\nTreatment of overdose with poppy seed involves supportive, symptomatic care and the use of naloxone, an opioid antagonist. In one case, a 21-year-old male with typical symptoms of opioid overdose along with cardiotoxicity due to the consumption of large amounts of poppy seed tea recovered after treatment with naloxone, milrinone, and noradrenaline (111123).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, maximal serum levels of morphine (100 ng/mL) occur 2 hours after ingestion of poppy seed 25 grams, with detection up to 24 hours (27527). Serum concentrations of codeine range from 4-11 ng/mL 3 hours after ingestion of poppy seed 25 grams (27527). A home-brewed tea of washed poppy seeds results in higher levels of morphine and codeine in the blood. Cases at autopsy have reported levels of morphine and codeine in the blood as high as 800 ng/mL and 260 ng/mL, respectively (96900).\nDistribution\nIn humans, consuming poppy seed for 3 weeks results in hair morphine levels ranging from 0.05-0.48 ng/10 mg hair (27530). Morphine may also be found in saliva for up to one hour after poppy seed ingestion (27531). Poppy seed ingestion may induce positive test results for opiates in sweat 6.5 hours after consumption (27525).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, poppy seed ingestion results in morphine glucuronides in the serum after 6 hours, with trace levels of free morphine (27525).\nExcretion\nMorphine and codeine are excreted in the urine following poppy seed ingestion. Urinary levels appear to be highest 3-8 hours after ingestion, with some urinary values exceeding 300 ng/mL (27252, 27253). Morphine may be detected in the urine for up to 35 hours (27526). Thebaine has been detected in the urine in some, but not all, studies (27265, 27266). Noscapine and papaverine have not been detected (27525).",

Therefore, levels of morphine, codeine, oripavine, and thebaine in poppy seed samples can be undetectable during analysis or as high as 240 mg/kg, 348 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 106 mg/kg, respectively (27258, 27259, 27263, 27291, 27292, 27294, 27526, 27527, 27529, 27533) (96900, 96901, 96912, 104521).\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority estimates that the average combined dose of opiates from typical consumption of poppy seeds often exceeds 10 mcg/kg of morphine equivalents, the lowest known therapeutic oral dose (104521). However, the amount of opiates present on poppy seeds varies widely based on plant genetics and environmental/cultivation factors. Exposure to opium alkaloids in foods containing poppy seeds can also be reduced by washing, grinding, and/or baking the seeds before use, or using ready-to-eat poppy seed products that have already been processed (96912, 104521).\nAnticancer effects\nIn mice, administering poppy seed orally for 2 weeks, then administering along with benzo[a]pyrene(B[a]P) for an additional 8 weeks, reduces the development of squamous cell carcinoma in the stomach by 62% (27290)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of poria mushroom is the sclerotium, which is a spore of the fungus, consisting of a dense mass of filaments containing food reserves (93767). Constituents include triterpenoids, polysaccharides, steroids, amino acids, choline, histidine, and potassium (93767, 93768, 93769, 104504). The triterpenoids include 6-alpha-hydroxypolyporenic acid C, dehydrotumulosic acid, poricoic acid A, polyporenic acid C, 3-epidehydrotumulosic acid, dehydropachymic acid, pachymic acid, dehydrotrametenolic acid, dehydroeburicoic acid, eburicoic acid, and poriacosones (93769, 104504, 111908, 111918).\nAnti-cancer effects\nTriterpene constituents of poria mushroom have antitumor effects in vitro (3729, 93769, 111908). These triterpenes possibly induce apoptosis or prevent signaling within the cancer cell (93769). Other research suggests that triterpenes and polysaccharides from poria mushroom might have chemopreventive effects, possibly by inhibiting angiogenesis (93768, 93769), as well as the adhesion and movement of cancer cells (111908).\nAnti-emetic effects\nTriterpene constituents of poria mushroom may have anti-emetic effects (3730).\nAnti-hyperuricemic effects\nAn animal model of hyperuricemia suggests that oral poria mushroom extract may reduce serum uric acid levels partly due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity, a key enzyme in uric acid production (116173).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome evidence suggests poria mushroom extracts and isolated triterpene and polysaccharide constituents have anti-inflammatory activity (3728, 3729, 3736, 3737, 104505, 108314, 111918). Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, and phospholipase A2 has been reported, as well as inhibition of leukotriene B4, which might be useful for psoriasis (12615, 93769). In a rat model of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, poria polysaccharides reduced prostate inflammation and reduced levels of C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6. The polysaccharides also regulated production of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol, which reduced prostate swelling (104505, 108314). It is hypothesized that some anti-inflammatory effects may be related to modulation of the gut microbiota (108314) and/or suppressing gut leakiness and the absorption of inflammatory compounds (111915).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn a rat model of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, poria polysaccharides reduced oxidative stress by reducing levels of nitric oxide synthase (104505).\nBone effects\nIn a mouse model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, an alcoholic extract of poria mushroom inhibited formation and differentiation of osteoclasts, and inhibited bone resorptive activity, reducing trabecular bone loss (104504).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, poria mushroom polysaccharides seem to modulate the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota, and improve the function of tight junctions in the colon lining (108314, 111915, 111918, 111919). This might play a role in at least some of the proposed benefits of poria mushroom. In animal research, these benefits were associated with an improvement in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (111919).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPoria mushroom and its constituents have anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory research (3728, 3729, 3736, 3737, 104505, 108314). Therefore, it is of interest for the prevention and treatment of liver metabolic disorders, including metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). In an animal model of dietary fat-induced MAFLD, poria mushroom triterpenoid extract was found to reduce the liver accumulation of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and inflammatory cells, thereby reducing liver injury and blood levels of triglycerides (111914). The anti-inflammatory effect of poria mushroom may also play a role in the protection against alcoholic liver disease. In an animal alcoholic liver disease model, a poria mushroom polysaccharide reduces liver injury, possibly by reducing levels of inflammatory and oxidative compounds around and within the hepatocyte (111915).\nImmunologic effects\nClinical research suggests that poria mushroom polysaccharides can stimulate an immune response, including stimulation of cytokines (93769). This response is lessened in individuals who are dehydrated (93771). Other evidence suggests poria mushroom extracts might also have immunosuppressive effects (3726).\nNephroprotective effects\nPoria contains a glucan known as pachyman. It prevents urinary protein excretion and serum cholesterol elevation, and reduces the degree of histopathological changes in nephritic rats (3727, 93769). Also, in an animal model of fluid resuscitation-induced organ damage, poria mushroom reduced kidney injury and had beneficial effects on markers of kidney damage, including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. The mechanism of action was thought to be related to a decreased release of matrix metalloproteinases and protection against endothelial glycocalyx degradation and damage (108315).\nNeuroprotective effects\nPoria mushroom has been traditionally used for its anti-aging effects and is of interest for preventing cognitive decline with age. In an animal Alzheimer model, poria mushroom essential oil improves learning and memory, possibly by reducing the activity of acetylcholinesterase and preventing neurodegeneration (111917).\nSedative effects\nPoria mushroom has been traditionally used for its sedative effects. In both normal and insomnia animal models, poria mushroom extract reduces the time to fall asleep and increases sleep duration, possibly via stimulatory effects on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (111916). In an anxiety model, poria mushroom extract increases levels of serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Mechanisms of action seem to be related to alterations in the gut microbiota and/or reduced inflammation (111918)."

Oral potassium chloride and potassium citrate are FDA-approved prescription products (95010, 107989). Larger doses increase the risk of hyperkalemia (15)....when administered intravenously (IV) at appropriate infusion rates (95011). Parenteral potassium is an FDA-approved prescription product (15, 95011).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nHypokalemia. Oral or intravenous potassium can treat and prevent hypokalemia.\nAdministering potassium orally or intravenously is effective for treating and preventing hypokalemia (15, 107970). Oral potassium 20 mEq (780 mg of elemental potassium) is typically taken once daily to prevent hypokalemia (15, 95010). Oral potassium 40-100 mEq (1560-3900 mg of elemental potassium) is typically taken in 2-5 divided doses daily to treat hypokalemia (95010). Doses should be limited to 40 mEq (1560 mg of elemental potassium), and the total dose should not exceed 200 mEq (7800 mg of elemental potassium) in 24 hours (95010). Potassium supplementation and route of administration should be individualized based on serum potassium level and patient status (15, 107970).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Oral potassium, via dietary intake or supplementation, reduces blood pressure.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary potassium consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension (1310, 8817, 69512). Additionally, most clinical research shows that potassium, taken orally as part of the diet or as a supplement, reduces systolic blood pressure by about 3-9.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 2-6.4 mmHg in patients with or without hypertension (3385, 92104, 92106, 95624, 107974, 115728). In most of these studies, daily intake of potassium typically ranged from about 1500-7800 mg, with the most common intake being about 2340-2540 mg daily (92104, 95624). However, some research shows that taking potassium does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure (69541, 69550, 107966). Differences in the patient populations, potassium intake, and salt intake could have contributed to the conflicting results. Potassium seems to be more effective for people with hypertension, low potassium levels, high daily sodium intake, and for Black adults (3384, 3385, 3386, 92104, 92106). Some research also shows that the greatest blood pressure-lowering effects of potassium occur at doses of about 3900-7800 mg daily (95624). A meta-analysis of clinical trials using a novel computational technique to assess both potassium intake and excretion suggests that the optimal blood pressure reduction occurs when taking about 1500 mg supplemental potassium daily or an overall intake of 4500-6500 mg potassium daily (105448). This analysis is limited by the heterogeneity and short duration of the included trials. There is also interest in utilizing low-sodium, high-potassium food substitutes to treat hypertension. Research shows that using salt substitutes containing 25% to 30% potassium chloride reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3-4.6 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, when compared with regular table salt (107971, 107976).\n\nIn 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published guidelines recommending that patients with hypertension consume 3500-5000 mg of potassium daily (95680). This intake of potassium is expected to lower systolic blood pressure by about 4-5 mmHg in patients with hypertension and by about 2 mmHg in normotensive patients (3385). Although potassium supplements and dietary potassium both seem to be beneficial, the guidelines recommend getting potassium from dietary sources, since potassium-rich diets are usually heart-healthy (95680). Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that foods containing at least 350 mg potassium and that are low in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol can state that \"diets containing foods that are good sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke\" (1310, 8817).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral prescription potassium citrate reduces the risk of kidney stone recurrence. It is unclear if non-prescription potassium citrate would be beneficial.\nThe American Urological Association (AUA) recommends potassium citrate therapy for patients with recurrent calcium stones and low urinary citrate, those with recurrent calcium or calcium oxalate stones without current metabolic abnormalities, and those with uric acid or cystine stones. The citrate component reduces urine calcium excretion and increases urine citrate and urine pH, which in turn alleviates crystal growth, formation, and aggregation. Sodium citrate may also be used to prevent stone recurrence; however, due to sodium's propensity to increase urine calcium excretion, potassium citrate remains the preferred salt formulation (107972).\n\nIt is important to note that potassium citrate supplements are not equivalent to prescription potassium citrate products. Dose and duration of treatment is determined by a healthcare professional and individualized based on a patient's urinary citrate levels (107975, 107989). Serum potassium levels should be monitored prior to starting potassium citrate, within 2 weeks of treatment initiation, and every 12 months (107975).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Eating foods high in potassium and low in sodium might reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear if taking potassium supplements has the same benefit.\nLarge population studies in adults without prior CVD have found that higher dietary potassium intake is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (109395, 109399). One study found that daily potassium intake of about 3300 mg is associated with a 13% reduction in CVD risk when compared with intake of about 1920 mg (109399). The other study found that each additional 1000 mg of daily urinary potassium excretion, which is a marker of dietary intake, is associated with an 18% reduction in CVD risk (109395). Another observational study in over 15,000 adults with history of stroke or hypertension shows that replacing regular table salt with a substitute product containing 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride for an average of 5 years decreases the rate of stroke, major cardiovascular events, or death (107976). High quality clinical trials are needed to confirm this association.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that foods containing at least 350 mg potassium and that are low in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol can state that \"diets containing foods that are good sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke\" (1310, 8817).\nless\nStroke. Eating foods high in potassium and low in sodium might reduce the risk of stroke. It is unclear if taking potassium supplements has the same benefit.\nHigher dietary intake of potassium seems to be associated with a lower risk of stroke. Population research has found that increasing dietary potassium intake by 1-1.5 grams daily is associated with up to a 20% reduced risk of stroke (92105, 92107). Some population research has found that higher supplemental intake of potassium is associated with a 29% reduced risk of ischemic stroke. However, supplemental potassium intake is not found to be associated with a lower risk of hemorrhagic or total stroke (92107). An observational study in over 15,000 adults with history of stroke or hypertension shows that replacing regular table salt with a substitute product containing 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride for an average of 5 years decreases the rate of stroke, major cardiovascular events, or death (107976). High quality clinical trials are needed to confirm this association.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that foods containing at least 350 mg potassium and that are low in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol can state that \"diets containing foods that are good sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke\" (1310, 8817).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if increasing dietary potassium helps prevent chronic kidney disease.\nA large population-based prospective study following over 300,000 participants without CKD for a median of 11.9 years. suggests that higher urinary potassium excretion (a marker of dietary potassium intake) is associated with a lower risk of developing CKD. Compared to the lowest quartile of urinary potassium-to-creatinine ratio, those in the highest quartile had a 20% lower relative risk of incident CKD. Similar results were found when analyzing dietary potassium intake. The association between potassium and reduced CKD risk was consistent across most subgroups analyzed, including sex, age, ethnicity, and other factors (116163).\nless\nDental hypersensitivity. It is unclear if topical potassium improves dental hypersensitivity.\nOne meta-analysis of clinical research shows that using a dentifrice containing 5% potassium nitrite reduces dentin sensitivity when compared with a dentifrice that does not contain potassium nitrite (69549). Other clinical research published in a systematic review shows that potassium-containing toothpastes might reduce dentin sensitivity more than controls that do not contain potassium. However, these toothpastes might be less effective than other active toothpastes, such as those containing sodium monofluorophosphate, and the effect may result from a placebo effect, since the mechanism of action of potassium is unclear (69456).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if increasing dietary potassium reduces the risk of diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 7 large population studies has found that consuming dietary potassium 3300-3500 mg daily is associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of diabetes when compared with consumption below 1000 mg daily. Results were similar when studies that measured potassium intake with a dietary questionnaire were analyzed separately from those that measured intake based on urinary potassium excretion (110776). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Furthermore, despite use of data from various databases, most studies included in the analysis were conducted by the same author.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral potassium improves glycemic control in prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in Black patients with prediabetes shows that taking extended-release potassium (Klor-Con M10, Cardinal Health) 40 mEq daily as potassium chloride for 3 months does not improve glucose tolerance when compared with placebo. Although fasting glucose levels were slightly reduced in the potassium group when compared with placebo, both groups experienced a worsening of glucose intolerance, with no change in insulin levels or glycated hemoglobin (98533).\nless\nMortality. It is unclear if increasing dietary potassium is beneficial for mortality outcomes.\nA large prospective cohort study over 15.5 years suggests that higher potassium intake is associated with reduced mortality risk, with stronger protective effects in females. Specifically, females in the highest quintile of potassium intake have an 18% lower risk of overall mortality and 21% lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to those in the lowest quintile. Males showed a 4% reduction in overall mortality and no significant association with cardiovascular disease mortality. The study also found that a higher sodium-potassium ratio was associated with increased mortality risk, particularly in females (114992).\n\nA large observational cohort study using NHANES data of 14,000 participants found a non-linear relationship between potassium intake and all-cause mortality. The analysis identified a negative correlation between potassium intake and all-cause mortality, up to an intake of 3500 mg per day. However, when potassium intake exceeded 3,500 mg per day, there was no significant association with mortality (114995).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there is interest in using oral potassium for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of potassium for this condition.\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral potassium improves physical performance in older adults.\nObservational research in older adults has found that decreased dietary potassium intake and increased dietary sodium intake over 5 years is associated with worsened physical performance (105450).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral potassium is beneficial in patients with SLE.\nObservational research in patients with SLE has found that increased dietary potassium intake is not associated with improvements in disease activity scores or markers of cardiovascular disease, including lipid levels and blood pressure, when compared with low dietary potassium intake. However, higher potassium intake does seem to reduce the odds of having elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, in these patients (109397).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate potassium for these uses.",

            "Nutrient Depletions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBETA-2 AGONISTS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nBeta-2 agonists can reduce serum levels of potassium.\nBinding of agonists to beta-2 receptors stimulates adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic-AMP and activating membrane Na/K-ATPase pumps. This increases cellular potassium uptake which may cause hypokalemia (8880, 8886). This can occur with oral, parenteral, or inhaled beta-2 agonists, especially during acute use of high doses (6217, 7001, 8880, 8881, 8882, 8883, 8884, 8885, 8886, 8889, 8890, 9534, 9599). In high-risk patients, such as those with heart disease or taking other potassium-lowering medications, beta-2 agonist-induced hypokalemia might also lead to ventricular ectopy, prolonged QT intervals, and arrhythmias (7001, 8880, 8882, 8883, 8890, 8891, 9534, 9599). Continued use of the beta-2 agonist results in a reduction of the hypokalemic effect over time (8880, 8882, 8883, 8886, 8890, 8891). Monitor serum potassium levels in people receiving acute high dose beta-2 agonists and in those with other risk factors for hypokalemia; potassium supplements may be necessary if symptomatic hypokalemia develops (8880). For information on foods that are rich in potassium, see our chart.\nless\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCorticosteroids can increase urinary potassium excretion.\nMineralocorticoids and some glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) cause sodium retention, resulting in compensatory renal potassium excretion and hypokalemia. This effect is dose-related and depends on mineralocorticoid potency (4425). Monitor serum potassium regularly. If levels become low, change to a glucocorticoid with less mineralocorticoid activity, or give potassium supplements. For information on foods that are rich in potassium, see our chart.\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nSome diuretic drugs increase urinary potassium excretion.\nLoop and thiazide diuretics increase the risk of hypokalemia due to increased urinary potassium excretion. However, potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone, can counteract the potassium losses seen with loop diuretics and thiazides. Monitor serum potassium levels and give potassium supplements when necessary (4412, 4425, 4449). For information on foods that are rich in potassium, see our chart.\nless\nLEVODOPA\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nLevodopa can increase potassium excretion, but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant.\nIncreased urinary potassium losses occur in some people treated with levodopa. The mechanism isn't clear, but the effect doesn't occur when a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, is used with levodopa (as in Sinemet) (7201). This interaction is therefore unlikely to be clinically significant.\nless\nMETHYLXANTHINES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nMethylxanthines can decrease serum levels of potassium.\nMethylxanthines like theophylline can reduce serum potassium levels, possibly by increasing intracellular uptake of potassium. Hypokalemia is most likely to occur after acute overdose of these drugs (17). However, reduced potassium levels can occur with therapeutic doses, and the incidence and degree of hypokalemia increases with increasing serum theophylline levels (9534, 9537, 9538, 9539). Monitor potassium levels in people with other risk factors for hypokalemia. For information on foods that are rich in potassium, see our chart.\nless\nPENICILLINS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPenicillins can increase urinary potassium excretion.\nPenicillins, which are formulated as sodium salts, present a large sodium load to the kidneys. Increased amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, and the penicillin moiety acts as a non-reabsorbable anion, promoting urinary potassium excretion (9519). Monitor serum potassium levels and give potassium supplements, or switch to an alternative antibiotic, as necessary. For information on foods that are rich in potassium, see our chart.\nless\nSODIUM PHOSPHATES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHigh doses of sodium phosphates can deplete potassium.\nUse of high doses (> 45 mL in 24 hours), such as those used for bowel cleansing before surgery, can lead to serious electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia. Avoid large doses, especially in the elderly and people with other risk factors for electrolyte disturbances (8877, 9531). Advise people to avoid using high doses of these products for self-treatment of constipation.\nless\nSTIMULANT LAXATIVES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nStimulant laxatives, when used long-term or in high doses, can lead to potassium depletion.\nLong-term use of stimulant laxatives, or acute use of high doses (e.g., in bowel-cleansing regimens), can result in potassium loss and hypokalemia. Advise people to only use stimulant laxatives short-term at recommended doses (4411, 4412, 4425).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nPotassium overdose can result in hyperkalemia. Symptoms can include paresthesia, weakness, paralysis, listlessness, vertigo, confusion, hypotension, blood in the stool, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, and death (15, 16, 3385, 95010, 95011).\nTreatment\nManagement of hyperkalemia is well-established; details can be found in various medical guidelines.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nTotal body potassium is regulated by the kidney. Distribution in intracellular and extracellular fluid has been shown to have a large effect on serum potassium level without a change in total body potassium (69690). The extracellular fluid has been found to contain only 2% of total potassium in the body.\n\nSkeletal muscle and the liver buffer changes in plasma potassium concentration via transcellular potassium redistribution and feedback control of renal potassium excretion. Other homeostatic responses activate when decreased potassium intake is sensed, even when plasma potassium concentration is still within the normal range. (69587).\n\nAn investigation of the effects of potassium in the dialysate in stable hemodialysis patients showed that the use of dialysate containing 0 or 2mEq/L of potassium concentration did not make a significant difference with regard to total body potassium concentration (69767).\nExcretion\nApproximately 80% of dietary potassium is recovered in the urine (92104).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPotassium is an element that is essential in physiological processes including nerve impulse transmission; cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle contraction; gastric secretion; renal function; tissue synthesis; and carbohydrate synthesis (15). Inadequate dietary intake of potassium might play a role in the development of hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. It is likely that potassium works together with other nutrients to produce beneficial physiological effects (1310, 8817).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nObservational research in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus has found that an intake of potassium above 3510 mg daily is associated with a lower odds of having high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) when compared with potassium intake below 3510 mg daily, suggesting that potassium may have some anti-inflammatory effects (109397).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using potassium to alter calcium and phosphate homeostasis and improve bone health. A post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial has found that taking potassium supplements is associated with a lower level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), decreased calcium excretion, and increased phosphate levels, but with no effect on parathyroid hormone or vitamin D levels. Theoretically, potassium supplements might increase markers of bone resorption and improve calcium and phosphate homeostasis (105449).\nCardiovascular effects\nA restriction in sodium intake that is accompanied by increased intake of potassium has been recommended to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease (69591, 92104). High plasma sodium levels stiffen endothelial cells and block nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, while high plasma potassium levels soften endothelial cells and activate NO release. Additionally, sodium and potassium pumps are necessary for maintaining both water and electrolyte balance. Potassium may need to be increased in situations with high sodium intake, in order to counteract the effects of high sodium, such as increased volume, which can lead to hypertension (92106).\n\nPotassium may also protect against the effects of high sodium. A small clinical study in young healthy adults shows that following a diet high in potassium (300 mEq daily) and high in sodium (300 mEq daily) for 7 days is associated with a greater increase in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation when compared with following a diet with the same sodium content but with less potassium (120 mEq daily) (105451).\n\nPotassium supplementation has also been found to increase levels of aldosterone, a hormone associated with increases in blood pressure. A very small, clinical crossover study in healthy, normotensive males shows that taking 90 mEq of potassium daily for 4 weeks increases plasma aldosterone and renin concentrations, and may potentiate angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion, but has no effect on cardiovascular responses during an angiotensin II infusion, when compared with placebo (107967).\n\nFinally, a meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that supplemental potassium intake is associated with improved endothelial function, as shown by increased flow-mediated dilation (116883).\nImmune effects\nObservational research in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus has found that increased dietary intake of potassium is associated with lower levels of complement C3, with no influence on levels of complement C4, when compared with low dietary potassium intake. Complement C3 and C4 are markers of autoimmune disease (109397).\nRenal Effects\nPotassium citrate is recommended by the American Urological Association (AUA) for patients with recurrent calcium stones and low urinary citrate, those with recurrent calcium or calcium oxalate stones without current metabolic abnormalities, and those with uric acid or cystine stones. Citrate reduces urine calcium excretion and increases urine citrate and urine pH, which in turn alleviates crystal growth, formation, and aggregation. Sodium citrate may also be used to prevent stone recurrence; however, due to sodium's propensity to increase urine calcium excretion, potassium citrate remains the preferred salt formulation (107972).\n\nClinical research has compared potassium citrate 20 mEq twice daily to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg twice daily for 6 months in patients with documented calcium oxalate kidney stones and hypercalciuria at baseline. When compared with baseline, both treatments reduced 24-hour urine calcium levels at month 3, and when compared with HCTZ, potassium citrate increased 24-hour urine citrate levels and urine pH. At a 12-month follow-up, stone recurrence was detected in 1 and 2 patients in the potassium citrate and HCTZ groups, respectively (107973)."

Levels of glycoalkaloids can increase post-harvest due to improper storage at higher temperatures, lower humidity, or areas with light. Also, mechanical damage or exposure to gamma-radiation or fungi increases these levels. Glycoalkaloids are concentrated in the peel; although when levels are high they also increase in the flesh of the tuber. Peeling will remove about 30% of the glycoalkaloids (97758).\nless",

While one preliminary clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming cooked purple potato 200 grams daily for 14 days can improve arterial stiffness, a marker of CVD, potato consumption does not seem to improve other CVD risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid levels, or markers of inflammation, when compared to baseline (103262). Additionally, epidemiological evidence shows that higher intake of boiled or fried potatoe does not increase or reduce the risk of CVD, hypertension, or elevated triglycerides (97751, 111210).\nDyspepsia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with dyspepsia shows that taking freshly squeezed potato juice 200-300 mL twice daily for one week improves gastrointestinal symptoms by 42% to 51% when compared with baseline (97757). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nHypertension. While a meta-analysis of 4 observational studies shows that potato consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of hypertension (103261), some preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that eating 6-8 small purple potatoes twice daily for 4 weeks reduces diastolic blood pressure by 4% when compared with baseline. Systolic blood pressure reductions are not statistically significant (97752). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Preliminary clinical research in people with pre-hypertension or mild hypertension shows that eating baked or boiled potatoes to provide potassium 85 mmol daily for 17 days lowers systolic blood pressure by 6 mmHg compared with a 2 mmHg decrease without potassium supplementation (107974).\nMore evidence is needed to rate potato for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, taking potato glycoalkaloids in solution or in mashed potatoes increases plasma levels of the glycoalkaloids alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine in a dose-dependent manner, with peaks occurring between 4-8 hours. Levels do not return to normal within the first 24 hours (97758).\nExcretion\nIn human research, the half-life of alpha-chaconine ranged from 27-84 hours and the half-life of alpha-solanine ranged from 5-42 hours (97758).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the potato is the tuber. Potatoes are a source of vitamin C, iron, riboflavin, and potassium, and are rich in carbohydrates (6, 97752). They also contain polyphenols (97752). Potatoes also contain the glycoalkaloids alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine, which are glycosylated derivatives of solanidine. These glycoalkaloids are found in the tuber, as well as the leaves, sprouts, and flowers (97758). Purple potatoes also contain anthocyanins and caffeoyl polyamines (97752).\nAnti-microbial effects\nPotato is used topically to treat infections. A potato peel extract inhibits bacterial adhesion to host cells without killing the bacteria. This activity might be due to polyphenol oxidase, a compound known to have anti-adhesive properties (6107). Also, the glycoalkaloids in potato protect against fungi and other pests (97758).\nAppetite suppressant effects\nEating baked, mashed or fried potatoes 2 hours prior to a meal seems to reduce appetite and food intake at that meal similarly to eating an isocaloric quantity of white bread (111209). There is interest in using proteinase inhibitors found in potato to reduce hunger and energy intake; although effects appear to be mixed. Most research in humans suggests that taking a specific product (Satietrol or Slendesta) reduces hunger, appetite, and later energy intake (473, 6255, 97753, 97755). However, one study did not find any effects on appetite when the proteinase inhibitor was given in a pre-meal mini-drink (97753). The proposed mechanism of action of the proteinase inhibitor is increased effects of cholecystokinin (CCK), which produces satiety and has been shown to play a role in the short-term inhibition of food intake. The proteinase inhibitor blocks the effects of the enzymes chymotrypsin and trypsin, which break down CCK (476, 477, 6255, 97753, 97755). Taking potato extract containing known amounts of proteinase inhibitor has been shown to increase plasma levels of CCK in some, but not all, research (6255, 97753, 97755).\n\nPreliminary research with a specific potato fiber product (FiberBind, KMC), containing 68% primarily insoluble fiber, suggests that it increases satiety and feelings of fullness, leading to reduced food consumption at the next meal, when compared with a low-fiber control. It also lowers peak insulin levels and delays glucose absorption, but does not affect total energy intake or fecal fat excretion (111205).\nEffects on calcium homeostasis\nPreliminary research in people with pre-hypertension or mild hypertension shows that eating baked or boiled potatoes to provide potassium 85 mmol daily for 17 days does not change calcium retention, urinary calcium excretion, or urinary pH (111204).\nEffects on glucose homeostasis\nThe data on the effect of potato on glucose homeostasis are conflicting. A meta-analysis of 19 studies shows a positive association between dietary potato intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or gestational diabetes. Each single increase in the number of 80-gram servings of any form of potato per day increases the risk of T2DM by 10%, and the risk of gestational diabetes by 22%. The increased risk also depends on the cooking method, being 2% for baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, but 34% for fried potatoes. However, in the large Framingham Offspring Study, the level of dietary potato intake was not associated with the incidence of impaired fasting glucose or T2DM although, with higher levels of physical activity, consumption of fried potatoes was associated with a 24% lower risk of these outcomes (111210). In females living in China the risk of T2DM is reduced with increasing potato intake, possibly due to the majority of that intake being cold potato containing resistant starch, which has a lower glycemic index (111213). Preliminary research in healthy adults in Western countries shows that eating cooked then cooled potatoes is associated with lower fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels when compared with isoenergetic control foods without resistant starch (111207). Preliminary research in overweight patients with T2DM shows that eating cooked potatoes prior to a rice-based evening meal reduces the area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) for nocturnal glucose levels when compared with control. If the potatoes are boiled then cooled, postprandial peak insulin levels and insulin AUC levels are higher (111208).\nGastrointestinal effects\nUncooked potatoes or cooked and cooled potatoes contain resistant starch which is an indigestible carbohydrate and can be converted to short-chain fatty acids by gut bacteria. In healthy adults, consumption of purple potatoes, to provide 1.74 grams of resistant starch daily for 4 weeks, is associated with modest changes in the composition and diversity of gut bacteria, which were not seen with daily consumption of refined grain. However, neither intervention affected short-chain fatty acid levels in the gut (111212).\nStress-related effects\nA variety of potato with purple flesh (S. tuberosum L. cv. Shadow Queen) contains anthocyanins, including aglycones of petunidin and peonidin. Preliminary research in healthy older adults shows that eating this type of potato to provide 45 mg anthocyanins daily for 8 weeks reduces work-related stress, irritability and depression, when compared with eating a potato variety (Haruka) that is low in anthocyanins (111211)."

It is unclear if oral pregnenolone is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nThe effects of pregnenolone adjunctive therapy on negative symptoms of schizophrenia are conflicting. Several clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and suboptimal response to previous antipsychotic treatments show that taking pregnenolone 50 mg orally daily alone or as add-on therapy with L-theanine 400 mg daily, for 8 weeks, reduces negative symptoms based on the negative symptom scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) when compared with placebo (94029, 97923). However, conflicting results exist. One study shows that taking pregnenolone 30 mg or 200 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve negative symptoms based on the negative symptom scale of the PANSS in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (94028). Furthermore, another clinical study conducted in women hospitalized with an acute episode of schizophrenia shows that taking pregnenolone 50 mg orally daily for 8 weeks in combination with risperidone 2-6 mg daily does not reduce negative symptoms when compared with risperidone plus placebo (97924). Reasons for the conflicting results may relate to concomitant use of psychotropic medications such as mood stabilizers and antidepressants, prenenolone dosage, and schizophrenia subtypes of the included patients. Despite some conflicting results (94028), most research shows that taking pregnenolone orally as adjunctive therapy does not significantly improve positive symptoms based on the positive symptom subscale of the PANSS compared to placebo in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (94029, 94032, 97923, 97924).

In humans, oral administration of pregnenolone tripled serum levels of pregnenolone sulfate, and raised serum levels of allopregnanolone fivefold (94032).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPregnenolone is synthesized in the body from cholesterol and is a precursor for the steroid hormones, including progesterone, aldosterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and estrogens (3008). Allopregnanolone is a metabolite of pregnenolone (104274).\nAnalgesic effects\nLaboratory and animal research suggest that the analgesic effects of pregnenolone are from its metabolite, allopregnanolone, which has positive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-alpha receptor activity (104274).\nPsychiatric effects\nThere is interest in using pregnenolone for psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pregnenolone levels have been reported in people with affective disorders, particularly during episodes of active depression. Increasing pregnenolone levels may improve negative symptoms of these disorders (3005, 94032). Additionally, patients with autism have been shown to have decreased GABAA receptors in the brain (94026). NMDA receptor hypofunction may play a role in schizophrenia (94032). In bipolar depression, pregnenolone may act through the endocannabinoid (CB1) receptor to exert its antidepressant effects (94027). Pregnenolone and its metabolites can also modulate GABAA, NMDA, cholinergic, dopaminergic, sigma-1, and neurotrophic systems, thus affecting neuronal excitability, which may contribute to its ability to improve both negative and positive symptoms of certain psychiatric illnesses (94028, 94032). In schizophrenic patients, pregnenolone showed memory enhancing effects, possibly due to its action as an NMDA-agonist or its effects on cholinergic activity (94028). Pregnenolone and its metabolites, including allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, may increase the number of GABAA receptors in the brain. In vitro and animal research shows that allopregnanolone decreases apoptosis and has anti-inflammatory effects, which may further contribute to its effects in patients suffering from schizophrenia (94032). Another metabolite, pregnenolone sulfate (PS), stimulates the movement of NMDA receptors to the neuronal surface (94026). Pregnenolone and its metabolites have also been shown to be neuroprotective. They can regulate the growth of neurons and enhance myelination (94028, 94029). Finally, pregnenolone may also be able to block extra-pyramidal symptoms, possibly due to its ability to counter the dopaminergic-blocking effects of traditional antipsychotic medications (94028).\n\nThere is also interest in using pregnenolone for treating cannabis intoxication and addiction. Pregnenolone acts as a negative allosteric modulator. In rats, an injection of THC or a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist increased pregnenolone levels in various sections of the brain, via activation of the CB1 receptor. The increase in pregnenolone levels lead to a negative feed-back loop on the CB1 receptor. The negative feedback blocked behavioral and some somatic effects of THC. Additionally, treatment with pregnenolone blocked THC induced increases in dopamine levels. Pregnenolone administered prior to a CB1 agonist lead to decreased motivation for THC. These effects were not seen with allopregnanolone (94030).\n\nPregnenolone has antagonist activity at GABA-A receptors in the brain and induces changes in the sleep EEG by increasing the time spent in slow wave sleep (3007)."

Cases of low colonic obstruction and rectal phytobezoars resulting in rectal perforation have been reported for patients who ingested prickly pear cactus fruit seeds (65260, 65266). However, these events are extremely rare and attributed to the ingestion of a large number of fruits.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption And Metabolism: In human research, a single dose of 500 grams of prickly pear cactus fruit pulp resulted in a maximum plasma concentration of indicaxanthin and betanin, constituents of prickly pear cactus, at 3 hours, followed by a decline per first-order kinetics and a lack of either compound in plasma by 12 hours after intake (65328).\nExcretion\nIn human research, betanin, a component of prickly pear cactus, was undetected after 8 hours, and indicaxanthin was cleared by 12 hours following a single dose of 500 grams of cactus pear fruit pulp containing 28 mg of betanin and 16 mg of indicaxanthin. Half-lives of betanin and indicaxanthin were 0.94 and 2.36 hours, respectively (65328).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of prickly pear cactus are the pads, flowers, seeds, and fruit. Prickly pear cactus is often consumed as part of the diet. Ingesting 500 grams of prickly pear cactus provides 14.3 grams carbohydrate, 8.25 grams protein, 1.05 grams lipids, 18.85 grams cellulose (fibrous polysaccharide), 455.75 grams water, and 99.75 kilocalories (7028). The pads also contain numerous phenolic compounds including isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, piscidic acid, and eucomic acid (100636). The fruits of prickly pear cactus contain fiber, minerals, proteins, and kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin, along with their glycosides (100634).\nAnti-allergy effects\nAnimal research shows that a glycoprotein isolated from prickly pear cactus inhibits histamine, beta-hexosaminidase release, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in mouse serum (65299). It also suppresses the expression of antiallergic proteins (iNOS and COX-2).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPrickly pear cactus is thought to reduce symptoms of alcohol-induced hangovers by decreasing inflammation. Alcohol-induced hangovers are associated with an inflammatory response. People with an alcohol-induced hangover have increased levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and cortisol. People who take a specific prickly pear cactus extract seem to have lower CRP and cortisol levels, suggesting that prickly pear cactus might have anti-inflammatory effects (12085).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research shows that prickly pear cactus extracts have activity against Vibrio cholera (65306).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPrickly pear cactus can lower blood glucose and lipid levels, especially postprandially (14807, 65322, 65326, 92147). This effect is often attributed to its high fibrous polysaccharide content, including pectin (65263). Fiber can slow carbohydrate absorption from the gut. However, some researchers suspect prickly pear might also have an insulin sensitizing effect (7028, 92146).\nAntioxidant effects\nPrickly pear cactus has antioxidant effects. Consuming prickly pear cactus fruit pulp for 2 weeks seems to decrease pro-oxidants, decrease oxidation of lipids, and improve antioxidant status. This may be due to the vitamin C and plant pigments betanin and indicaxanthin contained in prickly pear cactus (12086). An ethanol extract of prickly pear cactus pads given by intraperitoneal injection to rats decreases intestinal oxidative damage caused by methotrexate. Markers of lipid and protein oxidation are reduced, mucosal destruction is decreased, and the structure of the intestinal epithelium is preserved (100635).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research shows that an extract of prickly pear cactus inhibits DNA and RNA intracellular virus replication and inactivates extracellular viruses including influenza, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (5956). The active inhibitory component(s) of the extract appear to reside in the cell walls of the plant. Also, ethanol extracts containing pheophorbide A and pyropheophorbide A from the pads of prickly pear cactus show significant antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and influenza A virus (IFV-A), but not polio virus type 1 (PV-1) (65311).\nDrug metabolism effects\nThe effect of prickly pear cactus extracts on the activity of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes seems to depend on the type of extract used and the testing environment. In rats, oral administration of an extract induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1 and 3A1 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B1. A hydrolyzed prickly pear cactus extract, in which glycosides are converted to aglycones, induces CYP2B6 and 3A4 in a hepatocarcinoma cell line, but inhibits CYP1A2, 3A1, and 3A4 in human and rat liver microsomes. The non-hydrolyzed extracts do not affect enzyme activity in the human and rat liver microsome preparations (100634). The effect of prickly pear cactus on human hepatic enzymes in humans is unknown.\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that the juice of prickly pear cactus fruit may protect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity, possibly due to the flavonoid, vitamin C, or betalain constituents (65285).\nLipid effects\nPrickly pear cactus can lower lipid levels (65274). This effect is often attributed to the high fibrous polysaccharide content, including pectin (65263). Fiber can decrease lipid absorption from the gut. There is also some evidence that the pectin component of prickly pear cactus can alter the liver metabolism of cholesterol and affect cholesterol levels (65274). Prickly pear cactus fruit also seems to improve platelet function in people with familial hypercholesterolemia, which may prevent initiation and progression of atherosclerosis (12391). Mucilage obtained from prickly pear cactus pads has a high content of soluble fiber and lowers triglyceride levels in rats (100637).\nNeurologic effects\nIndicaxanthin is a phytochemical of interest that is found in the yellow fruit of prickly pear cactus. A very small clinical study in healthy males aged 20-45 shows that taking the yellow fruit of prickly pear cactus 400 grams once may have effects on brain activity and pathways when compared with control (i.e., white fruit) (112180)."

Some progesterone products are available as prescription medications; these and other progesterone products used within commonly prescribed dosages are not within the scope of this topic.",
            "Warnings": "The term \"progestin\" is a general term for a substance that causes some or all of the biologic effects of progesterone. It is sometimes used to specifically refer to synthetic derivatives of progesterone in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (8143).\n\nThe terms \"bioidentical progesterone\" or \"natural progesterone\" refer to the form of progesterone that has the same chemical and molecular structure as endogenous progesterone produced in the body. This form of progesterone is available in both prescription and non-prescription products for oral or topical use. Clinical evidence related to non-prescription products is limited, and non-standardized testing of blood or salivary levels is often used as a basis for dosing (108146, 108147).\n\nPlant steroids, such as diosgenin and stigmasterol from wild yam or soy, are used as sources of bioidentical or natural progesterone. These steroids are converted to progesterone in the laboratory; the human body is unable to transform plant steroids into progesterone, and actual levels of progesterone in any plant are extremely low (108146). The USP designation (i.e., Progesterone USP) indicates progesterone synthesized from plant sources (108147).\n\nSome research shows that there are large variations in progesterone concentrations in non-prescription progesterone products, including variability between different compounding pharmacies and within batches from the same compounding pharmacy (108146, 112977).",

Both prescription and non-prescription products can contain progesterone in this form. This progesterone is synthesized from diosgenin, isolated from wild yam or soy. In the laboratory, this constituent is converted to pregnenolone and then to progesterone. The human body is not capable of synthesizing progesterone from diosgenin in vivo (8143, 108146).\nBenzodiazepine withdrawal effects\nProgesterone is thought to be beneficial for preventing benzodiazepine withdrawal because metabolites of progesterone have been found to have sedative-hypnotic properties (1221).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn human research, progesterone has beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilator responsiveness and markers of inflammation, hemostasis, and fibrinolysis inhibition, suggesting a possible protective effect for atherosclerosis (8145).\nEndometrial effects\nThe normal physiological effects of progesterone involves the transformation of a proliferative endometrium into a secreting endometrium. This effect is beneficial in preventing and treating endometrial hyperplasia (15).\nFertility effects\nProgesterone may also be beneficial in infertility because progesterone is necessary for implantation of the fertilized ovum and for maintaining pregnancy (15).\nHormonal effects\nProgesterone induces growth of mammary tissue and uterine smooth muscle relaxation (15).\nNeurological effects\nFemale patients with traumatic brain injury may have a better outcome than male patients. Progesterone is thought to play a role (70001). Progesterone has been suggested to have neuroprotective properties and protective effects against brain damage. This is possibly related to anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidant effects as shown in animal models (69891, 93748). Laboratory research suggests that progesterone might promote the myelination of axon dorsal root ganglia cultures (69849). In females, a single progesterone administration increased amygdala reactivity, possibly affecting mood (69906). Progesterone also appears to regulate Schwann cell proliferation and maintain myelin (69905).\nPremenstrual effects\nIn premenstrual syndrome (PMS), progesterone has been proposed as a therapy because the symptoms of PMS are thought to correlate with physiological fluctuations in endogenous progesterone (1220, 69978). The effects of progesterone on PMS do not appear to be regulated by peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (69814). In a patient with PMS, progesterone 300 mg orally resulted in increased brain alpha activity, and slight decreases in beta, delta, and theta activity (70015)."

Preliminary clinical research in adults with tibial shaft fractures shows that taking ascorbic acid 1500 mg, lysine 1010 mg, proline 560 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg does not reduce the mean fracture healing time when compared with placebo (102567).\nOsteopenia. Population research suggests that the highest habitual intake of proline is not associated with a reduced risk of osteopenia when compared with the lowest intake. However, it is associated with increased bone mineral density of the spine (102561).\nOsteoporosis. Population research suggests that the highest habitual intake of proline is not associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis when compared with the lowest intake. However, it is associated with increased bone mineral density of the spine (102561).\nWound healing.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, plasma proline levels increase in the blood within 10 minutes, increasing by 13-fold within 30 minutes. However, peak concentrations are reduced when proline is consumed with glucose (102563).\nMetabolism\nProline is metabolized to various products including the amino acids arginine, glutamic acid, glutamine, and ornithine (102558, 102559, 102566). Pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is produced by proline oxidation, can be recycled to produce proline, or converted to glutamate or ornithine (102558). Metabolism can take place in the blood, as well as within the cells lining the small intestine (102559). During the breakdown of collagen, dipeptides containing proline are released. The enzyme prolidase releases the individual amino acids and proline is re-used to make more collagen (102559).\nExcretion\nProline can be excreted in the urine (102560).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nProline is an amino acid used in the synthesis of proteins. It is the only secondary amino acid, or imino acid, in proteins. Proline, and its hydroxylated metabolite hydroxyproline, make up about 25% of the amino acids in collagen in bone, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix. The cyclic structure of proline provides physical stability to helical proteins like collagen (102558, 102559).\nAnticancer effects\nMetabolic stress results in the degradation of collagen by matrix metalloproteinases. The released proline is metabolized by proline oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in cell signaling. These ROS initiate downstream effects such as blocking the cell cycle, autophagy, and apoptosis. Tumors typically contain reduced levels of proline oxidase, suggesting that proline and proline oxidase play a role in tumor suppression (102558).\nBone effects\nProline is of interest for increasing bone mineral density. In vitro, proline stimulates insulin secretion. This plays a role in osteoblast growth and differentiation (102561).\nCell metabolism effects\nExtracellular proline is involved in nerve transmission at the synapse. Intracellular proline exhibits antioxidant effects and participates in the regulation of cell differentiation (102566). In skin fibroblasts in vitro, proline induced the expression of proteins involved in cellular signaling, including p53 and the transcription factor HIF-1a (102565).\nDermatological effects\nProline is of interest for reducing wrinkles associated with aging. Proline, and its hydroxylated metabolite hydroxyproline, make up about 25% of the amino acids in collagen, providing physical stability (102558, 102559). In skin fibroblasts in vitro, free proline stimulates the production of type I collagen (102565). Although proline has not been shown to improve skin wrinkles in clinical research, the topical application of a proline derivative, 1-carbamimidoyl-L-proline, has been shown to improve small lines around the eyes in middle-aged women by improving skin elasticity (102564).\nFertility effects\nIn vitro research related to storage of sperm for in-vitro fertilization procedures, shows that adding proline 2 mmol/L to a sperm growth medium preserves the motility, viability, and morphology of sperm, preserves DNA and chromatin integrity, and increases the total antioxidant capacity of semen, when compared with unsupplemented medium, or medium supplemented with proline 1 mmol/L or 4 mmol/L. Proline binds with phospholipid bilayers to stabilize sperm plasma membrane structure and function. It also forms a coating over the sperm surface by electrostatic interaction with the phosphate group of plasma membrane phospholipids, protecting sperm cells from free radical-induced damage (112768).\nGlucose regulating effects\nEating protein with carbohydrates at meals attenuates postprandial increases in blood glucose levels. In human research, taking proline with glucose reduced the maximal glucose level by about 23% when compared with taking glucose alone. However, proline had no effect on glucose levels when oral glucose was not provided (102563).\nProline metabolism defect effects\nDuring the breakdown of collagen, proline dipeptides are released. The enzyme prolidase breaks down proline-containing dipeptides to allow for the re-use of proline. In some patients, an inborn autosomal recessive genetic error causes prolidase deficiency. This increases urinary excretion of the dipeptides and results in the lack of available proline for re-use in collagen production. These individuals may require more dietary proline. Also, topical application of proline might be helpful for collagen production during wound and skin ulcer healing in these patients, as shown in case reports (102558, 102559, 102565, 102568, 102569)."

Oral propionyl-L-carnitine may improve myocardial ischemia and exercise capacity in patients with chronic, stable angina.\nIn patients with chronic, stable angina, taking propionyl-L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily orally for 4-6 weeks seems to produce small improvements in myocardial ischemia and exercise capacity (1579, 1580, 1581). In one study, exercise duration was increased by 5% when compared with placebo. However, angina attacks were not affected (1580). In another study, the number of angina attacks was reduced by approximately 67% when compared with placebo, although there was no change in nitroglycerin use (1581).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Intravenous propionyl-L-carnitine may improve left ventricular function and decrease myocardial ischemia.\nIn patients with chronic myocardial ischemia, intravenous administration of single doses of propionyl-L-carnitine 15 mg/kg may improve left ventricular function and cardiac output, as well as decrease myocardial ischemia (1571, 1572, 1573). In one study, left ventricular fraction increased by 18% when compared with placebo (1573).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral propionyl-L-carnitine may improve left ventricular function and exercise capacity in patients with class II or III CHF.\nIn patients with class II or III CHF, taking propionyl-L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily for up to 6 months seems to improve left ventricular function and exercise capacity (1575, 1582, 1583). Some research has found that exercise time increases by up to approximately 26% (1575, 1583) or by an additional minute when compared with placebo (1582). Also, ejection fraction is improved by 13% when compared with placebo (1583).\nless\nIntermittent claudication. Oral and intravenous propionyl-L-carnitine may improve walking capacity and quality of life in some patients with intermittent claudication and peripheral vascular disease.\nA meta-analysis, as well as individual clinical trials, suggest that taking oral propionyl-L-carnitine 1-4 grams daily in divided doses increases walking distance by up to 45 meters when compared with placebo (1434, 1435, 1436, 1576, 10456, 94439, 94446). One study suggests an increase in walking time of 1.33 minutes (94446). Taking propionyl-L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily over 6 months also seems to improve quality of life when compared with placebo. Oral propionyl-L-carnitine might be more effective in individuals with the ability to walk shorter distances, specifically less than 250 meters, at baseline (1436). One small clinical study failed to show a benefit when propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily was added to exercise; however, it may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups (94443).\n\nIntravenous propionyl-L-carnitine also increases claudication distance and maximal walking distance when given as a single dose of 600 mg or daily doses of 600 mg for 4 days. Maximal walking distance increases by 28% to 42% when compared with placebo (1437).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral propionyl-L-carnitine may improve clinical response and remission rates in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.\nIn patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis receiving conventional therapy, clinical research shows that taking colonic-release propionyl-L-carnitine tablets 0.5-1 gram twice daily for 4 weeks improves clinical response and remission rates (94447, 94448, 94449). Clinical response and clinical remission occur in 55% to 72% of patients treated with propionyl-L-carnitine when compared with baseline or placebo (94447, 94448). In one study, propionyl-L-carnitine increases the rate of clinical response by 44% when compared with placebo. However, a significant difference in remission rate when compared with placebo was lacking (94448).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. Oral propionyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in older males shows that taking propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams, in combination with acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams, daily for 6 months seems to attenuate symptoms of androgen decline. The combination appears to be similar to testosterone for improving sexual dysfunction, depression, and fatigue (12353). It is unclear if these findings are due to propionyl-L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, or the combination.\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. Topical propionyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in males and females with androgenic alopecia shows that applying 1 mL of a combination lotion (TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Uomo/Donna, Fidia Farmaceutici s.p.a.) containing undisclosed quantities of propionyl-L-carnitine, gamma-linolenic acid, and S-equol to the scalp daily for 6 months increases total hair count and the proportion of actively growing hair to senescent hair, but not hair diameter, when compared with baseline (100348). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to propionyl-L-carnitine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral glycine propionyl-L-carnitine is beneficial for improving athletic performance in young resistance-trained males; the available research is mixed. Details: Some clinical research shows that taking a specific ingredient called glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GlycoCarn, Sigma Ta Health Sciences, S.p.A.) 4.5 grams as a single dose 90 minutes before testing improves peak anaerobic power by 4% to 16% in repeated cycling sprints when compared with placebo (94444). However, taking 1.5, 3, or 4.5 grams of this product daily for 28 days does not improve anaerobic performance of repeated high speed high intensity bouts when compared with placebo. Additionally, preliminary research shows that taking 3 grams or 4.5 grams daily might actually be detrimental to performance. However, the study size was too small for definitive conclusions (94445). The reason for the discrepancy between studies is not clear. However, it is possible that a single dose prior to exercise is more effective than repeated dosing.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral propionyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CFS.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with CFS shows that taking propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months improves general fatigue in up to 63% of patients when compared with baseline. The combination of propionyl-L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine appears to be less effective than either supplement alone, with only 37% of patients taking this combination achieving improvement when compared with baseline (11788).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral propionyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease receiving conventional therapy shows that taking colonic-release propionyl-L-carnitine tablets 1 gram twice daily for 4 weeks results in clinical remission in 75% of patients (94447). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral propionyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn males with ED and diabetes, combination therapy with propionyl-L-carnitine and sildenafil may improve erectile function better than sildenafil alone. In males unresponsive to 8 uses of sildenafil, adding propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily to continued twice weekly doses of sildenafil 50 mg seems to improve erections and successful intercourse attempts more than sildenafil alone (12682). Also, preliminary clinical research in adults with ED shows that taking a specific combination of propionyl-L-carnitine 250 mg, niacin 20 mg, and arginine 2500 mg daily (Ezerex, Sigma-Tau) for 3 months substantially improves erections in 46% of patients and modestly improves sexual function in 37% of patients (94442). It is unclear if these findings are due to propionyl-L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPeyronie disease. Oral propionyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with advanced or resistant Peyronie disease shows that receiving the combination of oral propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily with injectable verapamil for 3 months improves erectile function by 42% compared with no change in a group receiving oral tamoxifen with injectable verapamil. The need for surgery was reduced from 27% in the tamoxifen group to 2% in the propionyl-L-carnitine group. Pain was reduced in 97% of all patients (12683).

Pivalate combines with carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (12759). Theoretically, losses of propionyl-L-carnitine could also be increased. Adefovir was formerly used for HIV infection at doses of 125-500 mg daily and was associated with significant dose- and duration-related decreases in blood carnitine. After 12 weeks of therapy with 125-250 mg daily, decreases of 42% to 62% were seen (15502), while 500 mg daily was associated with a 66% decrease in L-carnitine after 2 weeks (15503). Some studies used a supplement of L-carnitine 500 mg daily during adefovir therapy (15501, 15504). Adefovir is now used at a lower dose of 10 mg daily for treatment of hepatitis B.

Routine L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary.

Pivalate combines with L-carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (12759). Theoretically, losses of propionyl-L-carnitine could also be increased. Short courses of cefditoren can decrease blood concentrations of L-carnitine, but tissue levels are unlikely to be affected. Treatment for 1-2 months may cause a decrease in muscle L-carnitine, and treatment for 6 months or longer may cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency (12759).

Cisplatin might increase L-carnitine mobilization due to tissue injury and reduce renal tubular reabsorption due to kidney injury. Theoretically, cisplatin may also increase losses of propionyl-L-carnitine. Deficiency of carnitines is unlikely in people who can maintain adequate dietary intake (3642).\nless\nIFOSFAMIDE (Ifex)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking ifosfamide.\nIncreased urinary losses of L-carnitine can occur during ifosfamide therapy (3641). This might be due to binding of L-carnitine with a metabolite of ifosfamide (3641, 11558). Theoretically, ifosfamide may also increase losses of propionyl-L-carnitine. The clinical significance of this and the role of carnitine supplements in people treated with ifosfamide are unknown.\nless\nISOTRETINOIN (Accutane)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking isotretinoin.\nData on the effects of isotretinoin on carnitine levels are conflicting. Reduced carnitine blood levels have been reported, sometimes with symptoms of carnitine deficiency, such as myalgia and muscle stiffness (3619). However, other studies have found no significant effect of isotretinoin on carnitine blood levels (11557). There is not enough information to recommend routine use of L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplements with isotretinoin.\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking phenobarbital.\nData on the effect of phenobarbital on blood levels of carnitines are conflicting. Some studies have found reduced levels in some patients taking phenobarbital (1911, 12758). However, other studies have found no significant effect (1910, 1913, 4526). Routine L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation does not seem to be necessary.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking phenytoin.\nData on the effect of phenytoin on blood levels of carnitines are conflicting. Some studies have found reduced levels in some patients on phenytoin (1911, 4528). However, other studies have found no effect (4526). Routine L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation does not seem to be necessary.\nless\nPIVAMPICILLIN (Pondocillin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking pivampicillin.\nThis antibiotic is a prodrug which liberates the active antibiotic and pivalate in the body. Pivalate combines with L-carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (11553, 12759). Theoretically, losses of propionyl-L-carnitine could also be increased. Short courses of pivampicillin decrease blood concentrations of L-carnitine, but tissue levels appear to be unaffected. Treatment for 1-2 months causes decreases in muscle L-carnitine, and treatment for 6 months or longer may cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency (11553, 12759). Routine L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary unless therapy is prolonged or the patient has other factors contributing to low L-carnitine stores.\nless\nPIVMECILLINAM (Selexid)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking pivmecillinam.\nThis antibiotic is a prodrug which liberates the active antibiotic and pivalate in the body. Pivalate combines with L-carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (11553, 12759).

The mechanism of this effect is not known and further data is needed before L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine depletion can be linked to these drugs.\nless\nSULFADIAZINE\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking sulfadiazine.\nA single case report describes symptomatic L-carnitine deficiency in a patient treated with pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine which reversed when both drugs were stopped (14600). The mechanism of this effect is not known and further data is needed before L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine depletion can be linked to these drugs.\nless\nVALPROATE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking valproate.\nValproic acid can reduce blood and tissue carnitine levels (1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 4526, 4528, 12758, 15506, 15508). Valproic acid interferes with L-carnitine biosynthesis in the liver and forms a valproylcarnitine ester, which is excreted in the urine, reducing tubular reabsorption of free carnitine (4528, 4529, 5798, 15508). Reduced L-carnitine levels are not clinically significant in most people taking valproic acid. However, some patients may be at increased risk for L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid, and this may contribute to the development of hyperammonemia and hepatotoxicity associated with the drug (1916, 1917, 5798). Risk factors for symptomatic L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid include age less than 2 years, severe neurological problems including mental retardation, taking multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor nutrition, and use of the ketogenic diet (4528, 5798, 9612). Some experts recommend L-carnitine supplements for people with these risk factors who need to take valproic acid (4523, 4526, 4528, 4529, 5798). There is no data on the use of propionyl-L-carnitine supplements in people taking valproic acid. Supplements of carnitines aren't necessary for most people taking valproic acid who are otherwise healthy and consuming a diet adequate in L-carnitine (9612, 15507).\nless\nZIDOVUDINE (Retrovir)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking zidovudine.\nLow L-carnitine blood levels are found in some people with HIV infection. Zidovudine seems to exacerbate this, and can also lower muscle carnitine levels, which is linked to symptoms of myopathy (3617, 3618, 11551). Zidovudine interferes with mitochondrial transport of L-carnitine into muscle cells (3617, 9885). In vitro data suggest L-carnitine supplements might improve functioning of muscle cells affected by zidovudine (3617, 9885), but there is not enough data to recommend routine use of L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine supplements for patients taking zidovudine.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with propionyl-L-carnitine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOral intake of propionyl-L-carnitine increases plasma levels of carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine (94443).\nDistribution\nEndogenous carnitines exist as a \"carnitine pool\" consisting of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and several other acyl-carnitine esters. Cell membrane transporters can rapidly transport them between the tissues and extracellular space (12683, 12744).\nMetabolism\nEndogenous carnitines exist as a \"carnitine pool\" consisting of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and several other acyl-carnitine esters. Intracellular enzymes can rapidly interconvert the carnitines to the needed form (12683, 12744).\nExcretion\nPropionyl-L-carnitine is excreted in the urine (94441). The kidneys aid in keeping carnitine levels stable in the body. Normally, greater than 90% of filtered carnitine is reabsorbed. If dietary intake of carnitines decreases, carnitine reabsorption becomes even more efficient (12683, 12744).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPropionyl-L-carnitine is found naturally in most cells in the body. Endogenous carnitines exist as a \"carnitine pool\" consisting of L-carnitine, acetyl-l-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and several other acyl-carnitine esters. Intracellular enzymes and cell membrane transporters can rapidly interconvert the carnitines to the needed form and transport them between the tissues and extracellular space. The body obtains some carnitine from the diet, primarily from red meats and dairy products. The body can also synthesize carnitines from the amino acids, lysine and methionine. The kidneys aid in keeping carnitine levels stable. Normally, greater than 90% of filtered carnitine is reabsorbed. If dietary intake of carnitines decreases, carnitine reabsorption becomes even more efficient (12683, 12744).\n\nThere may be altered homeostasis and reduced levels of L-carnitine in peripheral vascular disease, myocardial ischemia, and heart failure (1572). Carnitine deficiency most often presents with symptoms of progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness, and less frequently with fasting hypoglycemic coma (12748). In patients with alcohol induced cirrhosis, serum levels of L-carnitine and its esters are sometimes increased, possibly due to increase L-carnitine biosynthesis (1931, 1948).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPropionyl-L-carnitine is of interest for inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. It seems to reduce intestinal mucosal inflammatory processes and damage (94449). Anti-inflammatory effects of propionyl-L-carnitine have also been shown in animal models. The mechanism of action appears to involve a reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species and a role for nitric oxide in the production of new blood vessels during dermal regeneration (94450).\nCardiovascular effects\nPropionyl-L-carnitine improves energy, metabolism, and myocardial contractility in experimental models of heart failure (1577). Small studies suggest that propionyl-L-carnitine may have a positive inotropic effect and improve ventricular function and cardiac output in chronic heart failure (1571, 1572, 1573). It reduces myocardial ischemia, as measured by ST segment depression, in people with angina (1573, 1579). Compared with L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine may produce greater increases in cellular L-carnitine concentrations, possibly by being transported into muscle fibers easier, and may provide additional substrates for muscle-cell energy production. Heart tissues may be able to utilize exogenous propionyl-L-carnitine to stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and protect against ischemia (1439).\nErectile function effects\nCarnitines, including propionyl-L-carnitine, are increased by male and female sex hormones (12353). Theoretically, propionyl-L-carnitine improves vasodilation and enhances penile blood flow, resulting in improved erectile function (12682). Preliminary research also suggests propionyl-L-carnitine might have anti-inflammatory effects, which might be responsible for its effect in Peyronie disease (12683, 12684, 12685).\nErgogenic effects\nGlycine propionyl-L-carnitine is a specific type of propionyl-L-carnitine used for exercise performance. Although the exercise performance effects of propionyl-L-carnitine are still being debated, potential benefits might be related to an increase in blood flow to muscles following increased levels of nitric oxide causing vasodilation (94444, 94445).\nMetabolic effects\nWithin cells, propionyl-L-carnitine helps to maintain mitochondrial acyl-CoA/CoA ratios which are increased in L-carnitine deficient states, leading to deficient metabolism of fatty acids and urea synthesis (1439). Propionyl-L-carnitine also increases pyruvate flux into the Krebs Cycle, stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, has free radical scavenging activity, improves homeostasis in the coagulation cascade, and has positive effects on blood viscosity (1578).\nPhysical functioning effects\nIntravenous and oral treatment with propionyl-L-carnitine may improve physical functioning in some people with peripheral vascular disease (1434, 1435, 1436, 1437, 1576), but a study suggesting that propionyl-L-carnitine was superior to L-carnitine in this regard used only single intravenous doses, and the clinical significance of the difference was questionable (1437). Compared with L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine may produce greater increases in cellular L-carnitine concentrations, possibly by being transported into muscle fibers easier, and may provide additional substrates for muscle-cell energy production (1439).\nWeight effects\nAn individual clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking propionyl-L-carnitine has no effect on body mass index when compared with placebo (107393)."

            "Overview": "Propolis is a natural flavonoid-rich resin produced by bees from digested tree buds and barks. It is used by bees to construct, repair, and protect hives (70056, 70103, 92794). Propolis literally translates from the Greek words Pro (before) and Polis (the city), referring to its use by bees to reduce the size of hive entrances (70082). In addition to its pharmacotherapeutic applications, propolis is commonly found in chewing gum, cosmetics, creams, lozenges, and ointments (92794).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using propolis for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Propolis has been used with apparent safety in clinical research at doses of up to 1500 mg daily (95883, 99173, 102520, 102521). ...when used topically. Propolis as a 3% or 10% ointment, 0.5% cream, 30% mouth rinse, or 15% solution has been used with apparent safety in small clinical studies (799, 1926, 6602, 8663, 17629, 17664, 17665, 92793, 92800, 95882)(99171, 99173, 102519, 102521, 105785, 105786, 108516, 108523, 109985).\nPREGNANCY: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately during lactation.

In one case, a 30-year-old male presented with persistent abnormal liver enzymes for six months. With other causes ruled out, the patient disclosed using more than 10 propolis lozenges per day for several months to treat a sore throat. Upon discontinuation of the propolis lozenges, liver enzymes returned to normal (105788). Despite concerns presented in this case, analyses of small clinical studies suggest that propolis may have hepatoprotective effects when used at doses of 500-1000 mg daily for up to one year (108521, 108522).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn one case report, a 36-year-old female developed severe erythematous papules and patches with edema of the face, neck, arms, abdomen, and thighs after consuming propolis solution for a few weeks. After symptom resolution, a patch test showed an extreme positive reaction to propolis (106443). In another case, laryngeal edema and severe anaphylactic reaction has been reported in a patient who used topical propolis for the treatment of acute pharyngitis. The patient died due to complications of hypoxia that resulted from the allergic reaction (70063).\n\nTopically, propolis-containing products can cause allergic contact dermatitis, including cheilitis, when used on or near the lips or mouth (15647, 92796, 92798, 102517). Propolis-containing lozenges can cause allergic reactions as well as acute oral mucositis with ulceration (2632).\n\nPatients allergic to bees or bee products may be more likely to experience allergic reactions to propolis.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, propolis may cause headache in some patients. In one clinical trial, around 7% of patients taking propolis 250 mg twice daily for 4 months reported mild headache (105786).\nless\nRenal\nIn one case report, a 59-year-old male with cholangiocarcinoma developed acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis after taking a Brazilian preparation of propolis 5 mL three times daily for 2 weeks. Renal function improved when propolis was discontinued. The patient restarted taking propolis and symptoms developed again and the patient again required hemodialysis. Symptoms of renal failure improved when propolis was finally discontinued. This product was not screened for contaminants; however, family members of this patient used the same product without apparent adverse effects (14300).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral propolis seems to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, some conflicting evidence exists.\nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials including 374 patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking propolis for 8 weeks to 6 months reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.5% and fasting plasma glucose by 14 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, significant improvements in insulin levels or measures of insulin resistance were lacking (102520). While this pooled analysis suggests that propolis is modestly effective for improving glycemic control, individual study results are mixed. Three of the trials in the analysis failed to demonstrate significant improvements in HbA1c or glucose levels; however, all of these studies were small and likely underpowered to detect meaningful improvements in glycemic control (102523, 102524, 102525). Other studies showed positive results, with reductions in HbA1c ranging from 0.9% to 1.1% and reductions in fasting plasma glucose ranging from 21 mg/dL to 26 mg/dL. The doses and durations of propolis therapy in these studies included 400 mg daily for 6 months (99173), 900 mg daily for 12 weeks (95883), and 500 mg three times daily for 8 weeks (102521).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Topical propolis ointment or cream, applied five times daily, may improve lesion healing and reduce symptoms in patients with cold sores.\nOne small clinical study in patients with cold sores shows that applying a specific propolis 3% ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX by Afexa), five times daily at the start of symptoms, reduces cold sore duration by about 3-4 days and may reduce cold sore-related pain when compared with placebo (17664, 17665). Larger clinical studies in patients with cold sores in the papular or vesicular stages show that applying a lip cream containing a specific propolis extract (GH2002) 0.5% five times daily for 5-10 days reduces the time to complete encrustation/epithelialization by about 1 day and improves symptoms of pain, burning, itching, tension, and swelling when compared with acyclovir 5% cream (95875, 102519).\nless\nOral mucositis. Most clinical research shows that oral propolis or propolis-containing mouthwash can reduce the risk for severe, chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials including 209 patients shows that using mouthwash containing propolis reduces the odds of severe chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis by 65% when compared with placebo in cancer patients (99171). Rinsing with 5-10 mL of a propolis mouth rinse for 1 minute three times daily, alone or in addition to chlorhexidine mouthwash and fluconazole for 7-14 days, improves mucositis and redness when compared to control in patients receiving chemotherapy (92793, 95877). A small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer also shows that taking tablets of propolis (Natur Farma S.A.S.) 80 mg two or three times daily for 3 weeks, in addition to rinsing with sodium bicarbonate solution, decreases the development of mucositis when compared with only rinsing with sodium bicarbonate solution (95882). However, at least one high quality clinical study shows that rinsing with 7 mL of a specific product (Faringel, Cadigroup) containing propolis extract 6% and other ingredients three times daily for 6 weeks does not prevent the development of mucositis due to chemotherapy when compared with placebo in patients with head and neck cancer (95879).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in healthy male military cadets shows that taking propolis 450 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve measures of aerobic or anaerobic performance during exercise testing when compared with placebo (108519).\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if oral propolis can prevent atopic disease in lactating adults or their infants.\nA small clinical study in lactating adults shows that taking propolis 300 mg daily for 4-10 months does not appear to reduce the risk for developing atopic disease in either the mothers or their infants when compared with placebo (102518). However, due to the small sample size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with breast cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with stage II or III breast cancer receiving chemotherapy shows that taking propolis 250 mg twice daily for 3 months improves quality of life and nutritional status when compared with placebo (108518). It is unknown if propolis can increase the likelihood of survival or remission in patients with breast cancer.\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial in patients with minor burns.\nOne small clinical study in patients with minor burns shows that application of propolis cream to burn wounds every 3 days improves healing and reduces inflammation when compared with silver sulfadiazine. Propolis cream seems to be as effective for preventing infection as silver sulfadiazine in these patients (8663).\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with canker sores.\nA very small clinical study in patients with recurrent canker sores shows that taking propolis 500 mg daily for 6-13 months significantly reduces canker sore outbreaks and improves quality of life when compared with placebo. A 50% or greater reduction in cold sore outbreaks was reported in 60% and 11% of patients taking propolis or placebo, respectively (17629).\nless\nCatheter-related infections. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial for the prevention of catheter-related infections.\nOne small clinical study in patients with peritoneal dialysis catheters shows that cleaning the exit site after dialysis with a normal saline wash and propolis 10% ointment for 6 months does not reduce the rate of catheter site infections when compared with using normal saline wash plus mupirocin 2% ointment or normal saline wash alone (109985).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with CKD.\nA small clinical study in patients with CKD shows that taking Brazilian green propolis extract (EPP-AF) 250 mg twice daily for 12 months reduces proteinuria, but does not increase estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), when compared with placebo (105785).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral propolis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with frequent exacerbations of COPD shows that taking a combination of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 1200 mg and propolis 160 mg orally once daily for 3 months reduces the incidence of acute exacerbations during 1 year of follow-up when compared with placebo or a lower dose combination of NAC 600mg and propolis 80 mg (109984). Further research shows that using the higher dose combination for 6 months reduces acute exacerbations, cough, and overall COPD severity, and increases dyspnea-free walking distance, when compared with placebo or the lower dose combination (109986).\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with the common cold.\nOne small clinical study in patients with rhinovirus infection shows that taking propolis (dose and duration unknown) might decrease the duration of cold symptoms 2.5-fold when compared with placebo (6602).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\nA small observational study in healthcare professionals working in an emergency department shows that taking a 30% Anatolian propolis solution as 20 drops twice daily for one month reduces the occurrence of COVID-19 positivity to 2 of 102 subjects, compared with 14 of 102 in an untreated control group (109983). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and randomization.\n\nA small, open-label clinical study in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 shows that taking a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF) 100 mg or 200 mg four times daily for 7 days, along with conventional therapy, reduces length of hospital stay by around 5-6 days, but does not affect the need for supplemental oxygen, odds of intubation, or admission to the intensive care unit, when compared with conventional therapy alone (108514).\nless\nDengue fever. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with dengue fever.\nA small clinical study in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever shows that taking propolis extract (Propoelix) 400 mg three times daily for 7 days reduces the length of hospital stay by about 18 hours when compared with placebo. This was based on being deemed technically fit for discharge because of a recovery of platelet counts. The effect of propolis on other symptoms of dengue fever was not investigated in this study (99168).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if topical propolis, used either as a chewing gum or mouthwash, can prevent dental caries in children.\nOne small clinical trial in children 6-8 years of age at high risk of dental caries shows that chewing propolis gum twice daily for 20 minutes or rinsing with 10 mL of propolis 2% mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for 2 weeks reduces plaque and Streptococcus mutans count when compared to baseline. There were no differences between the two propolis formulations; however, children preferred the chewing gum over the mouthwash (105790). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nDenture stomatitis. Small clinical studies suggest that topical propolis may speed recovery in patients with denture stomatitis.\nOne very small clinical study in denture-bearing patients with prosthesis stomatitis candidiasis shows that applying Brazilian green propolis 20% ethanol extract topically four times daily for 7 days can cause regression of candidiasis lesions. After 7 days, 58% of patients treated with propolis and 67% of patients treated with nystatin had total lesion remission. After 15 days, all patients in both groups saw total lesion remission (70070). Also, two small clinical studies in patients with denture-induced oral mucositis show that applying propolis 2% to 3% gel (EPP-AF) to dentures three to four times daily for 7-14 days improves the cure rate and reduces erythema. In these studies, propolis appeared to be comparable to applying miconazole to dentures (95881, 95884).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial as adjunct therapy in patients with depression.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate to severe depression inadequately managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) shows that taking propolis 1000 mg daily for 6 weeks, in addition to SSRI therapy, reduces symptoms of depression, as measured on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), when compared with placebo (108523).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that topical application of propolis 5% ointment in addition to routine care for 4 weeks reduces ulcer size about 2.5-fold more than routine care alone (99172).\nless\nGenital herpes. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial in patients with genital herpes.\nA small clinical study in patients with recurrent genital herpes caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) shows that applying propolis 3% ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX by Afexa) four times daily for 10 days reduces healing time and increases the relative rate of complete healing by 1.7- and 2-fold when compared with acyclovir 5% ointment and placebo, respectively (1926).\nless\nGingivitis. Small clinical studies suggest that topical propolis may modestly improve symptoms in patients with gingivitis.\nA small clinical study shows that rinsing with a propolis 2% solution 20 mL twice daily for 21 days is as effective as a rinse containing sodium fluoride 0.05% plus cetylpyridinium chloride 0.05% for the prevention of induced gingival redness and bleeding (99169). Another small clinical study in patients with gingivitis shows that rinsing with a propolis solution twice daily for 4 weeks reduces gingival bleeding, but does not improve plaque index, when compared with placebo (108513).\n\nPropolis has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study in patients with plaque-induced gingivitis shows that adjuvant therapy with a topical gel containing propolis and other ingredients (Oralsan NBF gel, IDS SpA) for 15 days following scaling and root planing is as effective as a chlorhexidine-based gel for improving bleeding, plaque, and probing depth (99170). Another small clinical study in patients with generalized or localized gingivitis or stage I periodontitis shows that taking 194 mg of a product containing propolis and mangosteen improves the modified gingival index by 31% or 40% at weeks 4 or 8, respectively, compared with 16% or 25% in those receiving placebo. No changes in probing depth, clinical attachment, plaque index, bleeding, or gingival recession were observed (106789).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with H. pylori infection.\nOne very small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with H. pylori infection shows that taking 60 drops of an alcoholic preparation of Brazilian green propolis daily for 7 days does not reduce H. pylori infection when compared to baseline (70107).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral propolis as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of propolis for this purpose.\nIntestinal parasite infection. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with giardiasis.\nOne small clinical study in adults with giardia infection shows that taking a specific propolis 30% extract (Propolisina, Apis Flora) for 5 days increases cure rates when compared with tinidazole. The cure rate was 60% with propolis extract, compared to only 40% with tinidazole. In children with giardiasis, taking propolis 10% extract showed a 52% cure rate; however, the rate of cure with tinidazole was not available (70121).\nless\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral red propolis is beneficial in malnourished children with frequent respiratory tract infections.\nA small clinical study in children aged 1-5 years with frequent respiratory tract infections and growth failure associated with malnutrition shows that giving 3% red propolis in 8 mL (10 grams) of honey once daily in addition to adequate nutrition does not improve weight gain or reduce the frequency of respiratory infections when compared with honey plus adequate nutrition (109987).\nless\nMuscle fatigue. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial for speeding recovery from muscle fatigue.\nOne small study in young, healthy males shows that taking Brazilian green propolis 1575 mg before meals three times daily for one week, followed by exercise to induce muscle fatigue, reduces the time to regain maximal contraction torque after stopping when compared with placebo or a 100-mg dose of propolis. There was no difference in average peak power between the groups (109989).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nOne small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking propolis extract 250 mg twice daily for 4 months improves markers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, but does not improve liver function, when compared with placebo (105786). Another small study in adults with obesity and NAFLD shows that taking propolis 510 mg daily for 8 weeks with a calorie-restricted diet reduces liver fibrosis, fasting blood glucose levels, serum insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect the severity of fatty liver, anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, or levels of inflammatory markers (109988).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral propolis for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of propolis for this purpose.\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral propolis or propolis extract rinse is beneficial in patients with periodontitis.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis also receiving scaling and root planing shows that taking propolis 400 mg daily for 6 months reduces probing depth and improves clinical attachment by a small amount when compared with scaling and planing alone. There was no additional benefit with propolis on measures of gingivitis, plaque, or bleeding when compared with scaling and planing alone (99173). Another very small clinical study in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that irrigation of the gums with an ethanol solution containing propolis extract 20% twice weekly for 2 weeks reduces gum bleeding when compared with irrigation with ethanol 14% solution (95876).\n\nPropolis has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients with generalized or localized gingivitis or stage I periodontitis shows that taking 194 mg of a product containing propolis and mangosteen improves the modified gingival index by 31% or 40% at weeks 4 or 8, respectively, compared with 16% or 25% in those receiving placebo. No changes in probing depth, clinical attachment, plaque index, bleeding, or gingival recession were observed (106789).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with RA.\nA small clinical study in females with RA shows that taking Brazilian propolis 508.5 mg daily for 24 weeks does not improve measures of disease activity, quality of life, or activities of daily living when compared with placebo (108515).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with sepsis.\nA small clinical study in patients with pneumosepsis shows that taking propolis 1000 mg daily along with conventional therapy does not improve survival rates or disease severity, as measured using APACHE II and SOFA scores, when compared with placebo. The combination of propolis 1000 mg plus melatonin 20 mg daily did improve disease severity scores but had no effect on survival (108524).\nless\nTinea pedis. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial in patients with tinea pedis.\nA case series involving students with athlete's foot found that topical treatment with a 100 mg/mL ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis results in less skin itching, peeling, and redness when compared with petroleum jelly placebo, but not when compared with miconazole (95880).\nless\nTuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral propolis for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of propolis for this purpose.\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral propolis spray is beneficial in patients with URTI.\nOne small clinical study in patients reporting mild URTI symptoms shows that use of a propolis oral spray (M.E.D. Propolis, B Natural srl), 2-4 sprays daily, providing 6 mg of polyphenols per spray, for 5 days reduces the time to complete resolution of symptoms by 2 days when compared with placebo (105787).\n\nPropolis has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical study in children 1-5 years of age shows that taking 5-7.5 mL of a specific combination product (Chizukit, Hadas Corp Ltd.) containing propolis 50 mg/mL, echinacea extract 50 mg/mL, and vitamin C 10 mg/mL for 12 weeks reduces the number of children who experience one or more upper respiratory tract illnesses, as well as the number and duration of illnesses, when compared with placebo (48551). It is unclear if these findings are due to propolis, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral propolis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in adults with uncomplicated UTIs shows that taking combination products containing propolis, Hibiscus sabdariffa, and gelatin or xyloglucan daily for 5-10 days, then daily for two weeks each month for two months, reduces the odds of UTI recurrence by 87% when compared with control (108520). One of these studies used a specific product (Utipro Plus, Noventure) containing propolis 100 mg, xyloglucan extract 100 mg, Hibiscus sabdariffa extract 100 mg, and gelatin 50 mg once daily for 15 consecutive days each month for 6 months (101734). A small clinical study in females with recurrent UTIs shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (DUAB, Nutrivercell) containing propolis, cranberry, and zinc daily for 6 months reduces the number of recurrent UTIs by around 0.8 and delays the time to first recurrent UTI by around 26 days when compared with placebo (102522).\nless\nVaginitis. It is unclear if topical propolis is beneficial in patients with vaginitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic vaginitis shows that applying 50 mL of a specific aqueous solution containing propolis 5% (Melprotect, Melbrosin International) to the vagina for 7 days can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life when compared to baseline (70068). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nWarts. It is unclear if oral propolis is beneficial in patients with warts.\nOne small clinical study in adults and children with common and plane warts shows that taking propolis (Bee Propolis, Pollen) 500 mg orally daily for up to 3 months increases wart cure rates when compared with echinacea or placebo. Common warts were cured in 73% of patients taking propolis, compared to 20% taking echinacea and 8% taking placebo. Plane warts were cured in 75% of patients taking propolis, compared with 36% taking echinacea and 21% taking placebo. Neither propolis nor echinacea were effective for treating plantar warts (92800).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical propolis or propolis mouth rinse improves wound healing.\nOne small clinical study shows that using an aqueous alcohol mouth rinse containing propolis 5% five times daily for 1 week following sulcoplasty improves healing and reduces pain and inflammation (799). Another small clinical study in males recovering from surgery for sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease shows that using 1 mL of propolis 15% solution on the wound dressing daily for 28 days accelerates wound healing when compared with normal saline (108516) However, another small clinical trial in patients undergoing dental surgery shows that using a propolis 20% solution in a dressing is no more effective than the dressing alone for improving wound healing and reducing pain associated with the wound (99167).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate propolis for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPropolis is a resinous material made by bees from digested tree buds and bark. Bees use it for maintaining their hives. Since propolis is incorporated into beehives, harvesting the pure product is difficult, requiring an extraction process with glycol and ethyl alcohol to remove beeswax. Many propolis preparations are frequently contaminated with beehive by-products (3574, 109983). Raw propolis contains about 50% resins and vegetable balsams, 30% waxes, 10% essential and aromatic oils, 5% pollen, and 5% other bioactive compounds. Bioactive compounds present include phenolics and flavonoids, including quercetin and galangin, as well as terpenes, cinnamic acid and its esters, caffeic acid and its esters, artepillin-C, culifolin, amines, amides, polysaccharides, amino acids, and minerals (99169, 99171, 99173, 109983). The constituents of propolis can vary with the growing region and variety. Red propolis contains the flavonols retusapurpurin A and B, which give it its color (109987, 109988).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that propolis might suppress the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and decrease the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes involved in inflammation (2630). In humans, propolis reduces levels of inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (99168, 105786, 105789, 108521, 108524).\nAntibacterial effects\nPropolis contains flavonoids including pinocembrin, galangin, pinobanksin, and pinobanksin-3-acetate, which are thought to be responsible for its antibacterial effects (1926). Propolis extracts that contain the constituents pinocembrin and galangin have been shown to inhibit the growth and enzyme activity of Streptococcus mutans, an organism that causes dental caries (2631). Propolis also seems to have in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of bacteria that cause periodontal disease such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum (8664, 95876).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome clinical research shows that propolis can improve certain markers of glycemic control. However, the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Some experimental studies suggest that constituents of propolis might stimulate the production of insulin, improve cellular insulin sensitivity, enhance glucose uptake by GLUT4, and/or inhibit gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of propolis are also thought to play a role (102520).\nAntifungal properties\nIn vitro research shows that propolis has antifungal activity against Candida species (70053, 70070, 70090, 70094), Trichosporon species (70090, 70094), and Rhodotorula species (70090).\nAntineoplastic effects\nPropolis contains caffeic acid phenethyl esters (CAPE), which might have cancer chemopreventative properties (2629). In vitro research suggests that the cytotoxic potential of propolis depends on the geographical origin of propolis products, as brown and red propolis were shown to have the highest cytotoxic potential while green propolis had low cytotoxic potential, and yellow propolis had cytotoxic activity against only one of the tumor cell lines studied (92795).\nAntioxidant effects\nChilean propolis has been shown to have antioxidant properties as scavenger of free radicals (70064). Propolis has also been studied for antiradical properties to protect food from oxidation (70096). It has also been suggested that the potential antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of propolis may be due to the action of phenylpropanoid constituents (70104).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn an in vitro study, an ethanolic extract of propolis was shown to inhibit growth and adherence of Giardia duodenalis trophozoites. Propolis also promoted the detachment of trophozoites. Light microscope observations revealed changes of the pear-shaped aspect of the cell and reduction of flagellar beating frequency in the great part of the trophozoites (70076).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research suggests that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) derived from propolis markedly inhibits platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen. Since CAPE is involved in various inhibitory pathways of platelet aggregation, propolis may be a potent antiplatelet agent (50794).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, propolis constituents have activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which causes genital herpes (1926, 17630). In vitro research also shows that pinocembrin, a phenolic constituent of propolis, can potentially bind to the spike 1 protein on the surface of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (109983).\nDetoxification effects\nThere is interest in using propolis to remove toxins from the body. A small clinical study in people who smoke 20 or more cigarettes daily shows that consuming propolis 600 mg daily for 4 weeks increases urinary excretion of tobacco carcinogens and nicotine (102176).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome clinical research suggests that propolis has hepatoprotective effects. Meta-analyses of 5-6 small clinical studies shows that propolis slightly reduces levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) when compared with placebo or other controls. However, these analyses have reported inconsistent results related to the effect of propolis on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (108521, 108522). While the mechanism of these effects is unclear, it is thought that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of propolis play a role. Additionally, several constituents in propolis have demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in animal and in vitro studies (108522).\nImmune effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that propolis might improve immune response in people with weakened immune systems due to HIV/AIDS. A small clinical study in adults with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral therapy shows that taking propolis 500 mg daily for 3 months increases the proliferation of lymphocytes and enhances the expression of Foxp3, an important gene involved in the production of regulatory T cells (108517).\nRadioprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that propolis has radioprotective effects, which are attributed to its free radical-scavenging properties. In vitro research suggests that propolis extract protects against DNA damage induced by gamma irradiation, with a decrease in the radiation-induced chromosome aberrations observed to be higher than 50% for all the doses (70073).\nWound healing effects\nTopically applied propolis seems to help accelerate epithelial repair in animal models (800)."

The proteolytic enzymes classified as endopeptidases, those which hydrolyze peptide bonds within the protein, are subdivided based on their active site: serine, aspartic, cysteine, and metallo (102708, 102709).\n\nIn the body, proteolytic enzymes have numerous roles, including intracellular protein degradation, the control of physiologically active peptides, antigen presentation and recognition as part of cellular immune response, muscle remodeling and function, collagen turnover, digestion, blood clotting, and complement activation (102708, 102709). Pathological changes in the activity of proteolytic enzymes results in muscle inflammation, damage, and wasting. In addition, changes in activity of proteolytic enzymes are at least partially responsible for modifications in muscle development that occur both as benefits and side effects of some medications (102708).\n\nIntracellular protein degradation is needed for the normal turnover of protein in the functioning of cells. Proteolytic enzymes involved in this process include the cathepsins (lysosomes), the calpains (cytoplasm), and the multicatalytic proteinase (nucleus and cytoplasm). The activity of many of these proteases is controlled by cellular inhibitors. Inappropriate or pathological activity plays a role in various disorders including joint inflammation, muscle breakdown including cachexia and sarcopenia, lung disorders, and dementia (102708).\n\nSome proteolytic enzymes exert cellular actions via a family of four proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)s. Enzymes using this family of receptors include thrombin, kallikreins, trypsin, tryptase, and others. In addition, some proteolytic enzymes regulate growth factor receptors. These proteolytic enzymes regulate cellular pathways involved in various functions in the vascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, nervous, and other systems. Pathological activity of these enzymes might be involved in inflammation, pain, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other disorders (102711, 102712, 102713).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nProteolytic enzymes are of interest for rheumatoid arthritis. In humans and in animal models of edema, orally administered proteolytic enzymes have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. The mechanism of action might be related to an inhibition in endogenous proteinases following increased activity of proteinase inhibitors. The proteolytic enzymes reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent T cell response ( 67832).\nImmune effects\nProteolytic enzymes are of interest for rheumatoid arthritis. In human research, taking oral proteolytic enzymes decreases levels of circulating immune complexes and increases levels of the complement component iC3b ( 67832).\nWound healing effects\nProteolytic enzymes are involved in wound healing. For example, collagenase breaks down clots and is then involved in the remodeling of collagen. Elastase breaks down elastin to allow for more collagen deposition. Some proteolytic enzymes degrade necrotic tissue following breakdown of the cell (102709)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Psilocybin is an indolealkylamine that acts as a psychedelic or hallucinogenic compound (106143, 106173). Psilocybin is found in mushrooms that are sometimes referred to as \"magic mushrooms,\" usually in the genus Psilocybe (106143, 106156, 106165). It can also be manufactured synthetically. Traditionally, mushrooms containing psilocybin have been used in religious or spiritual rituals; they have also been used recreationally and medicinally (106156, 106161, 106171, 106173, 110800).",
            "Warnings": "The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists psilocybin as a Schedule I controlled substance (106143).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when single doses are used orally with appropriate medical supervision. Single doses of synthetic psilocybin 0.2-0.6 mg/kg have been used without evidence of serious adverse events in small clinical trials. These trials provided controlled settings conducive to a positive emotional state, employed various safety measures, and offered social support via an experience guide (106131, 106135, 106143, 106150, 106154, 106162, 106165, 108643, 110800).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of psilocybin when used orally in any dose, including micro doses, without supervision (106152, 106160). The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists psilocybin as a Schedule I controlled substance (106143). However, most research suggests that the potential for abuse is low (106137, 106143) and there is no evidence of physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms (106143). There is also insufficient reliable information available about the safety of psilocybin when used intravenously.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, psilocybin seems to be generally well tolerated when single doses are used with appropriate medical supervision. However, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists psilocybin as a Schedule I controlled substance and a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes related to its use without medical supervision, including in micro dosing amounts, has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Anxiety, changes in mood, confusion, emotional disorder, fatigue, fear, hallucinations, headache, hypertension, nausea, paranoia, recurring drug-like experiences, and tachycardia.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Acute kidney failure, encephalopathy, post-traumatic flashbacks, rhabdomyolysis.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, psilocybin in single doses of 0.2-0.6 mg/kg have been shown to dose-dependently increase the resting heart rate by up to 11 beats per minute (106132, 106138, 106139, 106142, 106165, 106167, 108649, 108939). However, decreased heart rate has also been reported in clinical research (110800). In clinical trials, single doses of psilocybin as low as 0.2 mg/kg have been shown to have a moderate or large effect on blood pressure. These effects have been observed in up to 34% of participants (106129, 106132, 106135, 106137, 106138, 106139, 106142, 106147, 106150, 106151)(106157, 106162, 106167, 108649, 108939, 110784, 110791, 113865, 113867, 113871). Increases in heart rate and blood pressure appear to peak about 2 hours after psilocybin intake and last for up to approximately 6 hours (106138, 108939). However, psilocybin does not seem to prolong the QTc interval or result in sustained tachyarrhythmias or heart block (106138, 106165).\n\nA case of psilocybin-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which often mimics an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on initial presentation, and a case of myocardial infarction have been reported following ingestion of the Psilocybe seminlanceata mushroom (106183, 108646). Additionally, a 24-year-old female with a previous heart transplant due to end-stage rheumatic heart disease experienced fatal cardiac arrest after consuming psilocybin-containing mushrooms (106143). In the case of adverse effects linked to mushrooms containing psilocybin; it is unclear if these events are due to psilocybin, other constituents, or the combination. Additionally, the actual psilocybin content of the mushrooms is often unknown.\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, psilocybin in a single dose of 315 mcg/kg resulted in increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (106157). The effects of lower doses of psilocybin are unclear.\n\nOrally, psilocybin in a single dose of 25 mg has resulted in decreased libido in a single case (110800) and transient asymptomatic hypoglycemia in 2 adult females with anorexia nervosa (113870).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, single doses of psilocybin have resulted in nausea, and rarely, vomiting and diarrhea (106129, 106131, 106132, 106134, 106137, 106161, 106162, 106167, 106178, 106182)(108644, 108939, 110400, 110784, 110791, 110794, 110797, 110800, 113864, 113870)(113865, 113868, 113869, 113871). Analysis from a large clinical trial that evaluated single doses of psilocybin 1 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg suggests that for every 5 patients treated with psilocybin 25 mg over psilocybin 1 mg, one additional case of nausea will occur (110400, 113873). There appears to be a dose-response relationship between psilocybin intake and nausea (113866, 113873).\n\nMost information related to the adverse effects of psilocybin is based on small clinical trials of purified psilocybin or surveys of individuals ingesting psilocybin from Psilocybe mushrooms. There is limited information available regarding adverse effects associated with micro dosing with psilocybin. In a survey of 278 individuals who reported micro dosing, physiological discomfort, including visions, numbness, temperature dysregulation, insomnia, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues, was reported in about 18% of responders. Impaired focus and cognition, excessive or inadequate energy, increased anxiety, and worsening changes or swings in mood were reported in 2.3% to 8.8% of responders (106186). However, only 18% of these participants reported micro dosing with psilocybin alone, and 12% used both psilocybin and LSD.\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, a single dose of psilocybin 315 mcg/kg increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and gamma glutamyltransferase, but not other liver enzymes (106157). The effects of lower doses of psilocybin are unclear.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nSevere rhabdomyolysis, followed by acute kidney failure and posterior encephalopathy resulting in short-term vision loss, disorientation, agitation, and seizures has been reported in a 25-year-old male following use of an unknown quantity of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. The patient required treatment to achieve blood volume homeostasis as well as respiratory support and treatment with corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. The patient recovered over a period of a few weeks. Although these adverse effects were thought to be associated with the use of Psilocybe cubensis, no measurement of psilocybin in the mushroom, blood, or urine was conducted. In addition, a drug screen was positive for opiates, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), benzodiazepines, and methadone (106181). There is a case of rhabdomyolysis thought to be secondary to an acute psychosis episode following the use of magic mushrooms 2 grams containing psilocybin by an 18-year-old male. The patient required intravenous fluids (110795).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, single doses of psilocybin have resulted in mild to moderate headache in numerous case studies and experimental studies. Headaches have been reported in up to 50% of individuals, starting a mean of 7 hours after intake and lasting for 1-2 days. Severity and duration seem to be dose-dependent (106129, 106131, 106132, 106134, 106135, 106137, 106142, 106166, 106173, 108644)(108939, 110400, 110784, 110791, 110794, 110800, 113864, 113867, 113868, 113870)(113865, 113869, 113871). Additionally, an analysis indicates there may be a dose-response relationship between psilocybin intake and headache (113866).\n\nInsomnia, drowsiness, and dizziness have been reported rarely (106137, 106157, 108644, 110400, 110794, 110797, 110800). Some research also shows a dose-related negative effect of psilocybin on certain measures of cognitive function, especially working memory (106155, 106167, 106170). However, a clinical study in healthy adults shows that single 10- or 25-mg doses of psilocybin do not produce clinically relevant detrimental short- or long-term effects on cognitive or social functioning or emotional processing when compared with placebo (108648).\n\nMost information related to the adverse effects of psilocybin is based on small clinical trials of purified psilocybin or surveys of individuals ingesting psilocybin from Psilocybe mushrooms. There is limited information available regarding adverse effects associated with micro dosing with psilocybin. In a survey of 278 individuals who reported micro dosing, physiological discomfort, including visions, numbness, temperature dysregulation, insomnia, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues, was reported in about 18% of responders.

In addition, a drug screen was positive for opiates, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), benzodiazepines, and methadone (106181).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, psilocybin increases pupil size. At higher doses, it also seems to impair normal light-induced pupil constriction when compared with placebo (108649).\nless\nPsychiatric\nPsilocybin has psychedelic or hallucinogenic effects, with side effects including visual, auditory, tactile, and other illusions, as well as changes in time and space perception, and \"mystical experiences\". The severity of some of these responses may be dose-dependent (106129, 106137, 106138, 106146, 106150, 106154, 106157, 106159, 106161, 106162)(106167, 106170, 106174, 106178, 106179, 108648, 109479, 110800, 113864, 113871). In clinical studies in healthy adults, recurring drug-like experiences, mostly visual in nature, have been described, sometimes more than 24 hours after administration of psilocybin, either alone or in combination with LSD (108644, 108647). Flashbacks lasted for seconds to minutes, were mild in nature, and were perceived as neutral to pleasant (108647).\n\nHuman research has shown that psilocybin at doses of 0.071-0.429 mg/kg has some abuse potential, although this is unlikely (106137, 106143). However, the common positive subjective experiences following use, including the visual effects, insights, and meaningfulness, might act as reinforcing effects of psilocybin (106161). Repeated dosing may cause tolerance, but there is no evidence of physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms (106143).\n\nOrally, single doses of psilocybin in clinical research or case reports have resulted in transient confusion, fear, paranoia, anxiety, altered or euphoric mood, emotional disorder, panic attack, suicidal ideation and self-harm, and changes in emotional lability. These symptoms are generally mild to moderate (106129, 106131, 106132, 106134, 106138, 106142, 106143, 106154, 106156, 106157)(106159, 106162, 106182, 108644, 110400, 110784, 110794, 110797, 110800, 113864)(113865, 113866, 113869). However, a post-traumatic flashback has been reported to occur after psilocybin use, in one case resulting in nausea, tinnitus, panic, and insomnia (106162, 106182). In another case report; toxic metabolic encephalopathy with symptoms of psychosis, agitation, and disorganized, tangential thought processes have been reported after ingestion of psilocybin-containing chocolate in a previously healthy adolescent (113874). There are also cases of acute psychosis, possibly combined with mania and aggression, paranoid delusions, as well as with months-long mania and severe depression with suicidal ideation following the use of magic mushrooms containing psilocybin (106184, 110795, 110798). In clinical trials, some individuals have experienced severe anxiety which lasted days to weeks (106156, 106162), and one patient in a clinical trial sought psychiatric hospitalization for worsening depression after being administered psilocybin (113865). Most, but not all, of the individuals in these clinical trials had some pre-existing anxiety or depression.\n\nA survey of experiences after the ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin found that although feelings of well-being increased in most individuals, these feelings decreased in about 8% of the almost 2000 individuals surveyed. Although the amount of psilocybin taken by the respondents is unknown, an average dose of 25 mg, considered moderate to high, was estimated based on the amount of dried mushrooms consumed (106154). Similarly, while pre-existing suicidal thoughts remitted in some individuals, increased suicidality occurred in five individuals (106154). In addition, approximately 11% of individuals reported putting themselves or others in situations increasing the risk of physical harm. Physically aggressive behavior or violence was rare and was reported by less than 3% of those surveyed (106154).\n\nMost information related to the adverse effects of psilocybin is based on small clinical trials of purified psilocybin or surveys of individuals ingesting psilocybin from Psilocybe mushrooms. There is limited information available regarding adverse effects associated with micro dosing with psilocybin.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDepression. Clinical research in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or depression associated with cancer suggests that pure psilocybin, typically taken as a single 25 mg dose in combination with supportive or integrative psychotherapy by trained therapists, may improve symptoms of depression and increase the likelihood of remission. However, it is unclear how well psilocybin alone compares with antidepressant drugs or psychotherapy.\nMost clinical research shows that taking psilocybin, usually in combination with supportive or integrative psychotherapy, reduces symptoms of depression immediately post-treatment and for up to 12 months of follow-up, and reduces the likelihood of symptom worsening when compared with baseline, niacin placebo, low-dose psilocybin, or delayed treatment with psilocybin (106129, 106130, 106131, 106132, 106133, 106134, 106135, 106138, 106139, 108643)(110400, 110785, 110788, 110791, 110792, 113864, 113865, 113866, 113867, 113868)(113869, 113871, 113872). Collectively, the body of research consists of a mix of double-blind randomized clinical trials and small, open-label studies with varied populations. A number of meta-analyses evaluated these separately. Meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in patients diagnosed with MDD and 3 clinical trials in patients with depression associated with life-threatening cancer shows that taking psilocybin, in combination with supportive or integrative psychotherapy, reduces symptoms of depression when compared with placebo, wait list control, or low dose psilocybin. The analysis showed a large effect size, but with high heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of 7 of the clinical trials also shows that psilocybin improves the rate of remission from depression symptoms when compared with control, with low heterogeneity across the included studies. The remission rate was approximately 45% with psilocybin and 14% with control (113865). A similar meta-analysis of many of the same clinical studies shows that psilocybin reduces symptoms of depression and improves the rate of remission from depression symptoms, including among patients with cancer-related depression when compared with control (113869). The 2023 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Task Force suggests that only low-level evidence supports the use of psilocybin for major depressive disorder. Only 3 trials on patients with major depressive disorder and 3 trials on patients with cancer-related depression published up to 2021 were evaluated for this report (110793).\n\nRandomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of psilocybin in patients with MDD, including those with treatment-resistant depression. A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with MDD shows that taking a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg with psychological support reduces symptoms of depression as early as 8 days after treatment, with effects maintained across the 6-week follow-up period, when compared with niacin placebo. Additionally, the sustained depressive symptom remission rate was 27% with psilocybin and 8% with niacin (113864). Similarly, another clinical trial in patients with MDD shows that taking a single dose of psilocybin approximately 0.215 mg/kg reduces symptoms of depression two weeks after treatment compared with taking placebo. Also, up to 54% of patients were in remission compared with 12% of those taking placebo (110791). An additional clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant depression shows that taking a single dose of a specific psilocybin (COMP360) 25 mg, but not 10 mg, was more effective than taking psilocybin 1 mg for modestly reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety (110400, 110788). The odds of remission at 3 weeks was 4.8-fold higher in patients receiving psilocybin 25 mg, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5 (110400, 113873). Twelve weeks after treatment, symptoms of depression were still modestly reduced when compared with placebo (110788). However, remission was not sustained (110400). Also, 77% of participants experienced adverse effects including suicidal ideation and self-injury over the 12-week post-treatment period (110400).\n\nThe effectiveness of psilocybin has also been compared to that of conventional antidepressant medication. One clinical study compared psilocybin 25 mg given once and then again 3 weeks later with the conventional antidepressant escitalopram, taken 10 mg daily for 3 weeks and then 20 mg daily for an additional 3 weeks. In patients with depression who were also receiving psychological support, psilocybin treatment is as effective as escitalopram for reducing symptoms of depression. In addition, 57% of patients who took psilocybin achieved remission, compared with only 28% of those taking escitalopram (106166). There were also modest improvements in symptoms of rumination and thought suppression in the patients receiving psilocybin; benefits on thought suppression were statistically significant compared with escitalopram (110787). Additionally, there was no difference in the likelihood of symptom worsening with psilocybin when compared with escitalopram (113872). However, the 6-week study duration may have been inadequate to detect the full benefits of escitalopram.\n\nSmall, open-label studies in patients with MDD, including those with treatment-resistant depression, show that taking psilocybin in conjunction with integrative psychotherapy improves depression when compared to baseline (106131, 106133, 106134, 106135, 108643, 110796, 113867, 113868, 113871). In one study, 20% of patients were in remission 5 weeks after psilocybin treatment. These patients also experienced an improvement in suicidality and sexual dysfunction symptoms (106131). Personality traits, especially neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, as well as recognition of facial emotions, were improved for up to 3 months after psilocybin-facilitated treatment (106141, 106177). Three small open-label clinical studies in patients with cancer and depression show that taking a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg combined with integrative psychotherapy improves well-being (110796), symptoms of depression, and remission of depressive symptoms for up to 2 to 6 months of follow-up when compared to baseline (113868, 113871). However, no control group was used in most of these studies (106131, 106133, 106134, 106141, 106177, 110796, 113867, 113868, 113871).\n\nAn additional preliminary clinical trial in patients with major depressive disorder shows that treatment with psilocybin results in a clinically significant response, defined as a 50% reduction in the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, in 71% of patients, with remission in at least 54% of patients after 1 and 4 weeks when compared with waitlist control (106135). In a follow-up to this study, response and remission at 12 months occurred in 75% and 58% of patients, respectively (108643). However, all patients were given psilocybin, with the control group receiving treatment delayed by 8 weeks (106135, 108643).\n\nAvailable studies have used one or two doses of psilocybin 0.2-0.43 mg/kg, or psilocybin 10 mg and 25 mg given as single doses or 7 days apart. Many studies administered pure psilocybin 25 mg as a single dose. Also, in the available research, psilocybin was administered in conjunction with supportive or integrative psychotherapy administered by trained therapists (106129, 106131, 106132, 106133, 106134, 106135, 106138, 108643, 110400, 110788)(110791, 110792, 110793, 110796, 113864, 113865, 113866, 113867, 113868, 113869)(113871). The available research suggests that the most effective dose is between 0.3-0.43 mg/kg (106138, 106139). A dose-response meta-analysis of 4 controlled clinical trials in patients with major depressive disorders suggests that, while there may be a dose-response relationship, it is quite heterogenous and may plateau at 25 mg per 70 kg body weight (113866).\n\nMeta-analyses of only a small number of generally lower-quality studies suggest that taking psilocybin 0.3 mg/kg in conjunction with psychotherapy reduces suicidal ideation (106175) and that the reductions in anxiety and depression, as well as suicidal ideation, continue for up to 4.5 years (106145). However, suicidal ideation and self-injury were INCREASED in one randomized controlled trial (110400).\n\nIt is important to note that most of these studies provided controlled settings conducive to a positive emotional state, employed various safety measures, and offered social support via an experience guide or trained psychotherapists. Additionally, because the majority of studies combined psilocybin with psychotherapy, it is unclear if effects are due to psilocybin alone or the combination. Additionally, blinding can be limited when, or if, the psilocybin caused psychedelic side effects in study participants. Variations in dose, study durations, type of control condition, type and number of preparation and integration sessions in the accompanying supportive psychotherapy, differences in the background and training of the psychotherapists, severity of depression among study participants, and depression rating scales used across the different studies may have contributed to heterogeneity (113865).\n\nThere is limited information available on the use of micro doses of psilocybin for depression. Observational research suggests that psilocybin microdosing, alone or as part of 'stacking' with lion's mane mushroom and niacin, for one month is associated with a modest reduction in depression compared with baseline (110786). However, this study is limited by its retrospective design and lack of blinding.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for alcohol dependence.\nClinical research in adults with alcohol dependence and at least 4 heavy drinking days in the 30 days prior to enrollment shows that adding single doses of psilocybin at weeks 4 and 8 to a 12-week psychotherapy program reduces drinking when compared with taking diphenhydramine, although both groups experienced significant reductions. After 32 weeks of follow-up, the percentage of heavy drinking days and total drinking days in the psilocybin group was 10% and 29%, respectively, compared with 24% and 43%, respectively, in the diphenhydramine group. Treatments were provided in conjunction with 8 hours of direct therapist supervision; however, diphenhydramine was ineffective for maintaining subject or investigator blinding, limiting the validity of the study findings. Psilocybin was given in a weight-based dose of 25 mg per 70 kg at week 4 and 25-40 mg per 70 kg at week 8. Diphenhydramine was given as 50 mg at week 4 and 50-100 mg at week 8 (108939). In a previous proof-of-concept study conducted by the same research group, a similar group of patients receiving a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg psilocybin at week 4 and 0.4 mg/kg at week 8 experienced a decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days to 8%, compared to 35% at baseline (106137). It is unclear if psilocybin would have similar effects in those with more severe forms of alcohol use disorder.\nless\nAnorexia nervosa. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for treating anorexia nervosa.\nA small, open-label clinical study in adult females with anorexia nervosa shows that taking a single dose of a specific synthetic psilocybin (COMP360) 25 mg with psychological support improves body weight and body shape concerns, trait body image anxiety, and pre-occupations and rituals surrounding food, eating, and shape at 1-month follow-up when compared to baseline. However, significant improvements in body mass index (BMI) and measures of restraint and eating concerns were lacking. Effects were highly variable among the patients (113870). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for reducing anxiety.\nMost preliminary clinical research shows that taking psilocybin, usually in combination with psychotherapy, reduces symptoms of anxiety immediately post-treatment and for up to 6 months of follow-up when compared with either niacin placebo or low-dose psilocybin (106129, 106130, 106132, 106138, 106139). However, most of these studies did not specifically include patients with anxiety, but with depression, anxiety, and/or existential distress related to cancer. Available studies have used one or two doses of psilocybin 0.2-0.43 mg/kg (106129, 106132, 106138). The available research suggests that the most effective dose is between 0.3-0.43 mg/kg (106138, 106139, 113866). Meta-analyses of only three small and generally lower-quality studies suggest that taking psilocybin 0.3 mg/kg in conjunction with psychotherapy also reduces suicidal ideation in these patients (106175) and that the reductions in anxiety and depression, as well as suicidal ideation, continue for up to 4.5 years (106145).\n\nIt's important to note that these trials provided controlled settings conducive to a positive emotional state, employed various safety measures, and offered social support via an experience guide.\n\nThere is limited information available on the use of micro doses of psilocybin for anxiety. Observational research has found that psilocybin microdosing, alone or as part of 'stacking' with lion's mane mushroom and niacin, for one month is associated with a modest reduction in anxiety compared with baseline (110786). However, this study is limited by its retrospective design and lack of blinding.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this condition.\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for bipolar disorder.\nAlthough there is interest in using oral psilocybin for bipolar disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this condition. In addition, psilocybin may increase the risk of mania in patients with bipolar disorder or a family history of bipolar disorder. In one observational study, 9% to 14% of patients with bipolar disease reported new or increasing manic symptoms, as well as anxiety, depression, and difficulties sleeping. These symptoms, as well as hallucinations or delusions, resulted in the use of emergency services in 3.3% of patients (110790). Also, episodes of mania and depression have occurred in females with a family history of bipolar disorder after using magic mushrooms containing psilocybin (106184, 110798).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this condition.\nCluster headache. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for cluster headache.\nA small clinical trial in patients with cluster headaches shows that taking psilocybin 0.143 mg/kg three times approximately 5 days apart does not reduce the number of headache attacks over a 3-week period when compared with taking placebo (110797). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between treatments.\nless\nCognitive function. Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for improving cognitive function, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this use.\nDemoralization. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for demoralization.\nPreliminary clinical research in males with HIV/AIDS shows that taking a single dose of psilocybin 0.3 mg/kg or 0.36 mg/kg as part of a twice-weekly group therapy treatment program reduces feelings of demoralization when compared with baseline by a clinically meaningful amount. Approximately 33% of patients have a reduction of at least 50% in feelings of demoralization after 3 months (106162). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if this information is relevant to other populations with demoralization.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for reducing the frequency of migraines.\nIn patients with migraine headaches at least twice per week, a small, exploratory crossover trial shows that taking a single dose of psilocybin 0.143 mg/kg reduces the number of days with a migraine by 1.65 each week for 2 weeks, compared with a decrease of only 0.15 days per week with placebo. Also, 50% and 75% reductions in weekly migraine days occurred in 50% and 30% of patients taking psilocybin, respectively, compared with 20% and 0% of those taking placebo (106151). However, all subjects in this study received placebo first, followed by psilocybin 14 days later; the lack of randomization in relation to treatment sequence limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for OCD.\nA very small crossover trial in adults with OCD shows that taking single doses of psilocybin 25 mcg/kg, 100 mcg/kg, 200 mcg/kg, or 300 mcg/kg, separated by 1 week, results in similarly large reductions of overall OCD symptoms when compared with baseline. Symptom reduction of at least 50% lasted at least 24 hours in 67% of patients. All patients had experienced at least one previous treatment failure and were not permitted to take any other medications during the study period (106147). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for PTSD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this condition.\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if oral psilocybin, taken in micro doses, is beneficial for improving psychological well-being in healthy adults.\nA small clinical crossover study in adults without diagnosed mental health issues shows that micro dosing with 5-7 doses of approximately 1.5 mg of psilocybin over a 3-week period, with doses separated by at least 1 day, does not affect symptoms of depression or anxiety, emotional processing, or interoceptive awareness when compared with placebo (107486). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size of the study, selection bias, high rates of unblinding and drop-outs, and self-preparation of the micro doses.\nless\nQuality of life. Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for improving quality of life, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this use.\nSmoking cessation. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for smoking cessation.\nOne small uncontrolled clinical trial in 15 nicotine-dependent smokers shows that taking psilocybin 0.29 mg/kg once, followed by a dose of 0.43 mg/kg 2 weeks later, with an optional 3rd dose 6 weeks later, as part of a smoking cessation cognitive behavioral therapy program, results in abstinence in 80% of participants after a follow-up of 6 months. Abstinence was based on self-reports and biomarkers (106142) and was maintained in 67% of participants at 12 months and 60% of participants at a mean of 30 months (106136). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nStress. Although there is interest in using oral psilocybin for reducing stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of psilocybin for this use.\nBody dysmorphic disorder. It is unclear if oral psilocybin is beneficial for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patents with unresponsive moderate to severe symptoms of BDD shows that taking a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg has a large effect on symptoms of body obsession when compared with baseline. Benefits were evident after one week, with 58% of patients having at least a 30% decrease in symptoms, and 33% of patients in remission, 12 weeks after treatment (110800). This trial provided a controlled setting conducive to a positive emotional state, employed various safety measures, and offered social support via an experience guide.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate psilocybin for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nMost cases of toxicity associated with psilocybin have occurred with the use of Psilocybe mushrooms. It is unclear if these events are due to psilocybin, other constituents, or the combination, and the actual psilocybin content of the mushrooms is often unknown. In one case report, seizures and myocardial infarction occurred in an 18-year-old male after consuming an unknown amount of Psilocybe semilanceata (106183). There have been at least two cases of rhabdomyolysis following the use of mushrooms containing psilocybin (106181, 110795). In one case, a 25-year-old male presented with severe rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney failure, and posterior encephalopathy following use of an unknown quantity of Psilocybe cubensis (106181). In an 18-year-old male, rhabdomyolysis was secondary to severe psychosis and aggression (110795).\n\nRarely, a post-traumatic flashback has occurred after psilocybin use, resulting in nausea, tinnitus, panic, and insomnia (106162). In one case report, intake of a large amount of Psilocybe semilanceata also resulted in a post-traumatic flashback (106182). Other individuals have experienced severe mania, depression, and/or anxiety which lasted days to months after using psilocybin (106156, 106162).\nTreatment\nIn one case report, a 21-year old male was treated with intravenous physostigmine after consumption of 30 mushrooms positively identified as Psilocybe semilanceata containing an unknown quantity of psilocybin (106182). A 25-year-old male required respiratory support, corticosteroids, and anticonvulsant therapy after consumption of an unknown quantity of Psilocybe cubensis. The patient's drug screen was positive for opiates, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), benzodiazepines, and methadone (106181). An 18-year-old male who developed severe psychosis and aggression resulting in rhabdomyolysis after taking psilocybin-containing mushrooms required oral and intravenous antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and sedatives, as well as admission to the psychiatry unit. After several weeks, he was discharged following adequate symptom relief with olanzapine 5 mg in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime, divalproex sodium 500 mg twice daily, and lithium extended release 450 mg twice daily (110795). A 32-year-old-female with a history of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder with mania and severe depression lasting several months after intake of mushrooms containing psilocybin was treated unsuccessfully with a variety of psychopharmacological agents and alternative and dietary interventions before experiencing some relief with pramipexole titrated up to 4.5 mg daily (110798).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nMost psilocybin is dephosphorylated to psilocin by gastric and intestinal mucosa enzymes. Some psilocin is metabolized by intestinal mucosa enzymes to psilocin-O-glucuronide. Thus, most psilocybin is absorbed as psilocin and some as psilocin-O-glucuronide (106165). Psilocin is detectable in the plasma within 30-50 minutes, with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1-2 hours after intake (106143, 106165, 106168, 106170, 106173, 110789). In one study, the onset of action after ingestion of psilocybin 15 mg or 30 mg occurred at 0.8 hours, with peak effect occurring at about 2 hours and duration of effect lasting about 6-7 hours (108649).\nDistribution\nFollowing carbon-14-labelled psilocybin intake, 50% is rapidly and systemically distributed (106143).\nMetabolism\nIn the liver, psilocybin is dephosphorylated to psilocin. Psilocin is metabolized to psilocin-O-glucuronide by uridine 5-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 (106165). A small amount of psilocin is metabolized by monoamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde (4-HIA), 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (4-HIAA), and 4-hydroxytryptophole (106165).\nExcretion\nPsilocin has a half-life of 3-5 hours in plasma (106146, 106165, 108649). Psilocin is mainly excreted in urine as 4-HIAA and psilocin glucuronide, with peak urine levels occurring about 2-4 hours after consumption (106146, 106178, 110789).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPsilocybin is a constituent of mushrooms in the Psilocybe genus, including Psilocybe bohemica, Psilocybe cubensis, Psilocybe mexicana, and Psilocybe semilanceata, as well as other \"magic mushrooms\" such as Gymnophilus purpuratus, Inocybe aeruginascens, and Panaeolus cyanescens (106143, 106146, 106183). Psilocybin may make up 0.37% to 1.3% of the dry mushroom (106160, 106183). Psilocybin content in cultivated or street samples of mushrooms may vary by a factor of 4 or 10, respectively (106143). Psilocybin is a prodrug that is metabolized to psilocin, a hallucinogenic tryptamine and an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors (108939).\nAnti-addiction effects\nPsilocybin is of interest for the treatment of various forms of addiction (106144). However, in an animal model of alcohol relapse, there was no long-lasting anti-relapse effect of psilocybin when given five times every 12 hours as a moderate dose, twice as a high dose seven days apart, or as part of a twice weekly micro dosing schedule for four weeks (106164). One study of patients with nicotine dependence suggests that the quality of the psilocybin-related subjective mystical experience may be associated with a higher likelihood of tobacco abstinence 6 months later (106144).\nAnti-migraine effects\nPsilocybin is of interest in the treatment of migraine. Acute use of psilocybin has been shown to reduce the number and severity of migraines in human research (106151). The mechanism of action is not clear. However, it does not seem to be related to psychotropic activity, suggesting a possible therapeutic role of doses below those required for psychotropic behavioral changes (106151).\nNeurological effects\nAt least some effects of psilocybin seem to be related to its serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist activity. However, 5-HT2A receptor-independent mechanisms are also thought to be involved (106168, 106169, 106171, 106176). In humans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows that psilocybin-increased functional connectivity in sensory regions of the brain is associated with activation of both the 5-HT2A and 1A receptor systems. These activities may play a role in the psychedelic activity of psilocybin (106148). Psilocybin has little affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (106143, 106171).\n\nIt is unclear how the acute effects of psilocybin may precipitate long-term antidepressant benefits. One proposed mechanism of action is an acute destabilization of brain networks resulting in a persistent alteration in activity (106143). In an animal model, the restoration of synaptic strength in some brain circuits was thought to contribute to the antidepressant effects of psilocybin, independent of 5-HT2A receptor effects (106169). Other research suggests that psilocybin increases functional connectivity/global network integration and cognitive and neural flexibility (106153, 108650, 108645). One such study shows that a single large dose of psilocybin increases functional connectivity strength across the brain that persists for at least one month, suggesting an increase in brain plasticity. This was associated with enduring positive feelings, including joy, pride, and amusement (106153). In human research, psilocybin increases emotional empathy and prosocial behaviors (106149, 106150, 106163). In a small clinical study in healthy adults, pretreatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor did not attenuate the positive mood effects of psilocybin (108644).\n\nSome research also suggests that psilocybin might aid in the reconnection of emotions. Research shows that psilocybin results in a post-treatment decrease in cerebral blood flow in the amygdala and other parts of the temporal cortex (106133). In humans with treatment-resistant depression, psilocybin was found to improve the processing of emotional facial expressions, which correlated with a reduction in the inability to feel pleasure. There were also increases in responses to exposure to emotional faces from the amygdala, but responses to negative stimuli were decreased (106140, 106153, 106176, 106177). Some evidence suggests that the overall quality of the psilocybin-related psychedelic or \"mystical\" or \"spiritual\" experience may predict long-term antidepressant effects or changes in feelings of well-being (106131, 106170, 106172, 106174). However, animal research shows that altered perception may not be required for antidepressant effects (106169). In animal research, micro dosing with psilocybin, or using doses below the threshold for psychotropic behavioral changes, has shown antidepressant effects and improved cognitive function (106168).\n\nShortened time to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with depression. Use of daytime psilocybin has been shown to prolong REM sleep latency. However, there were no effects on other measures of sleep, including total sleep time or sleep efficiency (106158).\n\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that psilocybin 30 mg produces comparable subjective effects as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 100 and 200 mcg (108649)."

    "Pu-erh Tea": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Pu-erh tea is produced mainly in the Yunnan district in the southwestern part of China. It has also gained popularity in Taiwan (15468). Pu-erh tea is made by parching and then fermenting the leaves of Camellia sinsensis. These leaves are also used to make green tea, black tea, and oolong tea; however, the production method differs for each type of tea (102759).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Pu-erh tea has not been associated with significant adverse effects (15465). Pu-erh tea extract has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 1 gram daily for 12 weeks (102759). Pu-erh tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 4 cups of tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when consumed as a beverage in large quantities. Pu-erh tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg daily, or approximately 6 cups of tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances (11832). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated pu-erh tea.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages in children and adolescents (11833). Intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily is not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents (11733, 98806).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of pu-erh tea, intake should be closely monitored during pregnancy to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). Use of caffeine in pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 98806). In some studies, consuming caffeine in amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014, 37960). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant adults can safely consume caffeine doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine found in about 3 cups of tea (2708).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from pu-erh tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of tea. High intake of caffeine throughout pregnancy has resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711). In a study that included 2 large cohorts of mother/infant pairs, the first cohort with a median maternal plasma caffeine level of 168.5 ng/mL (range 29.5-650.5 ng/mL) during pregnancy, suggests birth weights and lengths were lower in the 4th quartile of caffeine intake compared with the 1st. By age 7, heights and weights were lower by 1.5 cm and 1.1 kg respectively. In the second cohort of mother/infant pairs with higher maternal pregnancy plasma caffeine levels, median 625.5 ng/mL (range 86.2 to 1994.7 ng/mL), heights at age 8 were 2.2 cm lower, but there was no difference in weights (109846).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of pu-erh tea, caffeine intake should be closely monitored. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations and caffeine peaks in milk approximately 1-2 hours after consumption (23590).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of pu-erh tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants (6026). Large doses or excessive intake of pu-erh tea should be avoided during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, pu-erh tea is well tolerated when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Many of the adverse effects of pu-erh tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as diuresis, gastric irritation, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, restlessness, tachycardia, tachypnea, tremors, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Many of the severe adverse effects of pu-erh tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as arrhythmia, chest pain, convulsions, delirium, premature heartbeat, and respiratory alkalosis. Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis.\nCardiovascular\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Although acute consumption of caffeine can cause increased blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722). Epidemiological research suggests there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension. Some evidence suggests chronic consumption of pu-erh tea may reduce the risk of hypertension (12518).\n\nEpidemiological research has found that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg daily, or approximately 4 cups of tea, is not associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453), and cardiovascular disease in general (37805, 98806).\nless\nEndocrine\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Some evidence has found that caffeine is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in those with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nIn infants, tea may cause microcytic anemia (631).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea may cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation in infants (6023).\nless\nImmunologic\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Caffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Some epidemiological research has found that caffeine may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, but conflicting evidence exists. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake of less than 400 mg daily, or about 4 cups of tea, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317, 98806).\n\nSome researchers believe that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as muscle tension and muscle pains. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Orally, caffeine can cause insomnia, nervousness, headache, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, restlessness, ringing in the ears, tremors, delirium, and convulsions (10755, 11832, 11838, 13735). Caffeine may also exacerbate sleep disturbances in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10204).\n\nThere is some concern that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as headache, tiredness and fatigue, decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness, drowsiness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, and irritability (13738). Other symptoms such as delirium, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Caffeine may cause tachypnea-induced respiratory alkalosis (11832, 11838, 13735). Some researchers think that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as runny nose. However, this symptom may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless",

In animals, danshen slows the clearance of caffeine by inhibiting cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (23580).\nless\nECHINACEA\nTheoretically, echinacea might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. In healthy individuals, taking echinacea 400 mg daily for 8 days seems to inhibit the oral clearance of caffeine (23581). This effect seems to be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nEPHEDRA (Ma Huang)\nConcomitant use increases the risk for adverse stimulant effects.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedra with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death (6486, 9740, 10307). Tell patients to avoid taking pu-erh tea with ephedra and other stimulants.\nless\nFOLIC ACID\nConcomitant use may reduce activity and bioavailability of supplemental folic acid.\nPu-erh tea appears to reduce the bioavailability of folate in humans (53782).\nless\nGENISTEIN-CONTAINING HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Taking genistein 1 gram daily for 14 days seems to inhibit caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy females (23582). This effect has been attributed to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nIRON\nTheoretically, concomitant use might reduce the absorption of non-heme iron from supplements.\nPu-erh tea appears to reduce absorption of non-heme iron from foods (8904, 24980). Infants given tea to drink have an increased risk of microcytic anemia (631). However, a study of iron-deficient elderly patients suggests that concomitant use doesn't alter iron absorption in this population. Theoretically, pu-erh tea might reduce the absorption of iron supplements. For most patients, this effect will not be clinically significant. Advise patients with iron deficiency to consume tea between meals rather than with meals to lessen this interaction (8904).\nless\nKUDZU\nTheoretically, kudzu might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Kudzu inhibits caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy male individuals (23583). This effect has been attributed to inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nMAGNESIUM\nTheoretically, pu-erh tea may increase magnesium loss.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Consuming large amounts of caffeine can increase urinary excretion of magnesium (11939).\nless\nMELATONIN\nTheoretically, concomitant use may increase the risk for melatonin-related adverse effects.\nPu-erh tea contains caffeine. Co-administration of caffeine and melatonin can increase melatonin levels by about 142%; this effect is more pronounced in nonsmoking individuals (23584). Also, when taken in the evening, caffeine can increase endogenous melatonin levels in healthy individuals (23585).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANXIETY DISORDERS\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea might aggravate anxiety disorders, especially when used in doses of more than 400 mg, or approximately 4 cups of tea, daily (11743, 98806). Use with caution.\nless\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might increase the risk of bleeding. Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029, 36425); however, this interaction has not been reported in humans (1701). Caffeine can prolong bleeding time and increase the results of a bleeding time test (1701). Use with caution.\nless\nCARDIAC CONDITIONS\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea can induce cardiac arrhythmias in sensitive individuals. Caffeine has been reported to both increase and decrease heart rate, although this is not thought to be clinically significant at doses below 400 mg, or approximately 4 cups of tea, daily (11845, 98806). Use with caution.\nless\nDIABETES\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea may cause increases or decreases in blood glucose; use with caution. Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646). Some evidence in healthy individuals suggests that drinking black tea, a similar tea, reduces blood glucose levels (92403). Other research suggests that caffeine may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages, such as pu-erh tea, has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine may also enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in people with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might worsen diarrhea. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, can exacerbate diarrhea (10023).\nless\nEPILEPSY\nPatients with epilepsy should avoid using high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing supplements; low doses should be used with caution. Pu-erh tea contains caffeine. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563). However, caffeine does not seem to affect the anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine, tiagabine, or oxcarbazepine (23561).\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might worsen glaucoma. Caffeine increases intraocular pressure. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and persists for at least 90 minutes (8540).\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea might increase blood pressure. Caffeine might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this doesn't seem to occur in people who consume tea or other caffeinated products regularly (1451, 1452, 2722, 15655, 36468, 36515, 36539, 36556). Short-term caffeine consumption can temporarily increase blood pressure. Usually, increases in blood pressure occur 30 minutes after ingestion, peak in 1-2 hours, and may last for over 4 hours (36539, 37732, 37989, 38000, 38300). Chronic caffeine consumption does not appear to increase the risk of developing chronic hypertension (38190).\nless\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might worsen symptoms of IBS. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, can exacerbate diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS (100526).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might worsen osteoporosis. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium. Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg daily, unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intake equivalent to approximately 4 cups of tea (11733, 98806). Postmenopausal adults with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine (2669).\nless\nPARKINSON DISEASE\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might worsen symptoms of Parkinson disease. The combination of caffeine and creatine should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease. Intake of caffeine of more than 300 mg daily in conjunction with creatine 10 grams daily might worsen the progression of Parkinson disease (95951).\nless\nSCHIZOPHRENIA\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might exacerbate psychosis in schizophrenia. Use with caution. In a case report, a schizophrenic patient stable on biweekly flupenthixol decanoate 40 mg injections experienced paranoia, agitation, and delusion after beginning to consume 4 cans of coffee daily (600 mg daily caffeine or 8.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks (91066). Symptoms of psychosis resolved after discontinuation of coffee.\nless",

Caffeine attenuates the characteristic cardiovascular responses to dipyridamole and has altered test results (11742).\nless\nFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (fMRI)\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might interfere with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests. Caffeine can increase the linearity of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that is used in most fMRI studies (23587).\nless\nNEUROBLASTOMA TESTS\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might cause false-positive diagnosis of neuroblastoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might interfere with pharmacological stress tests. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors (11771, 37784). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772). Additionally, clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg and 400 mg given 90 minutes before stress testing, significantly impairs the ability of regadenoson, an adenosine receptor agonist, to detect existing ischemia (91083).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nTheoretically, the caffeine in pu-erh tea might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea might interfere with pulmonary function test results. Forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) seems to show a small improvement up to 2 hours after caffeine use. Mid-expiratory flow rates may also improve with caffeine for up to 4 hours (9607).\nless\nURATE\nThe caffeine in pu-erh tea might falsely increase serum urate test results determined by the Bittner method. Caffeine causes false elevations in serum urate test results determined by the Bittner method (15).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of pu-erh tea.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of pu-erh tea are the leaf and stem. Although pu-erh, green, oolong, and black teas are products of the same plant, they differ in methods of processing after harvest. Green tea undergoes limited oxidation, oolong tea is partially oxidized, and black tea is fully oxidized. The post-harvest processing of pu-erh tea involves limited oxidation, similar to green tea. However, unlike green tea, the pu-erh tea is then fermented with various microorganisms and undergoes prolonged storage under high humidity. Pu-erh tea that is processed for a longer period of time is considered to have better taste quality. This method of processing makes pu-erh tea susceptible to uncontrolled microbial growth with organisms such as Aspergillus niger, which makes the tea musty (15464, 102759).\n\nLike other teas made from Camellia sinensis, pu-erh tea contains caffeine, catechins, gallic acid, theophylline, and tannins (15464, 15468, 15469). Pu-erh tea also contains theabrownin (102760). Concentrations of these constituents are influenced by the temperature of the water used for steeping and the length of time steeping (15463, 15465). Pu-erh tea contains less caffeine than other teas (15463).\nAntidiabetes effects\nThere is interest in using pu-erh tea to prevent or treat diabetes. Animal research in mice fed a high-fat diet shows that taking raw or ripened pu-erh tea extract 300-600 mg/kg orally daily for 15 weeks improves glucose tolerance when compared with control (108656).\nAntioxidant effects\nPu-erh tea also seems to have antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. Constituents such as epicatechin, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and polyphenols may contribute to this effect (15465, 15466).\nCardiovascular effects\nUnlike other teas, pu-erh tea contains small amounts of lovastatin, which may be a by-product of its bacterial content (15468). Animal research shows that pu-erh tea can lower triglycerides and total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with control. However, animal research shows conflicting effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (15464, 15467, 102760, 102761, 108656). Research in humans has yielded mixed results with respect to reductions in LDL cholesterol (102759, 102760).\n\nAnimal research suggests that any hypocholesterolemic benefit of pu-erh tea might be related to the alteration of the gut microbiome by the constituent theabrownin and an increased excretion and decreased synthesis of cholesterol (102760, 108656). Animal research also suggests that pu-erh tea prevents a high-fat diet-induced elevation in fasting glucose levels or changes in insulin sensitivity, as well as alterations in the serum fatty acid profile (102761, 108656).\nHepatic effects\nPu-erh tea is sometimes used to reduce fatty liver. In animal research, pu-erh tea prevented a high-fat diet-induced increase in the size and number of liver lipid droplets (102761).\nWeight effects\nThere is interest in using pu-erh tea for obesity. Animal research in mice fed a high-fat diet shows that taking raw or ripened pu-erh tea extract 300-600 mg/kg orally daily for 15 weeks reduces body weight and visceral fat mass when compared with control (108656)."

This adverse effect was attributed to a high concentration of cucurbitacin, which is commonly found in wild pumpkins (104535).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, pumpkin seed oil has been reported to cause mild abdominal discomfort in clinical trials (5093, 92378). There are also two case reports of adults developing severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea following consumption of a meal containing either bitter-tasting pumpkin or undefined squash. These adverse effects were attributed to a high concentration of cucurbitacin, which is commonly found in wild pumpkins (104535).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, pumpkin seed oil and pumpkin pulp have been reported to cause anaphylactic reactions in children and adults. A case review highlights 4 cases of anaphylaxis in children (3 from pumpkin pulp, 1 from pumpkin seeds), and 7 cases in adults (1 from pumpkin flesh, 6 from pumpkin seeds). Symptoms of anaphylaxis include urticaria, angioedema of the lips or face, dyspnea, dysphagia, and oropharyngeal itching and swelling. A case report describes a 2-year-old male presenting with urticaria, swollen lips, and increased dyspnea 10 minutes after ingesting pumpkin seeds.

Taking oral pumpkin seed or pumpkin seed oil may improve symptoms of BPH.\nOne study in patients with BPH shows that taking pumpkin seed 5 grams twice daily for 12 months may be more effective for controlling symptoms than pumpkin seed extract 1000 mg twice daily (92383). A specific pumpkin seed extract (Prosta Pink Forte) 1-2 capsules daily for 12 weeks has also been used (11231). Some preliminary clinical research also suggests that taking pumpkin seed oil (Prostafit, EuRho Vital) two tablets daily for 6 months may be as effective as the medication prazosin (92382). Pumpkin seed oil has also been compared with tamsulosin. A clinical study comparing pumpkin seed oil 360 mg twice daily to tamsulosin 0.4 mg once nightly for 3 months shows that both treatment groups report improvements in BPH symptoms and quality of life when compared with baseline, although improvement appears greater in the tamsulosin group, specifically when measured at 1 month and 3 months. In the pumpkin seed oil group, adverse effects were reported in 0% of patients, compared with 15% of patients taking tamsulosin (107842).

Pumpkin seeds can contain as much as 50% fatty oil, 38% protein, and 37% carbohydrates, depending on the growing and processing conditions (8257, 92382). Pumpkin seeds are also rich in cucurbitin and carotenoids, including lutein, carotene, and beta-carotene (515). The seed oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including 47% linoleic acid, 29% oleic acid, 14% palmitic acid, and 8% stearic acid (8257). The oil is also rich in vitamin E, including both gamma-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherol (3 mg/100 grams) (8257). The enzyme acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX) is present in the pumpkin seed. This enzyme catalyzes fatty acid oxidation, specifically the oxidation of fatty acid CoA esters with 4 to 10 carbon atoms (8256). Pumpkin seeds also contain delta-5- and delta-7-sterols (92383).\nAnthelmintic effects\nCucurbitin, a constituent in pumpkin seeds, has anthelmintic effects. The concentration of cucurbitin varies significantly among pumpkin species (515).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that pumpkin seed extract or cucurbitin can inhibit the growth of various types of cancer cells. The growth inhibition does not appear to be related to steroid hormone receptor activation (92380).\nDiuretic effects\nPumpkin seed oil appears to exhibit a diuretic effect, which can relieve bladder discomfort, causing the perception of reduced prostate gland swelling without reducing the gland size. The phytosterol constituents are also believed to affect urine flow (515). Delta-7 sterols, thought to be mainly responsible for these effects, are detected only in certain strains of pumpkin (92383).\nProstate effects\nAnimal research suggests that pumpkin seed and seed oil might improve bladder and urethral function, reduce prostate weight, and have anti-inflammatory effects, which might help BPH symptoms (11233, 92383)."

            "Effectiveness": "LIKELY EFFECTIVE\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most clinical research shows that taking oral pygeum reduces the frequency and severity of BPH symptoms in adults. However, it is unclear how pygeum compares with the standard prescription medications.\nMeta-analyses of randomized clinical trials show that adults with BPH who take oral pygeum 75-200 mg daily for 60-90 days are about twice as likely to have improvement in BPH symptoms as those taking placebo. Taking pygeum also increases peak urine flow by 23% and reduces residual urine volume by 24% in patients with BPH (10425, 10426). Preliminary clinical research also shows that once daily dosing is as effective as twice daily dosing (6368).\n\nPygeum has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small study shows that taking a specific combination product (ProstateEZE Max, Caruso's Natural Health) containing pygeum, pumpkin seed oil, Epilobium parviflorum, lycopene, and saw palmetto as 1 capsule daily for 3 months decreases daytime urinary frequency by an additional 16% and nighttime urinary frequency by an additional 32% when compared with placebo (92164). In another clinical trial, taking a combination of pygeum and stinging nettle for 6 months did not improve BPH symptoms when compared with placebo; however, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (70219).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of pygeum is the bark, although leaf extracts are also of interest. Pygeum bark contains a variety of constituents, including sterols such as beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosterone, and campesterol, ferulic acid esters such as N-docosanol and N-tetracosanol, triterpines such as oleanic acid, crateagolic acid, and ursolic acid, terpenic acids, aliphatic alcohols, and acidic phenols including atraric acid and chlorogenic acid (70215, 70225, 70238, 112146). It also contains quercetin and catechin. Pygeum leaf extract contains quercetin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, oleic acid, octadecanoic acid, luteolin, apigenin, beta-sitosterol, prunetrin, and ursolic acid (112146).\nAlzheimer disease effects\nAnimal research shows that both pygeum leaf extract and pygeum stem bark extract inhibit cholinesterase activity in brain tissue and attenuate memory decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Depending on the dose, anti-cholinesterase activity seems to be higher with pygeum stem bark extract when compared with the leaf extract. (112146).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that pygeum decreases production of leukotrienes and other 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, which suggests possible anti-inflammatory activity (6769, 10425, 10426, 70231, 70239). In vitro, pygeum appears to inhibit fibroblast proliferation induced by epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor type I, and basic fibroblast growth factor (4301).\nAntiandrogenic effects\nIn vitro research shows that atraric acid, a constituent of pygeum, has antiandrogenic activity via inhibition of the ligand-induced transactivation of the human androgen receptor and ligand-induced nuclear localization. Glucocorticoid or progesterone receptors are not inhibited by atraric acid (70225). Other in vitro research shows that a selective dichloromethane extract from pygeum has antiandrogenic effects. Bioactivity-directed fractionation of this extract led to the isolation of N-butylbenzenesulfonamide (NBBS) (70220).\nAnticancer effects\nThe anticancer potential of pygeum has been demonstrated in both in vitro (PC-3 and LNCaP cells) and in vivo (TRAMP mouse model). In vitro, ethanolic extracts of pygeum inhibited the growth of cancer cell lines through induction of apoptosis, interference with cellular kinetics, and down regulation of ERalpa and PKC-alpha proteins. In animals, pygeum showed a significant reduction in prostate cancer incidence (35%) compared to casein-fed mice (62.5%) (70222). There is evidence that pygeum extracts have antiproliferative effects on prostatic fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Pygeum might inhibit growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which might inhibit prostate growth and cellular hyperplasia (4301, 6769).\nEstrogenic effects\nPygeum contains phytoestrogens, some of which are similar in structure to estradiol. Preliminary animal research shows that pygeum extract increases uterus weight of ovariectomized and adrenalectomized mice, suggesting that pygeum has estrogenic activity (70233).\nGenitourinary effects\nMultiple mechanisms have been proposed for the genitourinary effects of pygeum, including 5-alpha reductase inhibition, modulation of bladder contractility, decreased leukotriene production, enhanced estrogenic effects, inhibition of fibroblast production, and anti-inflammatory properties (10425, 10426). Pygeum extract appears to inhibit human prostatic 5-alpha reductase, but much less powerfully than finasteride (70232). Reduction of urethral obstruction and improvement of bladder function have been observed (6769). Most studies of pygeum extract have addressed outcomes related to the obstructive component. In rats, pygeum inhibits dihydrotestosterone-induced prostate hyperplasia via a mechanism that appears unrelated to androgen receptor blockade (70232). In rats and humans, pygeum extract has been shown to stimulate secretory activity of the prostate and seminal vesicles (70236). Reduction of contractile dysfunction of the bladder caused by partial outlet obstruction has been observed with pretreatment of rabbits with pygeum extract 1-100 mg/kg daily (70235)."

However, a small clinical trial in overweight females shows that taking pyruvate 5 grams twice daily for 30 days while participating in a supervised exercise program does not reduce body weight when compared with placebo (13660).

Another small clinical study in American football players shows that taking pyruvate 0.22 grams/kg daily for 5 weeks does not improve jump height or peak cycling power when compared with placebo (13661).

However, two very small clinical studies in untrained males show that consuming high-dose dihydroxyacetone plus pyruvate 25 grams daily for one week increases arm and leg exercise endurance when compared with placebo (807, 808). It is unclear if these findings are due to pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, or the combination.\nless\nAtrophic acne scars. It is unclear if application of a topical pyruvic acid skin peel improves atrophic acne scars.Details: A small clinical study in adults with atrophic acne scars treated with microneedling shows that applying a pyruvic acid 25% peel once modestly improves acne scarring and patient- and physician-reported scores at 21 weeks when compared to baseline but not when compared with a trichloroacetic acid 15% peel (112174). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the short duration of follow-up, as certain scars may need an extended time for improvement.\nAtrophic acne scars.

The interpretation of these findings is limited by the short duration of follow-up, as certain scars may need an extended time for improvement.\nless\nCataracts. Although there has been interest in using oral pyruvate for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of pyruvate for this purpose.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if inhaled sodium pyruvate is beneficial in patients with COPD.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate to severe COPD shows that inhaling nebulized sodium pyruvate 275 mcg three times daily for 6 weeks may improve lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), by up to 11% when compared with placebo (70278).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous pyruvate may improve measures of cardiac function in patients with CHF. Oral pyruvate has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nTwo very small, open-label clinical studies in patients with CHF show that infusing pyruvate 150-300 mmol/L into the left main coronary artery (for a total dose of 27-41.6 mmol pyruvate) may increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), increase cardiac index by 23%, increase stroke-volume index by 38%, and decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 36% when compared to baseline (70253, 70262). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral pyruvate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with open-angle glaucoma and optic neuropathy shows that taking pyruvate and niacinamide, titrated to 3 grams of each, daily for 3 weeks increases the odds of pointwise improvement in visual function by 3.2-fold when compared with placebo. However, global visual field index and retinal nerve fiber thickness were not improved (107708).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral pyruvate is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA small clinical study in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that supplementing a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet with pyruvate 36-53 grams daily in three divided doses for 6 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 4% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5% when compared with placebo (70259).\nless\nIchthyosis. It is unclear if topical pyruvate is beneficial in patients with ichthyosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with different types of ichthyosis shows that applying a Eucerin skin cream containing pyruvate 5% daily for at least 2 weeks increases shedding of scaly skin when compared with Eucerin alone (70285).\nless\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if a topical pyruvic acid skin peel is beneficial in patients with wrinkled skin.\nA small clinical study in patients with photodamaged facial skin shows that applying a pyruvic acid 50% skin peel once weekly for 4 weeks smooths skin, decreases fine wrinkles, and decreases hyperpigmentation when compared to baseline (12020). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate pyruvate for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nPyruvate has most often been used in doses ranging from 6-40 grams daily, taken in divided doses, for up to 6 weeks.

            "Interactions with Supplements": "None known.",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with pyruvate.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, topical application of sodium pyruvate into the aqueous humor increased the level of pyruvate in the aqueous sample of the eye (70280).\nMetabolism\nPyruvate may undergo aerobic or anaerobic metabolism, with anaerobic metabolism producing lactate (108892, 108893). Aerobic metabolism to acetyl-CoA results in fatty acid production, and metabolism to oxaloacetate results in gluconeogenesis to carbohydrates and replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates (92512).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nPyruvate is a three-carbon organic acid (alpha-ketocarboxylic acid), formed in the body from glycolysis, a metabolic process that converts glucose to pyruvate. This anaerobic process takes place in the cytosol, releasing energy to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Pyruvate may further undergo aerobic or anaerobic metabolism, with anaerobic metabolism producing lactate (108892, 108893). Aerobic metabolism to acetyl-CoA results in fatty acid production, and metabolism to oxaloacetate results in gluconeogenesis to carbohydrates and replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates (92512).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that ethyl pyruvate and sodium pyruvate provided protection against proinflammatory cytokines (70260). The potential anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl pyruvate have been reviewed by Fink, particularly with respect to suppression of NF-kappaB activation, secretion of nitric oxide, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines (70263, 70273, 70271, 70270).\nAnti-tumor effects\nAnimal research suggests that a liquid diet supplemented with pyruvate may inhibit tumor growth (806).\nCardioprotective effects\nIn human research, pyruvate increased contraction force, half-time to relaxation, and action potential duration in human myocardium in patients undergoing open heart surgery (70264). In animal research, the cardioprotective effects of pyruvate were suggested to be due to limitation of free radical activity (2488). In arrested swine flu hearts, in situ, the addition of pyruvate to cardioplegia solution resulted in a reduction in 8-isoprostane release during arrest and reperfusion, maintenance of the glutathione redox state, reactivation of creatine kinase and aconitase, and doubling the PCr phosphorylation potential [PCr]/([Cr][P(i)]) after reperfusion (70265, 70268). In guinea pig hearts, pyruvate restored contractile performance, increased GSH/GSSG, and maintained phosphocreatine phosphorylation state (70258). In beagles, pyruvate temporarily increased phosphocreatine phosphorylation and GSH/GSSG during open-chest cardiac compression and during recovery; pressure development, dP/dt, and carotid flow were also enhanced during recovery (70267). Sharma investigated the effect of pyruvate in this animal model in a separate study (70269). Further information on this study is lacking.\n\nThe potential cardioprotective effects of pyruvate were reviewed by Mallet, particularly with respect to enhancement of sarcoplasmic reticular calcium transport and antioxidant properties (70266).\nDermatologic effects\nWhen applied topically in a clinical trial, pyruvate may help exfoliate the surface layers of skin (12020).\nGlucose metabolism effects\nIn an obese rat model, calcium pyruvate and pyruvylglycine had did not have an effect on glucose tolerance and commonly observed decreased insulin response (2487).\nOcular effects\nIn animal and in vitro studies, the effects of ethyl pyruvate on ocular inflammation has been examined (70282). In rats, it was found that ethyl pyruvate prevented endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU)-induced increases in infiltrating cells and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, in human primary non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPECs), ethyl pyruvate was found to inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF-?B and expression of Cox-2, iNOS and TNF-a. The authors concluded that ethyl pyruvate may be a treatment for ocular inflammation such as uveitis. In animal research, attenuation of sugar cataract formation by topical administration of ethyl pyruvate has been described (70254). In rat cataracts induced by a 30% galactose diet, eye drops containing 5% ethyl pyruvate were shown to decelerate the process of cataract formation. The authors concluded this was attributable to pyruvate's'inhibitory effects on dulcitol synthesis and protein glycation, and suggested that esterified pyruvate is preferable due to its greater penetration through the cornea, as compared to unesterified pyruvate.\nWeight loss effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests pyruvate may increase fat oxidation (2472). Animals that consumed a diet containing calcium pyruvate or pyruvylglycine gained significantly less weight, had a lower food-conversion efficiency, maintained a higher resting oxygen consumption, had increased lipid oxidation, and decreased carbohydrate oxidation (2487)."
