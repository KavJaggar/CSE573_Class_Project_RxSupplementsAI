            "Overview": "Zeaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid. It is found along with its isomer lutein in the human macula and retina (3225, 60245). Zeaxanthin consists of three stereoisomers, zeaxanthin itself (3R,3'R), meso-zeaxanthin (3R,3'S), and less commonly (3S, 3'S)-zeaxanthin (106373). Zeaxanthin is found in high levels in foods such as egg yolk, oranges, grapes, goji, mango, honeydew melon, corn, orange pepper, and spirulina (3224, 60091, 106357, 106360). Shrimp is a source of meso-zeaxanthin (106373).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in doses of up to 2 mg daily. Zeaxanthin supplements have been safely used in clinical trials at doses of up to 2 mg daily for up to 10 years (94701, 94702, 94703, 108615).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts greater than 2 mg daily. Zeaxanthin supplements in doses of 8-10 mg daily for up to 12 months have been used with apparent safety in clinical trials (60175, 60245).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A specific product containing zeaxanthin (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) has been used with apparent safety in infants at a dose of 0.0006 mg daily for 36 weeks (91163). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of zeaxanthin at higher doses or in older children.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts found in foods. Zeaxanthin is found in breast milk and levels correlate with infant status (106365). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of supplemental zeaxanthin.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, dietary and supplemental zeaxanthin are generally well tolerated. No adverse effects have been reported in clinical research.",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral zeaxanthin, when used in low levels as part of multi-ingredient products containing lutein, seems to improve some aspects of vision in patient with AMD. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin alone or in amounts similar to lutein is beneficial for slowing AMD progression.\nEpidemiological research has found that people who consume higher amounts of zeaxanthin plus lutein in the diet have a reduced risk of developing late AMD, but not early or intermediate AMD (60238, 106353, 106359). However, any association between intake of zeaxanthin itself and the development of AMD is not clear. Some clinical research has assessed whether zeaxanthin alone can reduce symptoms and progression of AMD. A small clinical trial shows that taking supplemental zeaxanthin 8 mg daily for 12 months modestly improves some aspects of vision, such as macular pigment optical density, the ability to see details of near objects (near vision acuity), and resolution of scotoma (blind spot), when compared with placebo in patients with AMD (60245). Other clinical research in a healthy population shows that taking zeaxanthin alone (Optisharp) as 10 mg daily for 6-12 months increases macular pigment optical density (60175).\n\nMost clinical research in patients with AMD has assessed zeaxanthin in combination with lutein. In general, this combination has been shown to increase macular pigment optical density, as well as the ability to see under low-contrast conditions (contrast sensitivity) and visual acuity. However, most research has used much higher doses of lutein compared with zeaxanthin (60281, 91160, 97225, 106366, 108615). Use of near equal amounts, such as zeaxanthin 8-10 mg daily plus lutein 9-10 mg daily for up to 2 years, seems to improve macular density in adults with or without AMD (60175, 60268, 60270, 106358); however, effects on vision when used for up to 2 years in patients with AMD are conflicting (60245, 60268, 60270, 106358).\n\nZeaxanthin has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, with conflicting findings. A specific supplement (AZYR SIFI) containing zeaxanthin 1 mg, lutein 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 30 mg, zinc 22.5 mg, copper 1 mg, and astaxanthin 4 mg has been used daily for 1-2 years with moderate evidence of benefit (19196, 60244). Taking zeaxanthin 2 mg plus lutein 10 mg in addition to the original Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation (vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc) does not seem to prevent the progression to advanced AMD more than the AREDS formulation alone. However, this progression was modestly inhibited in individuals with low dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin. While progression to late AMD was only modestly inhibited at 5 years when these doses of lutein and zeaxanthin were included in a revised formulation devoid of beta-carotene (60281), results of an additional 5 years of follow up showed that this revised formulation reduces the risk of progression to late AMD by 15% when compared with the formulation containing beta-carotene (108615). Clinical research shows that adding meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg to this revised AREDS formulation (AREDS2) does not further improve contrast sensitivity in patients with non-advanced AMD (106369). In first-generation offspring of parents with neovascular AMD, taking zeaxanthin 2 mg, lutein 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 30 mg, zinc 15 mg, and copper 1 mg daily for 6 months does not improve the macular pigment optical density (106347). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may relate to the patient population, zeaxanthin dose, treatment duration, or other ingredients included in combination products.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for attenuating cognitive decline in older adults.\nClinical research in adults 40-75 years old shows that taking zeaxanthin 2 mg with lutein 10 mg daily for 6 months improves some, but not all, measures of visual memory when compared with placebo. However, other measures of memory and cognitive function were not improved (109763). Also, preliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking the same dose of zeaxanthin and lutein for one year modestly improves some measures of cognitive function, such as complex attention and cognitive flexibility, when compared with placebo (106367). Some observational research in patients 50 years and older has found that higher dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake is associated with greater word recall when compared with lower intake (102891). However, clinical research in patients over 60 years old shows that taking zeaxanthin 2 mg with lutein 10 mg daily for 5 years in addition to vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc (AREDS) does not improve markers of cognitive function, such as memory and verbal fluency, when compared with AREDS alone (94702).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking zeaxanthin 2 mg, lutein 10 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, fish oil 1 gram (providing docosahexaenoic acid 500 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid 150 mg), and vitamin E 15 mg (Memory Health) daily for 12 months does not affect disease severity when compared with placebo. However, there were modest increases in the number of patients experiencing either an improvement or attenuated decline in memory and mood (109764). The effect of zeaxanthin alone is unclear.\nless\nAsthenopia (eye strain). Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nResults from one clinical trial show that taking a combination product (Cerebos Pacific Limited) containing zeaxanthin 1 mg, lutein 5 mg, and black currant extract 200 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly improves visual fatigue and eye stress when compared with placebo in patients completing a two-hour visual proof reading task (60214). The effect of zeaxanthin alone on eye strain is unclear.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for asthma prevention.\nPopulation research has found that a higher dietary intake of zeaxanthin plus lutein is associated with up to 30% lower odds of having asthma when compared with a lower dietary intake (109765). The effects of zeaxanthin intake alone or zeaxanthin supplementation are unclear.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for breast cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that higher serum levels of lutein plus zeaxanthin are associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer (10132). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that giving preterm and low birth weight infants a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg and lutein 0.14 mg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36 weeks' corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo (91163). The effect of zeaxanthin alone is unclear.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults 50-85 years old shows that taking lutein 10 mg plus zeaxanthin 2 mg daily for an average of 4.8 years does not decrease the risk of CVD-related mortality or cardiovascular events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or angina when compared with no supplementation (94701). Individual cardiovascular outcomes were not separately evaluated in this study. The effect of zeaxanthin alone on CVD prevention is unknown.\nless\nCataracts. Increased levels of zeaxanthin in the blood seems to reduce the odds of developing cataracts. It is unclear if dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin is beneficial for cataract treatment or prevention.\nSome population research has found that higher blood levels of zeaxanthin are associated with a 30% lower odds of developing age-related cataracts, and more specifically, a 37% decreased risk of developing nuclear cataracts (90944, 91161). Population research has also found that higher dietary combined intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with lower odds of developing cataracts. However, any association between intake of zeaxanthin itself and the development of cataracts is unclear (91162). Clinical research shows that taking zeaxanthin 2 mg and lutein 10 mg daily orally, in addition to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation containing vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, beta-carotene 15 mg, zinc 80 mg, and copper 2 mg, for an average of 4.7 years decreases the risk of needing cataract surgery by 32% when compared with the AREDS formulation alone in patients with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but not in those with higher dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin (94703).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for child development.\nEpidemiological research has found that a higher dietary intake of zeaxanthin in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy is associated with increased verbal intelligence and improved behavior in the child at 6-10 years of age. However, the ability to discriminate between a novel or familiar visual stimulus was reduced at about 6 months of age, and there were no effects on most cognitive outcomes in children aged 3-6 years (107106). Other epidemiological research has found that a higher dietary intake of zeaxanthin plus lutein in children aged 3-6 years may be associated with modestly improved executive function at 6-11 years. However, there were no effects on most cognitive outcomes in children aged 3-6 years or 6-11 years (109761).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in younger adults shows that taking zeaxanthin 2 mg and lutein 10 mg for one year modestly improves some measures of cognitive function, such as spatial memory, when compared with placebo (106348). Observational research has found that intake of choline and lutein plus zeaxanthin is positively associated with cognitive flexibility task performance speed. However, this association is not present with the intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin in the absence of choline (106354). The effect of zeaxanthin alone is unclear.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nAlthough some individual epidemiological research disagrees (3962), most research has found that dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is not associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (34481, 106372). However, any association with intake of zeaxanthin alone, as supplements or in the diet, is unclear.\nless\nDiabetes. Observational research suggests that oral zeaxanthin may not be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes or diabetic complications.\nSome epidemiological research has found that low serum levels of carotenoids, including zeaxanthin and lutein, are associated with impaired glucose tolerance (60161). Other population research has found that increased dietary intake of zeaxanthin plus lutein does not decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004, 97227). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that an increased serum concentration of zeaxanthin is not associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality over 14 years (109768).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that people who consume higher combined amounts of zeaxanthin and lutein in the diet have a 29% lower risk of developing esophageal squamous cell cancer when compared with lower intake (91159). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for fracture prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that increased dietary intake of zeaxanthin and/or lutein is not associated with a reduced risk of hip fractures (97228). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that increased dietary intake of lutein and/or zeaxanthin is not associated with a reduced risk of developing gastric cancer (97231). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking oral zeaxanthin 2 mg, lutein 10 mg, and meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg daily for 18 months increases macular pigment density, but does not affect visual function, when compared with placebo (109756).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral zeaxanthin for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zeaxanthin for this condition.\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for lung cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that low serum levels of carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (12874). However, other epidemiological research has found that higher serum levels of zeaxanthin are not associated with a reduced risk of dying from lung cancer (39690, 60160).\nless\nMacular telangiectasia type 2. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for macular telangiectasia type 2.\nIn patients with macular telangiectasia type 2, observational research has found that taking a specific combination of lutein 10 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and zeaxanthin 2 mg (MacuShield; Alliance Pharmaceuticals) for at least 6 months, with an average duration of 15.7 months, was associated with a stabilization of visual acuity. Also, the number and size of cavitations in the macula were reduced (106355).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPopulation research in females shows that the highest dietary intake of zeaxanthin plus lutein is associated with 54% reduced odds of developing metabolic syndrome when compared with the lowest intake. However, when supplements containing zeaxanthin plus lutein were included in the total intake, there was no association with metabolic syndrome (109760).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that giving preterm and low birth weight infants a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg and lutein 0.14 mg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36 weeks' corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence of NEC when compared with placebo (91163).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that increased intake of zeaxanthin/lutein in the diet is associated with an 18% lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with low dietary intake. However, no dose-response relationship was reported (97229). It is unknown if supplemental zeaxanthin has any effect on non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that increased dietary intake of zeaxanthin and/or lutein is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (97230). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for Parkinson disease prevention.\nPopulation research has found that people who consume higher amounts of zeaxanthin in the diet do not have a lower risk of developing Parkinson disease (91164). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for the prevention of pre-eclampsia.\nSome epidemiological research has found that the highest intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin during pregnancy is associated with 68% reduced odds of having pre-eclampsia when compared with the lowest intake (109762). The effects of zeaxanthin supplements are unclear.\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for prostate cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that low serum levels of carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, are not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (12874). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of respiratory tract infections.\nEpidemiological research has found that high serum levels of zeaxanthin are not associated with decreased incidence or severity of respiratory tract infections in the elderly (60152). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Oral zeaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in preterm and low birth weight infants shows that giving a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) providing lutein 0.14 mg or 0.5 mg/kg plus zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg or 0.02 mg/kg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36-40 weeks' corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence or severity of retinopathy of prematurity when compared with placebo (60240, 60243, 91163, 102889).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral zeaxanthin is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nIn patients in the remission phase of ulcerative colitis, observational research has found that a higher dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with a reduced incidence of constipation, but not flatulence or feelings of urgency (tenesmus) (106362). The effects of supplemental zeaxanthin are unclear.\nless\nVisual development. It is unclear if taking oral zeaxanthin during pregnancy can improve the visual acuity of the child.\nSome observational research has found that the highest maternal plasma zeaxanthin levels at delivery are associated with a 38% lower risk of poor visual acuity in children at 3 years of age when compared with the lowest maternal zeaxanthin levels (102888). However, other epidemiological research has found that dietary intake of zeaxanthin plus lutein during the first or third trimesters of pregnancy is not associated with contrast vision or visual acuity in the child at 11-12 years of age (109759). The effects of zeaxanthin supplements are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate zeaxanthin for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nZeaxanthin is typically used along with lutein in doses of 2 mg daily for up to 4.8 years. It has also been used less frequently in doses of 8-10 mg daily for up to 12 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nZeaxanthin is better absorbed when taken with a high-fat meal or a high-fat product such as mayonnaise (60223, 60265). Theoretically, use of the fat substitute Olestra may interfere with supplemental zeaxanthin absorption. Olestra lowers serum zeaxanthin concentrations in healthy people (2392).\nStandardization & Formulation\nVarious foods contain zeaxanthin. Orange pepper is richest in zeaxanthin (37% of total carotenoids). Substantial amounts of zeaxanthin (10% to 35%) are also present in egg yolk, corn, red grapes, oranges, honeydew melon, and mango. Although dark green leafy vegetables contain 15% to 47% lutein, they have very low zeaxanthin content (0% to 3%). (3224).\n\nIn clinical research, zeaxanthin is most commonly found alone as a synthesized product or in combination with lutein as a plant extract (usually marigold) (60175, 106351, 106373). Meso-zeaxanthin may be partially synthesized from isolated lutein (106373).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with zeaxanthin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nHuman research shows that zeaxanthin levels reach steady state in plasma after approximately one month of supplementation (60175). After 41 days of continuous dosing, peak zeaxanthin plasma concentrations following a subsequent dose on day 42 occurred approximately 10-11 hours after dosing (15348). A single dose of radio-labelled zeaxanthin reached maximum levels in the circulation 1-3 days post-intake (106357).\n\nThe form of zeaxanthin affects its bioavailability. Zeaxanthin-enriched eggs providing 487 mcg daily for 90 days increases serum zeaxanthin levels by 430% (106361). Other factors such as dietary fat absorption due to pancreatic enzyme efficiency can play a significant role in zeaxanthin bioavailability (15342). Zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin seem to be more bioavailable from a diacetate micromicelle formulation of lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin than from a formulation in sunflower or omega-3 oil (106349). Zeaxanthin also seems to be readily bioavailable from a micronized formulation suspended in medium chain triglycerides (109758). However, bioavailability of zeaxanthin does not seem to be affected by its form of aggregation (106360).\nDistribution\nAfter absorption, zeaxanthin is transported to the retina and other tissues. Some zeaxanthin is also associated with lipoproteins, especially high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (106373). Zeaxanthin is present in the eye (lens, retina, especially the fovea), blood serum, skin, brain (frontal lobe, striate cortex, and visual association cortices), and breast milk (10245, 60094, 60101, 60175, 60277, 60290, 106365, 106349, 106370, 106373). Following supplementation, zeaxanthin increases the density of the macular region of the retina (60175, 60242, 106349, 106352, 106356, 106370).\nMetabolism\nIn the retina, most meso-zeaxanthin likely comes from dietary lutein as opposed to dietary zeaxanthin (106373).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nZeaxanthin is a carotenoid that is typically found in combination with its isomer, lutein. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the two major carotenoid pigments in the human macula, especially in the fovea, and other parts of the retina (3225, 60245). Dietary zeaxanthin occurs in eggs, corn, goji berries, mango, orange pepper, and some other vegetables and fruits (3224, 60091, 106357, 106360).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of zeaxanthin are thought to play a role in its potential mechanism of action in the body. In animal research, zeaxanthin with or without lutein was found to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (106363, 106364).\nNeurological effects\nZeaxanthin is of interest for its potential cognitive effects; however, evidence of benefit from zeaxanthin in combination with higher amounts of lutein is mixed (94702, 102891, 106348, 106352, 106354, 106367, 107106). In elderly adults, zeaxanthin plus lutein for 12 months does not affect the decline in global or prefrontal gray matter. However, in those with the greatest increases in macular pigment optical density (MPOD), which correlates with concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in the brain, the decline in gray matter was reduced (106352, 106373).\nOcular effects\nEpidemiological evidence has associated high dietary zeaxanthin plus lutein intake with a reduced risk of developing late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts (60238, 91162, 106353, 106359). Increasing dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin intake increases serum zeaxanthin levels and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) (10245, 60175, 60242, 60245, 106349, 106352, 106356, 106370, 109756). Zeaxanthin is thought to function as an antioxidant and as a blue light filter, protecting underlying ocular tissues from photodamage (106373). In humans, supplemental zeaxanthin increases visual processing speed (106356). In animal research, zeaxanthin plus lutein was found to modulate genes involved in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the retina (106364).\nSkin effects\nThere is interest in zeaxanthin for preventing UV-radiation damage. In combination with lutein, zeaxanthin may protect against UV-radiation damage due to its antioxidant effects (60184, 106368). In human research, taking lutein plus zeaxanthin seems to improve skin elasticity and have some photoprotective effects (106368)."

            "Overview": "Zedoary is a plant that grows to about 1.2 meters in height (99637). It is native to northeast India, and cultivated widely in Asia (18, 99637). The rhizome is used medicinally. Traditional methods for preparing zedoary rhizome involve prolonged washing with water to remove most of the protein, water-soluble nutrients, and presumably, any unidentified toxic constituent (4015).",

Taking 200 mL of tea prepared with 0.5 gram, 1 gram, or 1.5 grams of zedoary root powder twice daily between meals for 2 months reduces total cholesterol by 9%, 14% and 17% respectively in non-obese men aged 25-40 years with mild hypercholesterolemia. The highest dose also seems to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 6.8% (99637).\nRotaviral diarrhea. A meta-analysis of 5 Chinese studies in children with rotaviral diarrhea shows that giving zedoary turmeric oil injection (route unclear) 10 mg/kg daily for 3-7 days, in addition to standard rehydration therapy, has a higher clinical effectiveness rate than ribavirin combined with standard rehydration therapy. However, the times to defervescence are not significantly different.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of zedoary.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of zedoary is the rhizome. Major chemical components of zedoary are curcumenol, zedoarofuran, curcumenone, bisabolone-9-one, turmeronol B, bisdemethoxycurcumin, desmethoxycurcumin, and curcumin. A water extract also contains zedoarondiol, isozedoarondiol, procurcumadiol, procurcumenol, and curcumenol (112078). Zedoary also contains an essential oil, which is believed to be responsible for many of its pharmacological effects. The oil contains 47% epicurzerenone, 14% curdione, 9% 5-isopropylidene-3,8-dimethyl-1(5H)-azulenone, and 20% beta-tumerone (15895, 15898). Other minor constituents of the oil include 1,8-cineole, camphor, beta-elemene, alpha-terpineol, and others. Zedoary oil has also been found to contain large amounts of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes (15895).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe isolated sesquiterpene constituent dehydrocurdione has anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (4011). In vitro, a methanolic zedoary extract inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), but does not significantly inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This extract does not significantly reduce swelling in an animal model (15897).\nAntimicrobial effects\nZedoary tuber extracts have in vitro activity against several bacteria and fungi, including Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans. However, these extracts do not have activity against Staphylococcus aureus (15896). Zedoary oil also has in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and others (15895).\nBiliary effects\nZedoary is thought to contain curcuminoids, which stimulate bile production and have gallbladder emptying effects (512). Sesquiterpene ketones known as turmerones are also thought to increase bile production (512).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn apolipoprotein E - deficient mice fed a high-cholesterol diet, zedoary water extract 100 mg/kg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus by about 42%, when compared with the high-cholesterol diet alone. The zedoary-treated mice also have reduced serum levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, chemokine CX3CL1, adhesion molecules, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and cathepsins (112078).\nInsecticidal effects\nZedoary oil has larvicidal activity against the mosquito species Anopheles dirus and, to a lesser extent, Aedea aegypti (15894, 15898).\nLiver effects\nSesquiterpenes isolated from zedoary have hepatoprotective effects in animal models (4012). Zedoary aqueous extracts reduce proliferation of human hepatic myofibroblasts (15897)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Zinc is a mineral and an essential nutrient for plants and animals (90200). Zinc deficiency can result in short stature, hypogonadism, reduced ability to taste food, and anorexia (90200). Because the human body does not store excess zinc, an adequate supply must be regularly consumed as part of the diet. Common dietary sources of zinc include red meat, poultry, and fish. Low-income countries in which these foods are not readily available may have a higher prevalence of zinc deficiency (90200).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): While there is some early research suggesting that zinc might be beneficial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, there is no good evidence to support using zinc for patients with COVID-19 who are not admitted to the hospital. There is also no good evidence to support the use of zinc for prevention of COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg daily (7135). ...when used topically and appropriately (2688, 6538, 6539, 7135, 8623, 11051, 111291).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in doses higher than the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Because the UL of zinc is based on regular daily intake, short-term excursions above 40 mg daily are not likely to be harmful. In fact, there is some evidence that doses of elemental zinc as high as 80 mg daily in combination with copper 2 mg can be used safely for approximately 6 years without significant adverse effects (7303, 8622, 92212). However, there is some concern that doses higher than the UL of 40 mg daily might decrease copper absorption and result in anemia (7135).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used intranasally. Case reports and animal research suggest that intranasal zinc might cause permanent anosmia or loss of sense of smell (11155, 11156, 11703, 11704, 11705, 11706, 11707, 16800, 16801, 17083). Several hundred reports of anosmia have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer of some intranasal zinc products (Zicam) (16800, 16801). Advise patients not to use intranasal zinc products.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when taken orally in excessive amounts. Ingestion of 10-30 grams of zinc sulfate can be lethal in adults (7135). Chronic intake of 450-1600 mg daily can cause multiple forms of anemia, copper deficiency, and myeloneuropathies (7135, 17092, 17093, 112473). This has been reported with use of zinc-containing denture adhesives in amounts exceeding the labeled directions, such as several times a day for several years (17092, 17093). Advise patients to follow the label directions on denture adhesives that contain zinc.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (7135). Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for children is based on age: 4 mg daily for 0-6 months, 5 mg daily for 7-12 months, 7 mg daily for 1-3 years, 12 mg daily for 4-8 years, 23 mg daily for 9-13 years, and 34 mg daily for 14-18 years (7135, 97140).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Taking amounts greater than the UL can cause sideroblastic anemia and copper deficiency (7135). ...when used topically on damaged skin. An infant treated with 10% zinc oxide ointment for severe diaper rash with perianal erosions developed hyperzincemia. Absorption seemed to occur mainly via the erosions; plasma levels dropped after the erosions healed despite continued use of the ointment (106905).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 34 mg daily during pregnancy in those 14-18 years of age and 40 mg daily in those 19-50 years of age (7135).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL (7135).\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 34 mg daily during lactation in those 14-18 years of age, and 40 mg daily for those 19-50 years of age (7135).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses exceeding the UL. Higher doses can cause zinc-induced copper deficiency in nursing infants (7135).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, zinc is well tolerated in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL), which is 40 mg daily for adults. Topically, zinc is well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, metallic taste, nausea and vomiting (dose-related).\n\nTopically: Burning, discoloration, itching, stinging, and tingling when applied to irritated tissue.\n\nIntranasally: Bad taste, dry mouth, headache, irritation, reduced sense of smell.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been cases of acute renal tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, neurological complications, severe vomiting, and sideroblastic anemia after zinc overdose.\n\nIntranasally: There have been cases where intranasal zinc caused permanent loss of smell (anosmia).\nDermatologic\nTopically, zinc can cause burning, stinging, itching, and tingling when applied to inflamed tissue (6911, 8623, 87297). Zinc oxide can be deposited in the submucosal tissue and cause dark discoloration of the skin. This can occur with prolonged topical application to intact skin, application to eroded or ulcerated skin, or penetrating traumatic exposure, and also parenteral administration (8618).\n\nIn rare cases, oral zinc has resulted in worsened acne (104056), skin sensitivity (6592), a leishmanial reaction with a macular rash that occurred on exposed parts of the body (86935), eczema (104055), systemic contact dermatitis (109457), and the development of severe seborrheic dermatitis (86946).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, zinc can cause nausea (338, 2663, 2681, 6592, 6700, 18216, 106227, 106230, 106233, 113661, 116212), vomiting (2663, 2681, 6519, 6592, 96069, 96074, 116212), a metallic or objectionable taste in the mouth (336, 338, 6700, 11350, 18216, 106902, 113661), abdominal cramping (6592, 96069), indigestion (87227), heartburn (96069), dry mouth (87533), and mouth irritation (336, 2619). When used orally in amounts above the tolerable upper intake level, zinc may cause irritation and corrosion of the gastrointestinal tract (331, 86982, 87315, 106902), watery diarrhea (1352), epigastric pain (2663, 2681, 116212), and severe vomiting (2663, 2681).\n\nIntranasally, zinc can cause bad taste, dry mouth, and burning and irritation of the throat (8628, 8629).\n\nWhen used topically as a mouth rinse, zinc may cause tooth staining (90206).\nless\nHematologic\nThere is concern that high daily doses of zinc, above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg per day, might increase the risk of copper deficiency, potentially leading to anemia and leukopenia (7135, 112473). To prevent copper deficiency, some clinicians give a small dose of copper when zinc is used in high doses, long-term (7303).\nless\nHepatic\nThere are two cases of liver deterioration in patients with Wilson disease following initiation of treatment with zinc 50-200 mg three times daily. The mechanism of action is not understood, and the event is extremely uncommon (86927, 87470).\nless\nImmunologic\nDaily doses of 300 mg of supplemental zinc for 6 weeks appear to impair immune response (7135). A case of erythematosus-like syndrome, including symptoms such as fever, leg ulcers, and rash, has been reported following intake of effervescent tablets (Solvezink) containing zinc 45 mg (87506). In another case, severe neutropenia was reported after taking supplemental zinc 900 mg daily for an unknown duration (112473).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, zinc may cause body aches in children (113661).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nZinc-containing denture adhesives can cause toxicity if used more frequently than recommended for several years. Case reports describe hyperzincemia, low copper levels, blood dyscrasias, and neurological problems, including sensory disturbances, numbness, tingling, limb weakness, and difficulty walking in patients applying denture adhesive multiple times daily for several years (17092, 17093, 90205, 90233). Due to reports of zinc toxicity associated with use of excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture adhesives for several years, GlaxoSmithKline has reformulated Polygrip products to remove their zinc content (17092, 17093).\n\nIntranasally (8628) and orally (87534), zinc can cause headache. When used orally in amounts above the tolerable upper intake level (UL), zinc may cause central nervous system (CNS) symptoms including lethargy, fatigue, neuropathy, dizziness, and paresthesia (2663, 2681, 87369, 87470, 87533, 87534, 112473).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is concern that zinc might worsen prostate disease. For example, some preliminary evidence suggests that higher dietary zinc intake increases the risk for benign prostatic hyperplasia (6908). Epidemiological evidence suggests that taking more than 100 mg of supplemental zinc daily or taking supplemental zinc for 10 or more years doubles the risk of developing prostate cancer (10306). Another large-scale population study also suggests that men who take a multivitamin more than 7 times per week and who also take a separate zinc supplement have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer-related mortality (15607). However, a large analysis of population research suggests that there is no association between zinc intake and the risk of prostate cancer (96075).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nThere are several hundred reports of complete loss of sense of smell (anosmia) that may be permanent with use of zinc gluconate nasal gel, such as Zicam (11306, 11155, 11707, 16800, 16801, 17083, 86999, 87535). Loss of sense of smell is thought to be dose related but has also been reported following a single application (11306, 11155, 11707, 16800). Patients often report having sniffed deeply when applying the gel, then experiencing an immediate burning sensation, and noticing anosmia within 48 hours (17083). On June 16, 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised patients not to use a specific line of commercial zinc nasal products (Zicam) after receiving 130 reports of loss of smell (16800). The manufacturer of these products had also received several hundred reports of loss of smell related to its intranasal zinc products (16801). Zinc sulfate nasal spray was used unsuccessfully for polio prophylaxis before the polio vaccine was developed. It caused loss of smell and/or taste, which was sometimes permanent (11713). Animal studies suggest that zinc sulfate negatively affects smell, possibly by damaging the olfactory epithelium and neurons (11156, 11703, 11704, 11705, 11706). Zinc gluconate nasal spray has not been tested for safety in animals or humans. The clinical studies of intranasal zinc have not described anosmia as an adverse effect, but testing was not done to see if zinc use adversely affected sense of smell (6471, 8628, 8629, 10247). Also, these clinical studies reported tingling or burning sensation in the nostril, dry nose, nose pain, and nosebleeds.\n\nWhen used in amounts above the tolerable upper intake level (UL), zinc may cause flu-like symptoms including coughing (2663).\nless\nRenal\nIn overdose, zinc can cause acute renal tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis (331, 1352, 87338).\nless\nOther\nOccupational inhalation of zinc oxide fumes can cause metal fume fever with symptoms including fatigue, chills, fever, myalgias, cough, dyspnea, leukocytosis, thirst, metallic taste, and salivation (331).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nZinc deficiency. Orally or intravenously, zinc is effective for treating and preventing zinc deficiency.\nTaking zinc orally or intravenously prevents and treats zinc deficiency (2619). However, routine zinc supplementation is not recommended (403). Zinc deficiency requiring supplementation may occur in patients with severe diarrhea, malabsorption syndromes, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism; after major surgery, renal failure, and dialysis; or during long-term administration of total parenteral nutrition (3900, 24321). Zinc supplementation (136 mg of elemental zinc per day) in patients with cirrhosis and zinc deficiency seems to improve liver function and glucose tolerance, possibly by increasing insulin-like growth factor (8624, 87520).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDiarrhea. Oral zinc reduces duration and severity of acute diarrhea in malnourished children. Doses of 5-20 mg seem to be effective, while 5-10 mg daily is less likely to cause vomiting.\nMost research, including meta-analyses and over 30 clinical trials, show that taking zinc orally reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea in malnourished or zinc-deficient children, but not in well-nourished children ( 87236,96074). Most studies have been conducted in Bangladesh and India, so it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations. The most comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical studies in children older than 6 months shows that zinc supplementation reduces the duration of acute diarrhea by about 11 hours and the duration of persistent diarrhea by about 16 hours when compared with placebo. However, zinc does not seem to reduce the duration of acute diarrhea in children younger than 6 months. Zinc supplementation seems to have the greatest benefit in children with clear malnutrition and diarrhea. In these children, zinc reduces diarrhea duration by about 26 hours and reduces the risk of diarrhea persisting through days 3, 5, and 7 by 18% to 24% when compared with placebo. There was no clear benefit of using zinc in a specific dose or salt form. The most common dose of zinc was 20 mg daily and salt forms included zinc sulfate, gluconate, and acetate (96074). Also, a large clinical trial in children with acute diarrhea shows that taking zinc 5 or 10 mg daily for 14 days is non-inferior to taking 20 mg. Furthermore, zinc 5 or 10 mg results in a respective 29% and 19% lower risk of vomiting within the first 30 minutes when compared with zinc 20 mg (104045).\n\nIt's unclear whether zinc supplementation reduces mortality in children with diarrhea. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of mortality from diarrhea by 15% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation (106239). However, many studies were conducted in hospitals where rates of mortality are low and were not adequately powered to determine whether zinc has an effect on mortality in children with acute diarrhea (87210, 96074, 106239).\nless\nWilson disease. Taking zinc orally improves symptoms of this condition.\nZinc acetate (Galzin) is an FDA-approved orphan drug for treating this condition. Zinc blocks copper absorption and increases copper elimination in the stool of people with Wilson disease (2692, 2693, 87327). Small clinical studies suggest that taking zinc after 8 weeks of treatment with tetrathiomolybdate alone can improve Kayser-Fleischer rings, urine copper levels, and neurological symptoms for up to 6 years post-treatment (63588, 87491).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAcne. Orally, zinc might help to reduce symptoms of acne. However, it's unclear how oral zinc compares to conventional acne treatments. Topical zinc doesn't seem to be beneficial if used alone.\nObservational research has found that people with acne seem to have lower zinc levels in the serum and skin (104056). A meta-analysis of small, low quality clinical trials suggests that taking zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate 137-300 mg 2-3 times daily by mouth can modestly improve acne when compared with placebo (104056). However, not all individual trials show benefit (87002, 104056). So far, it is not clear how oral zinc compares to other treatments. Trials comparing zinc sulfate with various tetracyclines have yielded conflicting results (6505, 6506, 86946, 106233). One large open-label clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks is at least as effective as lymecycline 300 mg daily for reducing acne severity. Quality of life related to acne was modestly improved in the patients using zinc sulfate (106233). However, in another clinical trial, a 3-month treatment of oral zinc gluconate 30 mg daily reduced the number of acne lesions from baseline, but was not as effective as minocycline (86946).\n\nWhen applied topically, clinical research shows that zinc does not help treat acne when compared with placebo (87297, 104056). However, when used in combination with erythromycin, topical zinc seems to result in improvement (819, 820, 2687, 2688).\nless\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica. Oral zinc seems to improve symptoms of this rare genetic disorder.\nMultiple case reports have found that taking oral zinc seems to help improve symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica, a rare disorder (821, 2689, 2690, 2691). One case report in a female with necrolytic acral erythema and hepatitis C suggests that adding oral zinc sulfate 225 mg twice daily to interferon alfa-2b for 6 months contributed to resolving all lesions. Necrolytic acral erythema is categorized in the family of necrolytic erythemas that includes acrodermatitis enteropathica (6192).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral zinc, especially in combination with antioxidant vitamins, seems to slow the progression of AMD.\nClinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 80 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily reduces the odds of progression to advanced AMD by 28%. In patients with more severe AMD, this combination reduced the odds of progression to advanced AMD by 34%. This combination also reduced the odds of visual acuity loss by 27% in patients with severe AMD (7303, 11326). However, there is contradictory evidence about the effects of zinc plus antioxidants on visual acuity loss or the progression to advanced AMD in low-risk patients with AMD (6583, 6584, 7303).\n\nSome clinical evidence shows that, when taken without antioxidant vitamins, zinc supplementation does not slow the progression of existing AMD (6580, 90069). However, a subgroup analysis of results from a large clinical trial that included patients with intermediate or advanced AMD suggests that the effect of zinc on AMD progression might vary depending on a patient's genetic predisposition. Complement factor H (CFH) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) are two genes for which specific variations (i.e., risk alleles) have been associated with an increased risk of AMD. Results from the retrospective subgroup analysis suggest that zinc supplementation may DECREASE the progression of AMD in patients with ARMS2 risk alleles and INCREASE the progression of AMD in patients with CFH risk alleles (90193). However, some experts question the results from this analysis due to the retrospective nature of the study (93045). Another retrospective analysis of similar data found that only zinc plus antioxidants, but not zinc alone, was beneficial for slowing the progression of AMD, regardless of the patient's genotype (93046). Consequently, the American Academy of Ophthalmology does not currently recommend routine genetic screening to determine which patients would benefit from zinc, antioxidants, or the combination. Instead, patients with intermediate or advanced AMD are recommended to take an antioxidant and zinc supplement similar to those used in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) (93047).\n\nLarge scale population studies suggest that increasing dietary intake of zinc might reduce the risk of developing AMD (6579, 14257).\nless\nChild growth. Oral zinc seems to increase growth when taken by children and improve infant growth in the first year of life when taken by pregnant adults.\nA meta-analysis of 8 clinical studies in healthy children over 2 years old shows that taking supplemental zinc 5-15 mg daily for 6-56 weeks modestly increases height and weight when compared with placebo. This analysis also shows that taking zinc may improve height for age, but not weight for age when compared with placebo (112474). Most of these studies were conducted in developing countries; results may not apply elsewhere. Another clinical study in pregnant adults in Peru shows that taking zinc 15 mg daily in addition to iron and folic acid, starting during the first or second trimester and continuing up to one month after delivery, modestly improves growth measures of infants at one year when compared with taking iron and folic acid alone. Improved growth measures include body weight, calf and chest circumference, and calf muscle area (87130).\nless\nCommon cold. Oral zinc seems to help treat cold symptoms in adults. However, it is unclear if zinc is beneficial for common cold prevention.\nUsing zinc oral lozenges seems to be beneficial in helping TREAT the common cold in adults. The majority of clinical trials and analyses of clinical research show a significant decrease in the duration of symptoms of the common cold when adults take zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges providing 9-24 mg of elemental zinc per dose. It is recommended that lozenges be taken every 2 hours while awake, starting within 48 hours of symptom onset for a total daily dose of at least 75 mg in order to attain a mean cold duration reduction of 3 days (333, 334, 335, 337, 6703, 6705, 87501, 92212, 106902). However, not all studies have been positive (333, 338, 339, 6522, 6700, 87512). The reasons for these different findings are not clear, but might be due to differences in zinc formulations and doses and study methodologies. In some cases, flavoring agents such as citric acid, mannitol, and sorbitol might chelate zinc and decrease zinc ionization. Since ionization is thought to be necessary for zinc activity, a decrease in zinc ionization could decrease effectiveness (300, 340, 6522). Some of the positive studies have also been criticized for inadequately blinding the unpleasant, distinctive taste of zinc (6522, 6706). Allergy and smoking status do not appear to impact the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges (92212). Overall, zinc products may be beneficial for modestly reducing the duration of symptoms of the common cold in adults, but adverse effects such as bad taste and nausea may limit their usefulness (18216).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence for the use of oral zinc products to PREVENT colds. Some clinical research suggests that taking zinc prophylactically does not prevent the common cold in adults (10780, 10784) or children (341). However, other clinical research suggests that administering zinc gluconate lozenges can reduce the incidence of colds in children and adolescents (10803, 86972). In a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5446 participants, oral zinc prevented 5 viral upper respiratory tract infections per 100 person months of zinc use when compared with placebo, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20 (106902).\n\nIntranasal zinc is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of the common cold due to the risk for anosmia. See the Adverse Effects section for more information. Some research shows that zinc nasal spray (as a sulfate, gluconate emulsion, or gluconium gel) reduces the severity and duration of cold symptoms; however, other research has found no effect (6471, 8628, 8629, 10247, 87035). Zinc nasal spray does not seem to prevent experimentally-induced colds (8628).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While oral zinc does not seem to speed recovery from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients, an analysis of a small number of studies suggests that oral or intravenous zinc might reduce the risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\nA small observational study in patients with COVID-19 has found that lower serum zinc levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death, when compared with higher zinc levels (105681). Another small observational study has found that 96% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were zinc-deficient based on plasma levels of zinc, and that these patients had lower plasma zinc levels than a group of individuals without COVID-19. However, plasma zinc concentrations were only weakly correlated with length of hospital stay and there was no correlation with morbidity or mortality (106236).\n\nOne clinical study in adult outpatients with COVID-19 shows that taking zinc gluconate 50 mg daily at bedtime, alone or with vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 8000 mg daily, for 10 days does not reduce symptom severity when compared with standard care (104450). This study was terminated prior to complete enrollment due to a lack of effect with zinc and/or vitamin C supplementation. Limitations of this study include a lack of placebo control and blinding. Zinc supplementation also does not appear to enhance the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily during a 6-day course of hydroxychloroquine does not improve the clinical recovery rate, reduce the mortality rate, or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation when compared with hydroxychloroquine alone (104818).\n\nOther research has evaluated zinc in hospitalized patients. Multiple meta-analyses of small and low-quality clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies, involving hospitalized patients with COVID-19 shows that supplementation with oral or intravenous zinc is associated with a 29% to 43% reduction in the odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with control (109451, 110631). However, in one meta-analysis, the odds of 30-day mortality were not different between groups (110631). These meta-analyses did not elevate the most effective form, dose, frequency, or duration of zinc supplementation (109451, 110631). Additionally, a retrospective study in adults admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 has found that those who received oral zinc sulfate, 220 mg daily for a median of 11 days, had a lower 30-day mortality rate when compared with those who did not receive zinc. However, there was no difference in hospital length of stay or in-hospital mortality (106903).\nless\nDepression. Oral zinc seems to be beneficial when used in combination with antidepressant treatments.\nPopulation research has found that higher zinc levels and higher dietary intake of zinc are associated with a 28% lower incidence of depression (90227, 97139, 104057). Oral zinc seems to be beneficial as an adjunct therapy in depression. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality studies in patients with major depression shows that taking zinc in addition to antidepressant therapy is associated with modestly improved depression symptoms when compared with antidepressant therapy alone (104044). Clinical studies used zinc doses of 7-25 mg daily for up to 12 weeks (86985, 90221, 104044). One small clinical study also shows that adding zinc to imipramine therapy might improve depression that was previously resistant to antidepressant treatment (87158).\n\nOne clinical guideline also provisionally recommends use of zinc 25 mg elemental orally daily to treat patients with depression based on low-quality evidence. This guideline recommends use of chelated or picolinate zinc products over other forms of zinc (110318).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral zinc might modestly improve glycemic control in some patients.\nA meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies in patients with diabetes shows that taking zinc supplements reduces fasting blood glucose by up to 20 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.35% when compared with control. However, when only high quality studies were included, the reduction in fasting blood glucose dropped to 12 mg/dL. Zinc seems to only have glycemic benefit in patients living in the Eastern hemisphere, and not the Western hemisphere. Also, glucose reduction seems to be higher with inorganic zinc formulations at doses of at least 30 mg daily taken for at least one month (104080). Zinc has also been evaluated for improving lipid parameters in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of nine studies in patients with diabetes shows that taking zinc reduces triglycerides by 17 mg/dL, but does not seem to affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo (104041). The findings from these meta-analyses are limited by the high heterogeneity and small size of the included studies.\n\nZinc has also been studied for gestational diabetes. Some clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate for 6 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation, reduces fasting plasma glucose levels by about 10% and improves insulin resistance by 14% when compared to baseline (96072). However, taking zinc gluconate does not reduce the need for caesarean section or insulin therapy, or improve infant outcomes, such as size or health at birth, in these patients (96073).\nless\nDiaper rash. Topical and oral zinc seem to reduce the incidence and severity of diaper rash in infants.\nClinical research shows that administering oral zinc gluconate 10 mg daily for 4 months can reduce the incidence of diaper rash in infants when compared with placebo (87281). Other clinical research shows that applying 47% zinc oxide paste to affected areas for 5 days can improve the healing of diaper rash. However, the effect of zinc oxide paste is inferior to eosin 2% solution (86918).\nless\nGingivitis. Topical zinc seems to reduce the development of gingivitis.\nWhile some clinical research shows that zinc, in combination with triclosan, does not prevent plaque and gingivitis (24093, 87020), most clinical research shows that using zinc toothpaste or mouthwash, alone or in combination with triclosan, can prevent plaque accumulation, gingivitis, or the formation of calculus (6523, 6524, 6525, 6526, 6527, 6528, 6529, 87418, 87507). However, most studies used zinc citrate in combination with triclosan, which is not available in the US (6523).\n\nFor treating existing plaque, calculus, and gingivitis, some clinical research suggests that using zinc citrate 0.5% toothpaste three times daily for 3 months reduces calculus scores by 14% when compared with placebo (87205). However, other evidence suggests that stannous fluoride 0.454% toothpaste is more effective than zinc citrate 0.75% toothpaste for reducing plaque levels (87136).\nless\nHalitosis. Oral zinc seems to reduce halitosis when taken as a gum, mouth rinse, or candy.\nClinical research shows that chewing zinc-containing gum reduces volatile sulfur compounds and related odor levels when compared with placebo gum in patients with moderate to severe halitosis (87538). Clinical research also shows that using one of two mouth rinses (Halita, which contains 0.05% chlorhexidine and 0.14% zinc lactate, or Meridol, which contains 0.025% fluoride plus 0.2% zinc lactate) improves breath odor and volatile sulfur compounds by approximately two-fold when compared with mouth rinse containing only 0.05% fluoride or chlorhexidine 0.12% (90206). Additional clinical research shows that sucking a candy containing abrasive substances and zinc gluconate 0.5% or candy containing abrasive substances plus zinc 0.25% and propolis 1% improves breath malodor two- to three-fold when compared with sucking placebo candy (90196).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Topical zinc seems to reduce the severity and duration of cold sores.\nApplying zinc topically seems to help treat herpes simplex infection (6538, 6539, 8623, 11051). Zinc sulfate seems to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms in both orolabial and genital herpes (6538, 6539). Zinc oxide (0.3%) in combination with glycine cream applied topically every 2 hours to facial and circumoral herpes seems to reduce symptoms such as blistering, soreness, itching, and tingling. It can also reduce the duration of lesions from 6.5 days to 5 days when treatment is begun within 24 hours of onset of symptoms (8623). A specific combination product containing zinc oxide and L-lysine plus 14 other ingredients (Super Lysine Plus +) also seems to help decrease symptoms and duration of herpes lesions when applied topically every 2 hours (11051). However, zinc may not be effective for recurrent herpes simplex infections. In one clinical study, applying zinc sulfate 0.0025% or 0.05% solution to affected areas did not reduce the frequency, severity, or duration of herpes episodes when compared with a placebo solution in patients experiencing more than five episodes per year (87330).\nless\nHypogeusia. Oral zinc might improve taste disturbance and taste acuity in people with hypogeusia of various etiologies.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality studies in patients with taste disorders that are idiopathic or due to zinc deficiency shows that taking oral zinc modestly improves taste acuity when compared with placebo (104055). Studies tested zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, and zinc-carnosine as Polaprezinc (Promac, Zeria Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), containing 17-68 mg elemental zinc, daily for up to 12 weeks (104055). Zinc also might improve hypogeusia conditions unrelated to zinc deficiency, such as gustin/carbonic anhydrase VI deficiency, captopril-induced taste disturbances, hypogeusia due to chronic renal failure, and post-traumatic olfactory disorder (6543, 6544, 104055). It also seems be beneficial in radiation-induced dysgeusia. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that oral zinc reduces the risk of radiation-induced dysgeusia by 28%, but does not improve taste acuity when compared with placebo (104043).\n\nHowever, patients with hypogeusia from other causes may not benefit. Zinc supplementation does not seem to improve taste perception when compared with placebo in patients with acetazolamide-induced taste dysfunction or chemotherapy-induced taste dysfunction (87388, 90214).\nless\nLeishmania lesions. Oral zinc and intralesional injections of zinc might improve healing of these lesions.\nClinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate 2.5-10 mg/kg orally in three divided doses daily, improves the cure rate of cutaneous leishmania lesions after 45 days when compared with no treatment (86935). Other clinical research shows that intralesional injections of zinc sulfate 2% solution for 6 weeks improves cure rates of cutaneous leishmania lesions when compared with no treatment (6587). However, intralesional injections with zinc sulfate solution does not appear to be more effective than intralesional injections of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime), hypertonic saline, or sodium stibogluconate (6587, 86996, 87008).\nless\nLeprosy. Oral zinc seems to be beneficial when used in combination with anti-leprosy drugs.\nZinc levels appear to be reduced in people with leprosy. Early clinical research suggests that the addition of zinc improves tolerance of the anti-leprosy drug regimen and might allow for lowering or eliminating steroid doses in erythema nodosum leprosum, a severe form of leprosy (6534, 6535, 6536, 6537).\nless\nLow birth weight. Oral zinc supplementation seems to improve growth in low birth weight infants. Whether oral zinc can improve other outcomes, including mortality, is unclear. Taking oral zinc during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a low birth weight infant.\nWhile there is some mixed evidence regarding the effects of zinc supplementation on weight gain and length in infants born with low birth weight (87172, 87452, 90229), a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, increases weight by around 380 grams, length by around 3 cm, and head circumference by around 0.6 cm when compared with control (109455).\n\nThere is also mixed evidence regarding the effect of zinc supplementation on other outcomes in low birth weight infants. A large clinical trial in full-term, underweight infants aged 1-6 months in developing countries shows that adding zinc to nutritional supplementation reduces the risk of mortality by about 68% when compared with nutritional supplementation not containing zinc (8920). A small clinical trial in very low birth weight preterm infants born in an industrialized country shows that adding zinc to multivitamin supplementation appears to reduce the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality. However, adding zinc does not appear to prevent late-onset sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or retinopathy of prematurity (90229). A meta-analysis of these trials and two other studies in low birth weight infants shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 52% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation (106239). Another small clinical study in low birth weight and preterm infants born in a developing country shows that zinc supplementation seems to improve alertness and attention when compared with placebo (97140). However, a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, does not improve mental or psychomotor development or reduce the risk of mortality, hospitalization, acute respiratory infection, or sepsis when compared with control (109455). Some of these discrepant findings may be due to differences in patient populations (hospitalized, non-hospitalized), milk sources (breastfed, formula-fed, or both), and duration of follow-up.\n\nThe effect of zinc intake or supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated. Population research has found that low dietary intake of zinc during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight in infants; similarly, zinc supplementation is associated with increased infant weight at birth (87471, 105678). However, a meta-analysis and a large clinical study show that zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of having a low birth weight infant (97142, 105679). Reasons for the discrepancies may be due to differing zinc status prior to supplementation. Also, numerous factors contribute to the risk of low birth weight, which may confound research on the use of zinc supplementation alone.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Oral zinc seems to treat and prevent peptic ulcers.\nTaking zinc orally seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers (6588, 6589, 6591). Some clinical research shows that zinc acexamate improves peptic ulcers when compared with placebo (6589, 87285), and seems to be as effective as H2-receptor antagonist drugs (6589, 87533). It is not known if other zinc salts are effective.\nless\nPneumonia. Oral zinc might reduce the risk for pneumonia in children, but it doesn't seem to improve symptoms in children that already have pneumonia.\nA meta-analysis of four clinical studies shows that giving zinc supplements to children, ages 3 months to 5 years living in developing countries, some of whom were undernourished, reduces the risk of pneumonia incidence by 21% when compared with placebo (104047). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of pneumonia mortality by 21% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation (106239).\n\nThe research on TREATING existing pneumonia in children is inconsistent. Most meta-analyses and clinical studies in children ages 2 months to 5 years with severe pneumonia show that taking elemental zinc in addition to antibiotic therapy does not improve symptom resolution or the time to recovery when compared with antibiotic therapy alone. Zinc also does not seem to reduce mortality in these patients (87248, 90197, 96080, 98131, 104042). However, two clinical studies in children in the same age group with pneumonia suggest that adding zinc to standard antibiotic therapy improves symptom resolution and decreases hospital stay when compared with placebo (11052, 87242). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear, but may be related to zinc status prior to treatment.\nless\nPrematurity. Analyses of clinical studies suggest that oral zinc improves growth in premature infants. Whether zinc improves development or reduces the risk of mortality in these patients is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in hospitalized infants born prematurely suggests that receiving enteral zinc supplementation at a dose of up to 10 mg daily reduces mortality and might improve short-term weight gain when compared with placebo (105687). Another meta-analysis of small clinical studies in preterm infants shows that adding zinc to formula or to a multivitamin seems to modestly increase infant weight and height and improve motor development when compared with control (105676). A larger meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, increases weight by around 380 grams, length by around 3 cm, and head circumference by around 0.6 cm when compared with control. However, zinc supplementation did not improve mental or psychomotor development or reduce the risk of mortality, hospitalization, acute respiratory infection, or sepsis when compared with control (109455). These analyses are limited by imprecision as well as a high risk of bias in some of the included studies. Some of the discrepant findings may be due to differences in patient populations (hospitalized, non-hospitalized), milk sources (breastfed, formula-fed, or both), and duration of follow-up.\nless\nPressure ulcers. Topical zinc paste seems to work as a skin barrier and improve pressure ulcer healing. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that applying zinc oxide paste to pressure ulcers daily for 8 weeks reduces necrotic tissue and decreases the surface area of skin pressure ulcers similarly to using a topical streptokinase-streptodornase product (Varidase) (87331). Other small clinical studies show that applying zinc oxide paste to pressure ulcers daily for 8-12 weeks improves healing similarly to a hydrocolloid dressing (Duoderm) (87181) or a specific barrier film product (Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film) (87017).\n\nOral zinc has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients shows that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with zinc, L-arginine, and vitamin C improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet (31953, 87173). Also, clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, zinc, L-arginine, and vitamin C daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline (32045). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSickle cell disease. Oral zinc seems to improve symptoms of sickle cell disease in patients with zinc deficiency.\nTaking zinc orally seems to help reduce symptoms of sickle cell disease in people with zinc deficiency (6594, 6595, 6596, 8626, 87343). Taking zinc supplements also seems to decrease the occurrence rate of sickle-cell crises and infections (6594, 6596, 90228). Additionally, zinc might reduce the number of hospitalizations for sickle cell crises, although the severity of the crises that do develop is not necessarily decreased by taking zinc supplements (6594, 6596). In prepubertal children and adolescents with homozygous sickle cell disease, taking zinc seems to improve growth, height, and weight gain (8626, 87403).\nless\nWarts. Oral and topical zinc seem to improve the cure rate of cutaneous warts.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children and adults with cutaneous warts shows that oral and topical zinc increases the rate of remission of warts when compared with control (117071). However, the validity of the analyses is limited by heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of varying age and disease severity, with different types and location of warts, and utilized variable forms and dosages of zinc. Zinc has been used topically as zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, or nitric-zinc complex solution for up to 6 months (87082, 87094, 117071). Orally, zinc sulfate is most commonly used in doses of 400 mg to 600 mg daily for 2-6 months (117071). Other preliminary clinical research in adults treated with cryotherapy for anogenital warts shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg orally three times daily for 2 months does not reduce the number of warts when compared with placebo.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAlopecia areata. Oral zinc does not seem to improve symptoms of this condition.\nAlthough there is preliminary evidence that suggests zinc in combination with biotin might be helpful for alopecia areata (6932), most studies indicate that zinc is not effective for alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, or alopecia universalis (6931, 6932).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Oral zinc does not improve cystic fibrosis symptoms or progression.\nClinical research shows that taking supplements providing 30-90 mg of elemental zinc for 6 weeks to one year does not improve lung function when compared with placebo in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (87066, 87113, 96079). One clinical study also shows that taking elemental zinc for one year does not reduce the number of days requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary infections (96079). However, one study shows that taking zinc can reduce the number of days of oral antibiotic use when compared with placebo (87113).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Oral zinc does not seem to improve outcomes in patients with HIV.\nClinical research in adult HIV patients with normal or low zinc levels shows that taking elemental zinc 12-15 mg daily orally for 18 months along with antiretroviral therapy does not improve viral load, CD4/8 counts, or mortality when compared with placebo (87036, 87216, 105686). In children with HIV-1, clinical research shows that administering zinc sulfate, providing 10 mg elemental zinc, daily for 6 months does not improve mortality, viral load, or CD4 counts when compared with placebo (82377).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related pregnancy complications. Oral zinc does not prevent pregnancy complications related to HIV infection.\nAdding zinc 25 mg orally during pregnancy does not seem to reduce parent-to-child vertical transmission of HIV, infant mortality, birth weight, or gestational period in HIV-infected females with low zinc levels (11054, 87034). Also, one clinical study in HIV-1-infected pregnant patients suggests that supplemental zinc can increase the risk of wasting, as assessed by weight and mid-upper arm circumference, by 170% when compared with placebo (87034).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral zinc does not seem to improve HIV-related wasting syndrome.\nA clinical study in patients with HIV-related wasting syndrome shows that taking zinc orally in combination with vitamins and albendazole does not seem to improve diarrhea or mortality when compared with taking albendazole alone (6564).\nless\nInfant development. Oral zinc does not seem to improve infant mental and psychomotor development.\nClinical research, including a meta-analysis of eight studies, shows that giving zinc to infants or children at high risk for zinc deficiency does not improve mental and psychomotor development when compared with placebo (87013, 90209). In another meta-analysis of studies in children whose baseline zinc status was not specified, there was no beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on mental or psychomotor development at 6 or 12 months of age (104817).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral zinc does not improve symptoms of IBD.\nSome clinical research shows that taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat IBD (6913, 6915, 6916).\nless\nInfluenza. Oral zinc does not seem to reduce the risk for influenza.\nSupplemental zinc seems to improve cell-mediated immune response in elderly people (824), but it does not seem to have a significant effect on antibody response and incidence of influenza infection after the vaccine (6553, 6563). Additionally, zinc supplementation in patients on hemodialysis, who have a high risk of zinc deficiency, does not seem to improve response to influenza vaccine (10809). Taking zinc supplements orally is unlikely to improve immune function in people without risk factors for zinc deficiency (10789). However, there is preliminary evidence that suggests zinc along with selenium might reduce the incidence of infections in institutionalized older patients (8921).\nless\nOtitis media. Oral zinc does not prevent otitis media in children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 3-70 mg daily for up to 24 months does not prevent the occurrence of ear infections in children from low- or middle-income countries (87258).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral zinc taken prenatally does not seem to be beneficial for pre-eclampsia prevention.\nA meta-analysis and a large clinical study show that zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo (97142, 105679).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral zinc does not reduce the risk for prostate cancer or prostate cancer-related mortality.\nSome epidemiological research has found an inverse relationship between dietary zinc intake and prostate cancer (96075). Also some clinical research shows that taking zinc 20 mg in combination with vitamin C 120 mg, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 30 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, and selenium 100 mcg daily for an average of 8 years might reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men with normal PSA levels; however, it does not seem to be beneficial for reducing the risk of prostate cancer in patients with PSA levels above 3 mcg/L (14135).\n\nHowever, some evidence raises concern that zinc might actually INCREASE the risk of prostate cancer. A large-scale population study found that taking more than 100 mg of supplemental zinc daily or taking supplemental zinc for 10 or more years doubles the risk of developing prostate cancer (10306). Another large-scale population study shows that men who take a multivitamin more than seven times per week and who also take a separate zinc supplement have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer-related mortality (15607). Despite these studies suggesting the potential for adverse effects of zinc, a meta-analysis of mainly population research has found that there is no association between zinc intake and the risk of prostate cancer (96075).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral zinc does not reduce the severity of psoriasis symptoms.\nZinc epidermal levels are reportedly lower in people with psoriasis (6509). However, taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat psoriasis (6513, 6514, 6912, 87363). Zinc supplementation has no effect on the psoriasis area and severity index (6513, 6514).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral zinc does not treat symptoms of RA.\nMultiple clinical studies in patients with RA show that taking zinc orally does not improve function or symptoms when compared with baseline or control (6517, 6518, 6519, 87406).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. Oral zinc does not improve sexual function in males with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nClinical research shows that zinc supplementation does not improve sexual activity or libido when compared with placebo in males with sexual dysfunction secondary to CKD (6708, 6568, 87220, 87386, 87416). In fact, one clinical study shows that taking zinc can decrease the frequency of intercourse by 76% when compared with placebo in patients with CKD-related sexual dysfunction (87220).\nless\nTinnitus. Oral zinc does not improve severity of tinnitus or reduce tinnitus-related disability.\nA meta-analysis of three small clinical trials in adults with tinnitus shows that taking elemental zinc 50 mg daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve tinnitus severity, or disability from tinnitus when compared with placebo (104051).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nMalaria. Oral zinc does not prevent or treat malaria in undernourished children or pregnant adults in developing countries.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children or pregnant adults shows that taking zinc orally, alone or in combination with other supplements, for does not reduce the risk of malaria parasitemia (111444). A large multi-country study in zinc-deficient preschool children with acute malaria shows that taking zinc supplements does not affect fever, parasitemia, or hemoglobin when compared with placebo (10246). An even larger clinical study of over 40,000 children with malaria aged 1-36 months shows that taking zinc 5-10 mg daily orally for approximately 17 months does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo (87078). Zinc supplements also do not appear to protect against infection by Plasmodium falciparum (8638, 87235, 86937). However, one small study in children with low and high levels of parasitemia shows that taking zinc 10 mg daily for 46 weeks may lower the incidence of fever episodes by 38% and 69%, respectively, when compared with placebo (86937).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with age-related cognitive decline.\nAn epidemiological study based on elderly adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has found that taking zinc may improve cognition in a non-linear manner. Daily doses below 9 mg and 8 mg in males and females, respectively, showed a positive association with cognitive function, but doses above that level showed no association. Additionally, high intake of both zinc and selenium was associated with improved cognition in females, but not in males (108446). Dietary intake was collected from two patient-reported 24-hour recalls and cognition was only measured once, limiting the validity of these findings.\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with alcoholic-related liver cirrhosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis shows that taking zinc sulfate 600 mg daily for 6 weeks improves liver function, based on increased alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced serum bilirubin, when compared to baseline (87325).\nless\nAnorexia nervosa. Oral zinc seems to improve weight gain in people with anorexia nervosa.\nAnorexia nervosa might be linked with zinc deficiency. Small clinical trials in adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa show that oral zinc supplements might help increase weight gain and improve depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (6905, 6906).\nless\nArsenic poisoning. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that taking zinc 4 mg in combination with spirulina extract 500 mg daily for 16 weeks can decrease skin manifestations and reduce arsenic levels in the urine and in hair of patients with chronic arsenic poisoning (18301).\nless\nAsthenopia (eye strain). Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults without dry eye disease shows that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine 50 mg, elderberry fruit extract 300 mg, currant 100 mg, and Eleutherococcus root 50 mg (Meramirt CM) orally once daily for 1 month improves measures of eye strain and contrast sensitivity when compared to baseline. Improvements in these measures were lacking in the control group (111295). Statistical comparison between the two groups was not reported. It is unclear if these effects are due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of zinc 90 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not improve grip strength, squat, or bench press performance when compared with placebo (113655).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for alleviating eczema in children.\nA small clinical study in children with eczema shows that taking zinc sulfate 185.4 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not appear to improve the surface area affected and degree of erythema, symptom scores of itch and sleep disturbance, or topical steroid use when compared with placebo. Also, plasma zinc levels appear to be normal in children with eczema (6911).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral zinc might improve certain symptoms in children with ADHD.\nObservational research has found that lower serum zinc levels are both more prevalent in children with ADHD and are linked to worsened response to stimulant therapy (9965, 9966, 9967). Based on this evidence, there is some interest in using zinc to improve symptoms in children with ADHD. A meta-analysis of six small clinical trials shows that although taking zinc modestly improves overall symptoms of ADHD when compared with placebo, there is no effect on hyperactivity or inattention when these outcomes are examined separately. The sub-analyses conducted for these two separate outcomes included only 3 studies. Most, but not all, of the included studies were conducted in children also receiving methylphenidate treatment (106240). Elemental zinc, usually as sulfate, was typically used in doses of 10-40 mg daily for 6-12 weeks (11350, 12060, 106240). There is some evidence that zinc could be most helpful in children with a high body mass index (BMI), low zinc levels, and low free fatty acid levels (11350). It is unclear if zinc is beneficial in children who are not already taking stimulant medications.\n\nOne clinical guideline also provisionally recommends against use of oral zinc to treat patient with ADHD based on low-quality evidence (110318).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with autism spectrum disorder.\nOne small clinical study conducted in children with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking zinc 15-30 mg orally, alone or as add-on therapy to amphetamine, does not improve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms when compared with placebo (98711). However, the optimal mg/kg dose of amphetamine was shown to be 37% lower for those children also taking zinc 15 mg twice daily when compared with those taking placebo (98711).\nless\nAutoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with autoimmune thyroiditis.\nA small clinical study in children aged 3-18 years with autoimmune thyroiditis shows that taking zinc acetate 25 mg daily in addition to standard therapy for 12 weeks does not change thyroid auto-antibody levels, thyroid function tests, or oxidative stress markers when compared with standard therapy alone. However, subjects taking zinc did not require escalation in levothyroxine doses when compared with the control group control group, which did require levothyroxine dose escalation (113661).\nless\nBehcet disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with Behcet disease.\nA small clinical trial in patients with Behcet disease shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve disease activity scores, quality of life, or measures of inflammation when compared with placebo (109453).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although there is interest in using oral zinc for BPH, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition.\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with beta-thalassemia major.\nA small clinical study in children recently diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major shows that initiating zinc sulfate in addition to standard blood transfusions increases linear growth rate when compared with transfusions alone (87329). Another small clinical study in adult and pediatric patients with thalassemia major and low bone mass shows that taking zinc 25 mg daily (as zinc sulfate) for 18 months improves whole-body bone mineral content, as well as hip and spine bone mineral density, by small amounts when compared with placebo (90208).\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if dietary zinc is beneficial for reducing the risk for brain cancer.\nPopulation research has found that zinc intake is not associated with a reduced risk of developing brain cancer (87098).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if increased dietary zinc intake is beneficial for reducing the risk for breast cancer.\nPopulation research has found that neither zinc intake nor blood levels of zinc are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (106229).\nless\nBronchiolitis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for viral bronchiolitis in infants and children.\nA small clinical study in children 2 years or younger with acute viral bronchiolitis shows that taking elemental zinc 10-20 mg as zinc sulfate for 5 days improves clinical recovery and reduces the duration of hospital stay by almost one day when compared with placebo. After 72 hours, 98% of infants and children taking zinc were considered fully recovered, compared to only 52% of infants taking placebo (96076).\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking zinc 15 mg and vitamin C 35 mg once daily, along with a vitamin B complex twice daily, for 30 days modestly decreases pain and burning when compared to baseline (105195). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefit is due to zinc, other vitamins, or the combination.\nless\nBurns. Intravenous zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. The effects of oral zinc for burn healing are unclear.\nAdministering zinc intravenously in combination with other minerals seems to improve the outcomes of burn patients. Supplementation with zinc, copper, and selenium appears to improve wound healing, reduce pulmonary infections, and shorten intensive care unit stay in patients with serious burns (6520, 87085). The effect of supplementation with zinc alone is unclear.\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with canker sores.\nEvidence for the use of zinc in canker sores is conflicting. A small clinical crossover study in patients with recurrent canker sores shows that taking zinc sulfate 660 mg daily for 3 months does not improve the size or frequency of canker sore ulcers when compared with control (6592). However, another clinical study in patients with recurrent sores and low or normal zinc levels shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg daily for 1 month reduces recurrence of sores when compared with placebo (86964). Reasons for conflicting results are unclear. Zinc might be beneficial when used in a muco-adhesive formulation. A small clinical study in patients with canker sores shows that taking a muco-adhesive zinc sulfate 5 mg tablet three times daily for 7 days reduces pain and speeds up healing when compared with placebo (104048).\nless\nCataracts. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTaking zinc orally in combination with antioxidant vitamins does not seem to help treat or prevent cataracts. Taking elemental zinc 80 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily does not seem to have any effect on the development or progression of age-related lens opacities (cataracts) or the need for cataract surgery in well-nourished people 55-80 years of age. However, it is unknown whether earlier intervention and/or a longer period of treatment with supplements would have any effect on cataracts (7304).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces the severity of acral erythema induced in patients treated with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) treatment regorafenib.\nA small study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing treatment with regorafenib shows that taking zinc gluconate 78 mg twice daily reduces the proportion of patients with more severe acral erythema when compared with control. Though there is no association in the zinc treatment group, lower serum zinc levels seem to correlate with more severe acral erythema in the control group, suggesting a possible role of zinc deficiency in the pathogenesis of acral erythema (112472). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding.\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms in patients with fatigue due to chemotherapy.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer shows that taking zinc 70 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve fatigue or quality of life when compared with placebo (97141).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in females with CFS shows that taking zinc 10 mg as zinc sulfate plus melatonin 1 mg daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces self-reported symptoms of physical fatigue when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on cognitive or psychological symptoms, sleep, or symptoms of anxiety or depression (106241). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if zinc is beneficial for reducing cirrhosis-related mortality.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials shows that zinc supplementation does not seem to reduce mortality in patients with cirrhosis when compared with control (104054). This finding is limited due to the heterogeneity and small size of the available studies.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if zinc is beneficial for cognitive function.\nA very small clinical study in adults with overweight and obesity shows that taking supplemental zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of cognitive function and executive processing but does not improve verbal fluency when compared with placebo (112471). Zinc has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking a specific product containing a combination of zinc 9 mg, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, and other ingredients (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare, Milano, Italy) orally daily for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo (110923).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study shows that taking a combination supplement containing zinc 30 mg, selenium 200 mcg (as l-selenomethionine), vitamin A 2 mg (as retinol), vitamin C 180 mg, and vitamin E 30 mg (as D-a-tocopherol acetate) by mouth daily for 5 years or until the recurrence of an adenoma reduces the risk of recurrent large-bowel adenomas by approximately 40% when compared with placebo (92903). It is not clear if the benefit is due to zinc, other supplements, or the combination.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing colorectal cancer risk.\nPopulation research has found that increased intake of zinc is associated with a 17% to 20% reduced risk of colorectal cancer (90213, 90220).\nless\nCongenital heart disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing the risk of congenital heart defects.\nAn observational study in pregnant adults has found that consuming the recommended nutritional intake of zinc may be associated with a lower risk of total congenital heart defects in infants, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, when compared with low zinc intake. This association appears to persist despite copper or selenium intake (108445).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for critically ill patients.\nA meta-analysis of two small randomized clinical trials in adults with head trauma shows that supplementing zinc, given as 120 mg elemental zinc orally daily or 12 mg elemental zinc intravenously daily for 15 days to 3 months, regardless of serum zinc levels, does not improve the risk of 30-day mortality when compared with control (111290). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDementia. Although there is interest in using oral zinc for dementia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral zinc for diabetic foot ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition.\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in patients with poorly-controlled diabetic neuropathy shows that taking zinc sulfate 660 mg daily for 6 weeks improves motor nerve conduction velocity and reduces fasting and postprandial blood sugar when compared to baseline (86933). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the control group.\nless\nDown syndrome. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for improving immune function in people with this condition.\nA very small clinical study in Down syndrome patients with zinc deficiency shows that taking zinc sulfate 1 mg/kg daily for 2 months seems to improve immune function and reduce recurrent infections when compared with baseline (87289). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Another small clinical study in children with Down syndrome shows that zinc 25-50 mg daily for 6 months does not improve immune function when compared with placebo (87278). Reasons for the discrepancies may be related to the dose of zinc or zinc status at baseline.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral zinc might reduce pain in some patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\nA meta-analysis of six low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in generally healthy patients 13-27 years of age with primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking zinc reduces patient-reported pain scores when compared with placebo. Sub-group analyses show that pain severity is reduced after 2 and 3 months but not after 1 month. These studies utilized heterogenous dosing protocols, providing elemental zinc in doses of 7-150 mg daily, either starting a few days before menstruation or on the day of menstruation and continuing for 3-13 days (116213). The validity of these results is limited by these heterogeneous dosing regimens. Furthermore, the majority of studies were conducted in Iran. One individual clinical study included in the meta-analysis shows that taking zinc sulfate 40 mg orally daily for the first 3 days of menstruation for three cycles reduces average pain scores by 51% when compared with placebo (111446).\nless\nEpilepsy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of zinc in children with intractable seizures.\nA small clinical study in children with intractable epilepsy shows that taking elemental zinc 1 mg/kg daily as zinc sulfate heptahydrate for 6 months reduces seizures when compared with placebo. About 31% of children taking zinc experienced a 50% decrease in seizure frequency, compared to only 5% of children taking placebo (96078).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with erectile dysfunction.\nA moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing zinc 15 mg, L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone (114989). It is unclear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, including the use of per-protocol analysis and lack of a placebo group.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research in Chinese and Iranian patients has found that low intake of zinc is associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer (17205, 87059). However, other population research in patients from America, Europe, or Asia has found that dietary zinc intake is not associated with esophageal cancer risk (90213).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing fatigue in older individuals.\nA clinical study in adults 50 years and older, some with below-normal levels of zinc at baseline, shows that taking zinc 30 mg daily for 70 days improves subjective fatigue when compared with no intervention (105675). The validity of this finding is limited due to a lack of placebo control and potential performance bias. Additionally, it is unclear whether baseline zinc status alters the benefits of zinc supplementation.\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if dietary zinc is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that increased dietary zinc intake is not associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer (90213).\nless\nHead and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc improves survival in patients with head and neck cancers.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with head and neck cancers shows that zinc supplementation does not improve disease-free or metastasis-free survival rates after 3 years when compared with placebo (87103).\nless\nHepatic encephalopathy. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing the severity of hepatic encephalopathy or preventing recurrence.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies, as well as some individual clinical studies, show that short-term zinc supplementation improves cognitive function and possibly quality of life in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. These findings are based on results from the number connection test and other tests (87377, 90202, 106227). One study in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy used zinc bisglycinate 75 mg three times daily, providing elemental zinc 45 mg daily for 12 weeks (106227). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that short-term zinc supplementation does not improve hepatic encephalopathy severity when compared with placebo when assessed using Conn's index, which includes evaluation of mental state, asterixis (flapping tremor), number connection test, electroencephalogram (EEG) record, and plasma ammonia (87144). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that zinc sulfate supplementation does not reduce encephalopathy recurrence (90202). Based on these results, zinc supplementation may marginally improve cognitive function in hepatic encephalopathy patients, but it does not appear to improve disease severity or reduce the risk of recurrence.\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related diarrhea. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing diarrhea in adult HIV patients.\nShort-term zinc supplementation does not appear to TREAT diarrhea in adult HIV patients with persistent diarrhea. Clinical research shows that taking zinc 50 mg twice daily for 7 days does not reduce the duration of HIV-related diarrhea when compared with placebo (87055). However, zinc supplementation may help PREVENT HIV-related diarrhea when administered long-term. Clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 12-15 mg daily for 18 months reduces the rate of diarrhea by about half when compared with placebo in adult HIV patients with zinc deficiency (87216).\n\nIn HIV-infected children, clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 10 mg daily for 6 months can reduce the occurrence of diarrhea by 49% when compared with placebo (82377). However, administering zinc in combination with vitamin A until 2 years of age does not reduce the occurrence of diarrhea when compared with vitamin A alone in HIV-infected children (82417).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related opportunistic infections. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDs.\nA small clinical study in patients with AIDS shows that taking zinc supplements orally in combination with zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir) might reduce opportunistic infections of Pneumocystis carinii and Candida when compared with taking zidovudine without zinc (6566).\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing relapse in patients with vulvar warts or for treating HPV infections and cervical lesions in patients with abnormal cervical cytology.\nOne small clinical study in patients with vulvar warts shows that taking zinc sulfate 400 mg daily for 8 weeks in addition to topical treatments including podophyllin 20%, imiquimod 5%, or cryotherapy, does not affect the duration of response, but does reduce the relapse rate by approximately 66% after 6 months, when compared with topical treatments alone (90190). Additionally, a small, open-label study in zinc-sufficient females with HPV shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces the odds of persistent HPV infection by 87% and improves the resolution of pre-existing cervical lesions when compared with no treatment (109456).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces blood pressure in normotensive or hypertensive patients.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking zinc reduces systolic blood pressure by about 1.5 mmHg, but does not reduce diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo. Response did not differ with the dosage of zinc or duration of supplementation. Only one study evaluated patients with hypertension; other patient populations included those with type 2 diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, pre-diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and patients on dialysis (104052). More research in patients with hypertension is needed to determine if zinc is beneficial in this population.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). While some conflicting evidence exists, several small clinical studies suggest that oral zinc may improve glycemic control in patients with prediabetes.\nA meta-analysis of three low-quality studies in patients with prediabetes suggests that taking zinc sulfate 20-30 mg, alone or in combination with lysine and vitamin C, for 6-12 months reduces fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose when compared with control (105682). Furthermore, a small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 90 days improves glycemic parameters when compared with placebo. All study participants were also instructed to increase physical activity and start a calorie-restricted diet (105391). However, another small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 12 months does not improve glycemic parameters when compared with placebo (109454). The available research has been conducted in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Iran, and Australia; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nIntestinal parasite infection. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with intestinal parasitic infections.\nZinc supplementation may help TREAT infection from Schistosoma mansoniin, but not other parasites, in children in developing countries. Results from one clinical study show that taking oral zinc sulfate 30-50 mg for 12 months reduces the intensity of Schistosoma mansoniin infection in children, as measured by number of eggs per gram in feces, when compared with placebo (87495). However, supplementation with zinc does not appear to reduce the intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichiuris trichura, nor Giardia lamblia infection in children (6586). Furthermore, preliminary clinical research suggests that supplementation with zinc may increase the duration of Entamoeba histolytica infection in children (87099).\n\nThere are also inconsistent results regarding the effects of zinc in PREVENTING intestinal parasite infections. Some clinical research shows that taking zinc in combination with vitamin A reduces the incidence of Giardia lamblia infections when compared with placebo (87099). However, zinc supplementation does not appear to prevent intestinal infections by Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma haematobium, nor Schistosoma mansoniin (87099, 87495).\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for patients on hemodialysis who have resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).\nZinc deficiency is thought to play a role in ESA-resistant anemia in patients with kidney failure. A small clinical trial in patients on hemodialysis with low zinc levels shows that taking zinc acetate hydrate, usually 25mg or 50 mg daily, for 12 months increases plasma levels of zinc and modestly reduces the required weekly dose of ESAs when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on hemoglobin levels (109781).\nless\nLeukemia. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for improving weight maintenance in children and adolescents with leukemia.\nA small clinical study in children and adolescents with acute leukemia shows that taking zinc 2 mg/kg (as an amino acid salt) in two divided doses daily for 60 days doubles weight gain and reduces infection rate by approximately 60% when compared with placebo. However, zinc supplementation does not appear to improve nutritional status (90204).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for lichen planus.\nA small clinical study in adults with oral lichen planus shows that taking zinc 25 mg twice daily for 8 weeks in combination with topical corticosteroid treatment does not improve pain or lesion severity compared with corticosteroid treatment alone (117072). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nIn patients treated for hepatitis C, the presence of hepatic fibrosis increases the risk for development of HCC, and is also associated with low plasma zinc levels. In a retrospective analysis of patients with a sustained virological response to hepatitis C therapy, those taking oral zinc supplements for at least 6 months had approximately half the risk of developing HCC when compared with those not taking zinc. Maintaining a serum zinc level above 90 mcg/dL seems to reduce the risk for HCC (106904).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if increased dietary zinc intake is beneficial for reducing the risk of lung cancer.\nPopulation research suggests that the highest dietary intake of zinc is associated with a 32% reduced risk of lung cancer when compared with the lowest intake (106235). Additionally, another large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of 12.2 years suggests that dietary intake of zinc is protective against lung cancer, with the highest quartile of dietary intake showing the greatest benefit. However, this protective effect was not found for supplemental intake of zinc (112096).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for infertility in males.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate 66 mg daily increases sperm count, testosterone levels, and the incidence of pregnancy in idiopathic infertile men with low testosterone levels (9334, 87430). Another clinical study shows that taking zinc sulfate 66 mg daily can improve sperm morphology by approximately 33% when compared to baseline in men with a grade III varicocele (90194). However, not all research agrees. One clinical study shows that taking elemental zinc 30 mg with folic acid 5 mg daily for 6 months does not improve sperm morphology or pregnancy rates when compared with placebo in infertile men (102085). It is possible the lower dose used in this study was insufficient to produce the beneficial effects observed in earlier research.\n\nZinc supplementation has also been studied as part of combination therapy. A retrospective study in males with or without varicocele-related infertility has found that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine fumarate 1725 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg, vitamin C 90 mg, coenzyme Q10 20 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, selenium 0.05 mg, and vitamin B12 0.015 mg (Proxeed Plus, Sigma-Tau) orally twice daily for 6 months improves sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility when compared with baseline. Improvements in semen parameters were greatest in subjects with more severe varicoceles. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (111296).\n\nThere is also interest in using zinc to improve results of in vitro fertilization (IVF). A small clinical study in couples undergoing IVF suggests that infertile male partners who take a specific combination product (Menevit) containing zinc and other antioxidants seem to have an increased rate of viable pregnancies when compared with placebo (87087). However, it's unclear if the benefit can be attributed to zinc, other antioxidants, or the combination.\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if topical zinc reduces melasma severity.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a topical solution containing zinc sulfate 10% once daily for 2 months is less effective at reducing melasma severity when compared with hydroquinone 4% (90232).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral zinc improves sexual function after menopause.\nA single clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 110 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly improves testosterone levels and sexual function, including desire, arousal, satisfaction, and pain, after menopause when compared with placebo (106228).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with migraine.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with migraine show that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg or zinc gluconate 15 mg daily for 8-12 weeks modestly reduces migraine severity and frequency when compared with placebo (104040, 105684). Both studies were conducted in Iran; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nNasopharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with this type of cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer shows that zinc supplementation 75 mg daily for 2 months may improve disease-free survival rates after 5 years when compared with placebo (87163).\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for neonatal jaundice.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of oral zinc in infants with hyperbilirubinemia. Two small clinical studies in infants with idiopathic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia show that receiving oral zinc sulfate 5 mg twice daily for 5-7 days does not affect levels of total bilirubin, the required duration of phototherapy, or the duration of hospitalization, when compared with placebo (90212, 104814). However, a larger clinical trial in preterm infants receiving phototherapy and zinc 1.2 mg/kg daily as zinc sulfate heptahydrate, via either orogastric or nasogastric tube for 10 days, serum bilirubin levels were modestly decreased only on days 8-10 when compared with phototherapy alone (106242). Additionally, a second larger clinical trial in infants with idiopathic hyperbilirubinemia shows that receiving oral zinc sulfate (Zinc sulfate, Ramofarmin Company) 1 mg/kg daily for 3 days reduces total bilirubin levels and duration of phototherapy when compared with placebo; additionally length of hospitalization is reduced by less than 1 day (115631). The reason for these discrepant findings is unclear but may be attributed to variations in baseline characteristics, treatment duration, and dose.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that following a calorie-restricted diet and taking zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces certain liver enzymes, but does not improve steatosis or reduce weight, when compared with taking placebo and following a calorie-restricted diet (104046).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of zinc is associated with a 42% decreased odds of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (87048).\nless\nObesity. Small studies suggest that oral zinc does not reduce weight or calorie intake in people with overweight or obesity.\nA very small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking supplemental zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), calorie intake, or macronutrient intake when compared with placebo (112471). Additionally, clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking zinc gluconate 25 mg and L-selenomethionine 200 mcg once daily for 8 weeks does not improve BMI, total body fat, or fat free mass when compared with placebo (111448).\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral zinc reduces symptoms in patients with OCD.\nA small clinical study in patients with OCD shows that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg twice daily with fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the severity of OCD symptoms when compared with taking placebo with fluoxetine (90223).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical zinc prevents oral mucositis due to chemotherapy. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral zinc might prevent mucositis due to radiotherapy.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with leukemia and other cancers shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg three times daily for 14 days or until the end of chemotherapy treatment reduces oral mucositis and pain intensity when compared with placebo (90191, 98132). However, smaller doses have not shown benefit. A small clinical study in children and adolescents with leukemia shows that taking zinc 2 mg/kg daily (up to 60 mg daily) in two divided doses does not affect chemotherapy-induced mucositis when compared with placebo (90204). An unblinded clinical study in children and adolescents aged 8-16 years with recently diagnosed leukemia shows that taking zinc gluconate 50 mg (7 mg elemental zinc) daily does not significantly reduce the incidence or duration of oral mucositis when compared with a control group not receiving zinc (104816). Zinc also doesn't seem to be beneficial with high-dose chemotherapy. A small clinical study in adolescents and adults receiving high-dose chemotherapy prior to undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) suggests that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg elemental zinc) twice daily, beginning one day prior to the chemotherapy regimen and continuing for 3 weeks, does not affect the severity, duration, or onset of mucositis when compared with placebo (90215). Other preliminary clinical research in children aged 3-18 years receiving chemotherapy for leukemia or other cancer also shows that taking zinc 1 mg/kg orally daily for 14 days, beginning on the first day of chemotherapy, does not reduce the incidence or severity of mucositis when compared with placebo (111447).\n\nTopical zinc has also been investigated for radiation-induced or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. In two clinical studies, using 7.5 mL of a mouthwash containing zinc chloride 0.2% twice for 2 minutes every 8 hours for 3 weeks modestly reduces the incidence and severity of oral mucositis, and improves quality of life, when compared with a placebo mouthwash (106232, 109690). In one study, the average patient weight was higher in the group using the mouthwash containing zinc (106232). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment, consisting of at least 30 Gy radiation exposure shows that using zinc sulfate 1% mouthwash, 5 mL three times daily for 6 weeks, beginning on the first day of radiation therapy, moderately improves oral mucositis severity and pain scores when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% or placebo mouthwash (111291).\n\nTaking zinc orally might be beneficial in radiation-induced oral mucositis. A small clinical study in patients with head and neck tumors shows that taking zinc sulfate, providing 150 mg elemental zinc, daily starting at the first day of radiation therapy and ending at 6 weeks, reduces the severity of mucositis and prolongs the onset of mucositis when compared with placebo (86981). Another clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking zinc sulfate 150 mg daily during and after chemoradiotherapy treatment, consisting of a total 69.5 Gy radiation exposure and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly, is associated with less severe mucositis when compared with placebo (105677).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves bone density in patients with osteoporosis.\nPopulation research has found that reduced zinc intake and lower zinc serum levels seem to be associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) (6920, 14410). In elderly patients with at least marginal zinc deficiency who are taking standard therapy for osteoporosis, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc acetate dihydrate (Nobelzin, Nobelpharma) providing elemental zinc 25 mg twice daily for 12 months increases BMD when compared with baseline. Increases in serum zinc were associated with improvements in BMD. However, it is unclear if increases in BMD were significant when compared with placebo (106230). It is also unclear if zinc improves BMD in patients without zinc deficiency. A small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal adults suggests that taking zinc in combination with copper, manganese, and calcium might slow bone loss when compared with placebo (1994). It is not clear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces overall mortality in young children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc in daily doses of at least 10 mg reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 16% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation. The risk of mortality was reduced by 54% when children took zinc for up to one year, but overall mortality was not reduced in studies lasting at least one year (106239).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a combination supplement containing zinc 3.75 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation when compared with placebo (111708).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with PCOS.\nA small clinical study in adults taking metformin for PCOS shows that also taking zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg elemental zinc) daily for 8 weeks improves hair loss and facial growth, but not acne, when compared with placebo (96071).\nless\nPostoperative sore throat. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for postoperative sore throat.\nClinical research shows that dissolving a lozenge containing zinc 40 mg as zinc sulfate in the mouth in the 30 minutes before surgery involving endotracheal intubation reduces the incidence of postoperative sore throat by 58% when compared with placebo lozenges. It also seems to reduce the severity of postoperative sore throat that does occur (97138). Other clinical research in adults undergoing a procedure that required endotracheal intubation shows that using a preoperative 30-mL gargle containing zinc 40 mg does not affect sore throat scores when compared with magnesium sulphate 250 mg or budesonide 200 mcg gargles (114763).\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral zinc prevents postpartum depression after a Cesarean section (C-section).\nA small observational study in pregnant patients with anemia who underwent C-section has found that taking zinc sulfate 100 mg daily for 4 days after surgery is associated with a 75% reduction in the odds of developing postpartum depression when compared with no supplementation (109452).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms of PMS.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in adults with PMS shows that taking zinc 30-50 mg daily for 12-24 weeks modestly improves self-reported physical and psychological symptoms, including anger, anxiety, apathy, concentration, insomnia, hypersomnia, and overeating when compared with placebo (117073). The validity of the analyses is limited by heterogeneity. Additionally, the majority of the studies were small and conducted in Iran which may limit generalizability of results to other regions and populations.\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces the risk of preterm labor.\nObservational research has found that low dietary intake of zinc during pregnancy is associated with an increased likelihood of preterm deliveries (87471). Also, most meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking zinc supplements during pregnancy modestly reduces the risk of preterm birth (106231). However, one large meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies shows that zinc supplementation during pregnancy seems to have little or no benefit for reducing the risk of preterm birth when compared with control (105679). Zinc supplementation also does not seem to reduce the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, spontaneous abortion, or premature rupture of membranes (97142, 105679, 106231).\nless\nProstatitis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis.\nA clinical study in men with chronic prostatitis shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg daily along with prazosin 2 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve difficulty urinating or quality of life, but does seem to improve pain, when compared with prazosin alone (90210). The validity of this study was limited by a significant dropout rate.\nless\nPruritus. There is limited evidence on the oral use of zinc for reducing pruritis in hemodialysis patients.\nA small clinical study in end-stage renal disease patients with hemodialysis-associated pruritus shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily for 2 months reduces pruritus severity when compared with placebo (90218).\nless\nPsoriatic arthritis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves psoriatic arthritis symptoms.\nTwo small clinical trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis show that taking zinc orally, alone or in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), does not seem to reduce pain or improve function when compared with control (6514, 6515).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces respiratory tract infections in children.\nAn open-label study in children aged 6 months to 5 years with zinc deficiency shows that taking zinc sulfate 20 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks reduces the number of episodes and the mean duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections over 6 months of follow-up when compared with the 6 months prior to zinc supplementation (104815). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRosacea. It is unclear of oral zinc improves symptoms of rosacea or quality of life.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 440 mg in two divided doses daily for 90 days does not improve quality of life or symptoms associated with rosacea when compared with placebo (90195).\nless\nSeizures. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces recurrent febrile seizures in children.\nAlthough some individual preliminary clinical research disagrees (96069), a meta-analysis of generally low-quality research in children under 5 years of age with a previous febrile seizure shows that taking zinc sulfate 1-2 mg/kg or 20 mg daily for 6-12 months does not reduce febrile seizure recurrence when compared with placebo (106237). Also, a small clinical study shows that taking zinc does not increase the time to first febrile seizure recurrence (96069).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in pediatric or adult patients with sepsis.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of sepsis mortality by 57% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation (106239). Also, a small clinical study in newborns with sepsis shows that giving zinc sulfate monohydrate 3 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days along with antibiotics reduces the likelihood of neurological abnormalities, such as those related to posture, behavior, and reflexes, by 70% when compared with antibiotics alone. Mortality and length of hospital stay were not improved, but the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in these parameters (96077). Another study in preterm infants with late-onset sepsis (developing at least 72 hours after birth), shows that giving 1.4 mg/kg elemental zinc daily orally for 10 days in addition to antibiotics reduces the number of infants with unresolved sepsis at 10 days, and reduces C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, when compared with giving antibiotics alone (104819). A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in infants less than 4 months old shows that administering zinc 1-3 mg/kg daily for 1-18 weeks may reduce the rate of infant mortality and treatment failure when compared with placebo or control, but does not seem to prevent sepsis or improve sepsis-related mortality (108444).\n\nAdditionally, zinc has been evaluated in adults. A single-center observational study in adults with sepsis found that administering zinc orally or enterally in various doses, ranging from less than 15 mg to greater than 50 mg daily, does not improve survival rates or reduce the length of stay in the intensive care unit (115630).\nless\nShigellosis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with acute shigellosis from food poisoning.\nA small clinical study in malnourished children with acute shigellosis (food poisoning) shows that administering a multivitamin syrup containing elemental zinc 20 mg daily for 2 weeks, in addition to standard treatment, can improve recovery time and reduce the number of diarrhea episodes when compared with multivitamin syrup without elemental zinc (87088).\nless\nSleep deprivation. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of zinc 90 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not change sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue when compared with placebo (113655).\nless\nSubstance use disorder. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for substance use disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with opioid use disorder that were being treated with methadone shows that taking zinc sulfate, containing 12 mg zinc, orally daily for 3 months moderately improves relapse prevention scores, including drug use and drug craving scores, when compared with control. Taking zinc also modestly improved stress and anxiety scores (111293).\nless\nTonsillopharyngitis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with tonsillopharyngitis.\nA moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in pediatric patients aged 3 to 10 years with acute tonsillopharyngitis shows that taking a specific combination solution (PediaFlù, Pediatrica S.r.l.) containing zinc (age dependent doses ranging from 2 to 4 mg), honey, propolis, and pelargonium sidoides daily for 6 days along with standard of care reduces tonsilitis severity scores when compared with standard care alone; however, this improvement is not clinically significant. (115632). It is not clear if these effects are due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). There is limited evidence on the parenteral use of zinc for closed head injury.\nA small clinical study shows that administering zinc parenterally immediately following severe closed head injury seems to improve the rate of neurological recovery when compared with standard therapy (2696).\nless\nTuberculosis. It is unclear if oral zinc can improve outcomes in patients receiving tuberculosis treatment.\nLow levels of zinc are common in patients with tuberculosis. In patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis and using anti-tuberculosis treatment, some clinical research shows that taking zinc 50 mg daily as zinc sulfate for 6 months increases the number of patients with negative sputum smears by 50% to 80% within the first 6 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. However, there were no differences in the number of patients with negative smears after this time point. There were also improvements in some liver function enzyme levels after 2 months, but not 6 months, when compared with placebo (106238). However, other clinical research shows that taking zinc 15-90 mg daily for 2-6 months does not improve cure rates or sputum smear conversions when compared with placebo. However, when combined with vitamin A, serum levels of vitamin A, zinc, and hemoglobin were modestly improved and there was a modest increase in sputum smear conversions (109754).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with UTI.\nA low-quality, clinical study in children aged 3-12 years hospitalized for a UTI and receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment shows that taking zinc 1 mg/kg daily for 14 days reduces the duration of dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency when compared with intravenous antibiotics alone. Zinc does not improve fever or the time to negative urine culture (96081). However, this study did not demonstrate that treatment groups were equal at baseline.\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. It is unclear if oral or topical zinc is beneficial for leg ulcer healing.\nTwo small studies in elderly patients with leg ulcers suggest that using a zinc saline solution on a wound dressing or applying zinc oxide to a dressing might improve healing of leg ulcers (2694, 6901). However, oral zinc supplementation does not seem to be beneficial. A meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with venous leg ulcers shows that taking zinc orally does not improve healing when compared with placebo (104079).\nless\nVertigo. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL shows that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 7.5 mg, alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg, piperine 1 mg, cholecalciferol 800 units, vitamin B2 0.8 mg, and vitamin B6 1 mg (Vertistop D, Difass) orally daily for 6 months moderately reduces the number of vertigo relapse episodes when compared with control. However, in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than 20 ng/mL that took a specific combination product containing zinc 7.5 mg, alanine 600 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg and piperine 1 mg (Vertistop L, Difass) orally daily for 6 months there was no difference in relapse episodes when compared with control (111294). It is unclear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWater warts. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for the treatment of water warts in children.\nIn children with water warts, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate heptahydrate (as Zinco syrup) for 2 months results in lesion resolution in 70% of patients when compared with baseline. Lesion resolution occurred in an additional 13% of patients in the month after treatment completion, with no recurrence in any of these children over the next 9 months. Zinc 3 mg daily was used in children up to 3 years of age, and 5 mg daily was used in older children (106234). Due to the lack of a comparator group, it is unclear if these outcomes are due to zinc or the natural resolution of the condition.\nless\nWound healing. Topical zinc might be beneficial for the healing of uncomplicated wounds.\nA small clinical study shows that applying zinc chloride solution, standardized to contain zinc 20 mcg/mL, twice daily improves wound healing when compared with saline solution in patients with uncomplicated, skin wounds. However, when zinc is administered as a component of an insulin product (Humulin, Eli Lilly and Company), it seems to be more effective than zinc chloride alone (90192).\nless\nWrinkled skin. Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA topical preparation containing 10% vitamin C as L-ascorbic acid and acetyl tyrosine, zinc sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, and bioflavonoids (Cellex-C High Potency Serum) applied to photo-aged facial skin for 3 months seems to improve fine and coarse wrinkling, yellowing and sallowness, roughness, and skin tone when compared with placebo (6155).\nless\nFecal incontinence. Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with fecal incontinence shows that topically applying an ointment containing zinc sulfate 1% and aluminum sulfate 5% to the anal canal mucosa three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms approximately twice as much as a placebo ointment. Quality of life related to the incontinence also improved (90219).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate zinc for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nFor adults, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of zinc has been established. The daily RDAs are as follows: females 18 years of age, 9 mg; females 19 years and older, 8 mg; males 18 years and older, 11 mg. During pregnancy, 13 mg in those 18 years of age, 11 mg in those 19 years and older. During lactation, 17 mg in those 18 years of age; 12 mg in those 19 years and older (7135).\n\nZinc supplements are often used to treat sequelae of zinc deficiency. For other uses, see Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nZinc binds to proteins, becoming available for absorption as the protein is digested (7135). The type of protein influences how much zinc is absorbed. Animal proteins generally enhance zinc absorption, while plant proteins like soy might reduce zinc absorption (7135, 11672, 11673, 11675). It is not known whether high-protein diets influence zinc balance in adults.Phytates in food can reduce the amount of zinc absorbed from foods. Phytate is found in grains (e.g., maize, corn, sorghum), legumes, seeds (e.g., sunflower, pumpkin), and soy (7135, 11673, 11680). It forms non-absorbable complexes with zinc. The absorption-inhibiting effect of phytate can be prevented by the presence of phytases, food processing (e.g. fermentation, germination, soaking, milling, and heat), amino acids in animal proteins, and higher zinc intake (1858, 7135, 11617, 11673, 11679).\nTopical:\nZinc has been used in various formulations, including lotions, gels, ointments, mouth rinses, and others. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nThe adequate intake (AI) of zinc for infants up to 6 months of age is 2 mg daily (7135). For older infants and children, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of zinc is based on age as follows: 7 months to 3 years, 3 mg; 4-8 years, 5 mg; 9-13 years, 8 mg; females 14-18 years, 9 mg; males 14-18 years, 11 mg.\n\nZinc supplements are often used to treat sequelae of zinc deficiency. For other uses in children, see Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nDifferent salt forms provide different amounts of elemental zinc. Zinc sulfate contains 23% elemental zinc; 220 mg zinc sulfate contains 50 mg zinc. Zinc gluconate contains 14.3% elemental zinc; 10 mg zinc gluconate contains 1.43 mg zinc (506).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nAMILORIDE (Midamor)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nAmiloride can modestly reduce zinc excretion and increase zinc levels.\nClinical research shows that amiloride can reduce urinary zinc excretion, especially at doses of 10 mg per day or more. This zinc-sparing effect can help to counteract zinc losses caused by thiazide diuretics, but it is unlikely to cause zinc toxicity at usual amiloride doses (830, 11626, 11627, 11634). The other potassium-sparing diuretics, spironolactone (Aldactone) and triamterene (Dyrenium), do not seem to have a zinc-sparing effect.\nless\nATAZANAVIR (Reyataz)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nZinc modestly reduces levels of atazanavir, although this effect does not seem to be clinically significant.\nClinical research shows that zinc might decrease serum atazanavir levels by chelating with atazanavir in the gut and preventing its absorption (93578). Although a single dose of zinc sulfate (Solvazinc tablets) 125 mg orally does not affect atazanavir concentrations in patients being treated with atazanavir/ritonavir, co-administration of zinc sulfate 125 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces plasma levels of atazanavir by about 22% in these patients. However, despite this decrease, atazanavir levels still remain at high enough concentrations for the prevention of HIV virus replication (90216).\nless\nBICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, zinc might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption.\nAdvise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after zinc containing products (116930).\nless\nCEPHALEXIN (Keflex)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nZinc might decrease cephalexin levels by chelating with cephalexin in the gut and preventing its absorption.\nA pharmacokinetic study shows that zinc sulfate 250 mg taken concomitantly with cephalexin 500 mg decreases peak levels of cephalexin by 31% and reduces the exposure to cephalexin by 27%. Also, taking zinc sulfate 3 hours before cephalexin decreases peak levels of cephalexin by 11% and reduces the exposure to cephalexin by 18%. By decreasing cephalexin levels, zinc might increase the risk of treatment failure. This effect does not occur when zinc is taken 3 hours after the cephalexin dose (94163). To avoid an interaction, advise patients take zinc sulfate 3 hours after taking cephalexin.\nless\nCISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, zinc might interfere with the therapeutic effects of cisplatin.\nAnimal research suggests that zinc stimulates tumor cell production of the protein metallothionein, which binds and inactivates cisplatin (11624, 11625). It is not known whether zinc supplements or high dietary zinc intake can cause clinically significant interference with cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin might also increase zinc excretion.\nless\nINTEGRASE INHIBITORS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, taking zinc along with integrase inhibitors might decrease the levels and clinical effects of these drugs.\nZinc is a divalent cation. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that other divalent cations such as calcium and iron can decrease blood levels of the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir through chelation (93578, 93579).\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nZinc might reduce the levels and clinical effects of penicillamine.\nBy forming an insoluble complex with penicillamine, zinc interferes with penicillamine absorption and activity. Zinc supplements reduce the efficacy of low-dose penicillamine (0.5-1 gram/day), but do not seem to affect higher doses (1-2.75 gram/day), provided dosing times are separated (2678, 4534, 11605). Advise patients to take zinc and penicillamine at least 2 hours apart.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nZinc can decrease the levels and clinical effects of quinolones antibiotics.\nQuinolones form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing absorption of both the quinolone and zinc if taken at the same time (828, 2682, 3046, 11600). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements.\nless\nRITONAVIR (Norvir)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nZinc modestly reduces levels of ritonavir.\nClinical research shows that zinc might reduce serum ritonavir levels by chelating with ritonavir in the gut and preventing its absorption (93578). In patients with HIV, ritonavir is taken with atazanavir to prevent the metabolism and increase the effects of atazanavir. A pharmacokinetic study shows that, in patients being treated with atazanavir/ritonavir, co-administration of zinc sulfate (Solvazinc tablets) 125 mg as a single dose or as multiple daily doses for 2 weeks reduces plasma levels of ritonavir by about 16% (90216). However, atazanavir levels still remains high enough to prevent HIV virus replication. Therefore, the decrease in ritonavir levels is not likely to be clinically significant.\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nZinc might reduce levels of tetracycline antibiotics.\nTetracyclines form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which can reduce absorption of both the tetracycline and zinc when taken at the same time (3046, 4945). Taking zinc sulfate 200 mg with tetracycline reduces absorption of the antibiotic by 30% to 40% (11615). Demeclocycline and minocycline cause a similar interaction (4945). However, doxycycline does not seem to interact significantly with zinc (11615). Advise patients to take tetracyclines at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements to avoid any interactions.\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBETA-CAROTENE\nZinc might reduce levels of beta-carotene.\nClinical research suggests that high doses of zinc supplements (600 mg/day) can decrease serum carotene levels (87325).\nless\nBROMELAIN\nTheoretically, zinc might reduce the effects of bromelain.\nTheoretically, metal ions such as zinc might inhibit the enzymatic activity of bromelain (11). However, there are no clinical reports of this interaction.\nless\nCALCIUM\nCalcium supplements might decrease dietary zinc absorption.\nCalcium usually does not have a clinically significant effect on zinc balance (989, 7135, 7555). However, in patients at high risk for zinc insufficiency, this interaction can be avoided by taking calcium supplements at bedtime instead of with meals (11590).\nless\nCHROMIUM\nChromium and zinc might impact each other's absorption.\nLaboratory research suggests that chromium and zinc share a transport site in the intestine, and each could reduce the absorption of the other (1950). This is not likely to be clinically significant at normal supplemental doses of zinc and chromium.\nless\nCOFFEE\nCoffee might reduce zinc absorption.\nTaking zinc sulfate 220 mg with black coffee instead of water reduces zinc absorption by 50% (11664). The constituent of coffee causing this interaction, and the clinical significance, are not known.\nless\nCOPPER\nZinc can reduce the absorption of copper.\nLarge amounts of zinc can decrease copper retention and competitively inhibit copper absorption (706, 707, 2693, 24329, 45976). Toxic levels of zinc intake can cause significant copper deficiency and associated anemia (706, 11591, 112473). Some signs of copper deficiency have also occurred in adults and infants taking zinc 150 mg or more daily for up to 2 years (2677).\nless\nEDTA\nEDTA might increase urinary zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nEDTA and its salts chelate metal ions, including zinc. Repeated infusions of high doses of EDTA, as used in chelation therapy, can increase urinary zinc excretion 10- to 25-fold and reduce serum zinc levels by up to 40% (5749, 9630, 11670, 11671). Symptoms of zinc depletion have been reported, even when supplemental zinc in doses of 15mg daily was used (11671). Monitor patients receiving repeated infusions of EDTA closely for symptoms of zinc depletion.\nless\nFOLIC ACID\nFolic acid might impact zinc absorption.\nThe evidence on the interaction between folic acid supplements and dietary zinc absorption is conflicting (9389, 9390, 9391, 9392, 9393, 9421). Normal supplemental doses of folic acid are not likely to affect zinc balance in people with adequate dietary zinc intake (7135, 9391).\nless\nIP-6 (Phytic acid)\nPhytic acid might reduce zinc absorption.\nPhytic acid found naturally in foods can bind zinc and reduce its absorption (87206); however this interaction is modified by several other dietary factors. Symptomatic zinc deficiency due to high dietary phytic acid levels has not been reported in Western populations. The effect on zinc of increasing phytic acid intake with IP-6 supplements is not known. Avoid IP-6 supplements in people with other risk factors for zinc deficiency (1858).\nless\nIRON\nIron and zinc can interfere with each other's absorption.\nWhen high supplemental doses of zinc are taken on an empty stomach there is a measurable reduction in iron absorption. High supplemental doses of non-heme iron taken on an empty stomach can reduce zinc absorption, especially when dietary mineral intake is low (8856, 9579, 9580, 9581, 9582, 9583, 9584). This is probably because the carriers for iron and zinc in the gut become saturated at high doses, and the ions then compete for non-specific carriers. If one of the ions is present in excess, absorption of the other will be decreased (9580). When food is present, the ions become complexed with food components and do not compete for absorption (7357, 9579). Therefore, there is not a significant interaction between dietary iron and zinc, or between supplemental iron and zinc when taken with food (8866, 9579, 9581). Advise patients to take these supplements with food.\nless\nMAGNESIUM\nMagnesium and zinc can interfere with each other's absorption.\nHigh doses of zinc supplements (142 mg/day), or high dietary zinc intake (53mg/day) seem to decrease magnesium balance (9624, 12424). This may be due to competition between zinc and magnesium for transport systems in the intestine. Conversely, high intakes of magnesium might enhance binding of zinc to dietary phytic acid, reducing its absorption (11617). The clinical significance of these effects isn't clear.\nless\nMANGANESE\nZinc might increase the absorption of manganese.\nPreliminary data suggests zinc supplements more than double the amount of manganese absorbed from supplements taken under fasting conditions (2000). The clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nless\nRIBOFLAVIN\nRiboflavin might improve zinc absorption, although the clinical significance is unclear.\nPreliminary data suggests riboflavin and its active form, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), improve zinc absorption. It is suggested that they form a complex with zinc, keeping it in solution in the gut, and acting as a carrier across the intestinal wall (11601). The clinical significance of this is not clear.\nless\nVITAMIN A\nZinc might increase vitamin A absorption.\nClinical evidence suggests that zinc supplements can increase plasma levels of retinol (8636, 24333, 86920, 87307). Significant increases have occurred with doses of up to 30 mg daily in children and adults (86920, 24333).\nless\nVITAMIN D\nVitamin D might alter absorption of zinc, although the clinical significance is unclear.\nPreliminary data suggests vitamin D is involved in zinc absorption (11602). However, data is conflicting on whether vitamin D supplements improve zinc absorption (11603, 11604).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nALCOHOL USE DISORDER\nLong-term excessive alcohol consumption is associated with impaired zinc absorption and increased excretion of zinc in the urine (7135).\nless\nBARIATRIC SURGERY\nBariatric surgery reduces zinc absorption and can cause zinc insufficiency despite zinc supplementation. A small prospective observational study shows that the roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) reduce zinc absorption by 52% and 72%, respectively, at 2 years after surgery. About 15% of SG patients and 38% of RYGBP patients still had low levels of zinc at 2 years after surgery, despite adequate dietary zinc consumption along with 15-25 mg daily zinc supplementation (105685).\nless\nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nLow dietary zinc intake is associated with a greater chance of developing chronic kidney disease (104050). Furthermore, patients with chronic kidney disease who are receiving hemodialysis are at greater risk for zinc deficiency. Zinc supplementation may be needed in these patients (11053).\nless\nCOPPER DEFICIENCY\nExcess supplemental zinc intake upregulates copper binding protein metallothionein in the intestine, leading to copper deficiency. People with pre-existing copper deficiency or risk factors for copper deficiency such as Menkes disease, hypoceruloplasminemia, gastrointestinal surgery, diseases of malabsorption, or malnutrition may be at increased risk (112473).\nless\nVEGETARIANISM\nVegetarian diets are often high in grains and legumes, and therefore high in phytate. Zinc absorption from a vegetarian diet is likely to be reduced, making this type of diet a risk factor for zinc depletion (2677, 7135, 11677). However, the body adapts over the long-term, becoming more efficient at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc losses in bile and intestinal secretions. Zinc plasma levels are generally at the lower end of the normal range in people who follow a vegetarian diet (11677).\nless",

            "Nutrient Depletions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCAPTOPRIL (Capoten)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCaptopril might increase urinary zinc excretion and decrease zinc levels.\nSome data suggest captopril increases urinary zinc excretion, possibly due to chelation of zinc by sulfhydryl groups (25, 26, 6543, 11619, 11620, 98997). Some studies have found a link between captopril, low zinc levels, and taste loss which can be reversed with zinc supplements, while others have not (6543, 11618, 11619, 11620, 11621). Differences may be due to dose and duration of captopril therapy - increased zinc losses seem more likely with high captopril doses (greater than 150 mg/day) taken for several weeks or months (6543, 11618, 11619, 11620). Routine zinc supplements aren't necessary with captopril. Monitor for symptoms of zinc depletion in patients on high doses of captopril for prolonged periods, especially if they have other risk factors. Significant zinc depletion doesn't occur with enalapril (25, 26), and is unlikely with other ACE inhibitors (98997).\nless\nCHOLESTYRAMINE (Questran)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCholestyramine might modestly reduce zinc absorption and zinc levels.\nLimited animal research suggests cholestyramine might reduce zinc absorption (9566); however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nless\nCISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCisplatin might increase urinary zinc excretion and temporarily reduce zinc levels.\nLimited research suggests that an acute increase in urinary zinc excretion occurs after a dose of cisplatin. Plasma zinc levels are sometimes reduced, but usually return to normal within 24-48 hours (11622, 11623). Supplements aren't routinely necessary.\nless\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCorticosteroids might modestly reduce zinc levels.\nThe pituitary-adrenal axis seems to play a role in control of serum zinc levels (11606, 11608, 11611). There's some evidence that disruption of this axis by single large doses of corticosteroids (equivalent to 50 mg prednisone or higher), or therapy with lower doses for several months, can cause a reduction in serum zinc levels (11606, 11607, 11608, 11610, 11611). This may reflect redistribution of zinc into the tissues, although increased urinary excretion has also been reported (11609). Zinc supplements aren't routinely necessary with corticosteroid therapy. Monitor patients closely if they have additional risk factors for zinc deficiency.\nless\nDEFEROXAMINE (Desferal)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nDeferoxamine increases urinary zinc excretion and might decrease zinc levels.\nClinical research shows that deferoxamine increases urinary zinc excretion in a dose-dependent manner (6597, 11629, 11630, 11631). The effect on serum and blood cell levels of zinc is variable. In some people they remain normal, presumably due to compensatory mechanisms, while in others they are low (6597, 11631). Symptomatic zinc deficiency due to deferoxamine is rare, although visual and hearing loss corrected by zinc supplements has been reported (11628). Monitor patients taking deferoxamine for signs of zinc deficiency and give supplements if necessary.\nless\nDEXRAZOXANE (Zinecard)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nDexrazoxane might increase urinary zinc excretion and decrease zinc levels.\nPreliminary data indicate dexrazoxane increases urinary zinc excretion 10-fold (11632). Dexrazoxane is a derivative of EDTA and can chelate various metals, including zinc (11633). The clinical significance of this is not known.\nless\nDISULFIRAM (Antabuse)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nA disulfiram metabolite might reduce zinc absorption and zinc levels.\nA metabolite of disulfiram is a chelating agent that binds zinc. Preliminary data suggest that doses of disulfiram up to about 320 mg daily may decrease intestinal zinc absorption, while higher doses of 400 mg daily might increase it slightly (11613, 11635). The clinical significance of this is not clear.\nless\nESTROGENS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nEstrogens might reduce, or have no effect on, zinc levels.\nResearch on the effects of estrogens on plasma zinc levels is conflicting. Some studies report decreased levels, while others show no change (9505, 11642, 11643, 11644, 11645, 11646, 11647, 11648, 11649, 11650, 11651). Estrogen-induced decreases in serum albumin may reduce the amount of zinc carried in the blood. Also, the anabolic effects of estrogens increase protein synthesis and use of zinc as an enzyme cofactor, increasing the amount of zinc taken up and retained by tissues (11642, 11649). There is no reliable evidence that estrogens increase zinc excretion (11642). Therefore, supplements generally are not necessary.\nless\nETHAMBUTOL (Myambutol)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nEthambutol might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nEthambutol chelates zinc and might reduce plasma and tissue levels (4453, 11613, 11640, 11641). This could contribute to ocular side effects of the drug (11613, 11639, 11640). The incidence of visual dysfunction increases with the dose of ethambutol, especially above 25 mg/kg/day, and also seems to be more common in people with low plasma zinc levels less than 0.7 mg/L (4453, 11639, 11640). Counsel patients taking ethambutol to report visual changes, and consider regular monitoring of visual function. Visual changes are usually reversible if the drug is stopped promptly (11640). It is not clear whether zinc supplements are helpful to reduce side effects of ethambutol, and there's some concern that zinc chelation is involved in the mechanism of action of the drug, so taking zinc supplements could reduce its efficacy (11613).\nless\nH2-BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nH2-blockers might modestly reduce zinc absorption and reduce zinc levels.\nLimited data suggest inhibition of gastric acid secretion by H2-blockers might reduce absorption of zinc from supplements (11636), but clinically significant zinc depletion hasn't been reported.\nless\nPANTOPRAZOLE (Protonix)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nPantoprazole might increase zinc excretion; however, it doesn't seem to affect zinc levels.\nEach 40 mg vial of pantoprazole IV contains 1 mg EDTA, which can chelate zinc. This is a very low dose of EDTA compared with those used in EDTA chelation therapy. The manufacturer reports that pantoprazole IV 240 mg daily for 7 days increases urinary zinc excretion, but serum zinc levels are unchanged (11665). Zinc supplements are not usually necessary with typical doses of pantoprazole IV.\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPenicillamine might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nPenicillamine forms chelates with zinc, increasing urinary zinc excretion, but also increasing intestinal zinc absorption (2678, 4534, 9630, 11613). In general, the two effects probably cancel out (11612, 11613). However, there is a case report of severe, symptomatic zinc deficiency after two years of treatment with up to 2 grams/day of penicillamine (11614). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency. If a supplement is necessary, the dose should be separated from penicillamine by 1-2 hours.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nPhenytoin might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nPhenytoin can chelate zinc in vitro and has been associated with both reduced and increased zinc absorption in animals (11613, 11669). Although there are occasional case reports of reduced serum zinc levels in people taking phenytoin, studies have not found a consistent reduction (11577, 11659, 11660, 11663, 11669). Routine zinc supplements are not necessary with phenytoin.\nless\nPROPOFOL (Diprivan)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nEDTA in propofol might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nPropofol infusion contains 0.005% EDTA, which can chelate zinc. Zinc excretion is increased in critically ill patients and is increased about 2-fold more in patients receiving propofol infusions (11666). Serum zinc levels are decreased in critically ill patients and then gradually recover as the patient's condition improves. This recovery is blunted in patients on propofol (11666). It has been suggested that reduced zinc levels in critical illness may reduce the acute inflammatory response to stress, and the effects of zinc supplements in this population aren't fully understood (11666). If patients are on propofol infusions for several days, monitor for symptoms of zinc deficiency and consider supplements if necessary.\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nPPIs might reduce modestly zinc absorption and reduce zinc levels.\nLimited data suggest that inhibition of gastric acid secretion by PPIs might reduce absorption of zinc from supplements (11637). PPIs don't seem to affect zinc absorption from food (11638). Clinically significant zinc depletion has not been reported.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nQuinolones might reduce zinc absorption and reduce zinc levels.\nClinical research shows that quinolones form complexes with dietary and supplemental zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing absorption of both the quinolone and zinc if taken at the same time (828, 2682, 3046, 11600). This isn't likely to cause zinc depletion with normal courses of antibiotic therapy. If zinc supplements are needed for other reasons, advise patients to take quinolones at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after the supplement.\nless\nTETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTetracyclines might reduce zinc absorption and reduce zinc levels.\nClinical research shows that tetracyclines such as tetracycline, demeclocycline, and minocycline, form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which can reduce absorption of both dietary and supplemental zinc (3046, 4945, 11613). Doxycycline doesn't seem to cause this interaction (11615). Advise patients to take tetracyclines at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements. Effects of tetracyclines on dietary zinc absorption aren't likely to be clinically significant except in people with other risk factors for zinc deficiency who take tetracyclines for several months (11613).\nless\nTHIAZIDE DIURETICS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nThiazide diuretics might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nClinical research shows that thiazide diuretics increase urinary zinc excretion by 50% to 60%, and this is likely sustained during at least 3 years of treatment (830, 831, 6570, 11626, 11627, 98997). Decreased serum zinc levels sometimes occur, although they usually remain within the normal range, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms (831, 4452, 11626). However, prolonged thiazide therapy might deplete tissue zinc. It's suggested this could contribute to the impotence sometimes seen with thiazides (830, 4452, 6570, 11627). Monitor patients on long-term thiazide therapy for symptoms of zinc deficiency. Amiloride is zinc-sparing and can counteract zinc losses caused by thiazides (830).\nless\nVALPROATE\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nValproic acid might increase zinc excretion and reduce zinc levels.\nValproic acid might bind zinc. Some researchers suggest this contributes to both its mechanism of action and side effects (11652, 11655, 11656, 11657). Whether valproic acid affects zinc balance in humans is unclear. Some studies have reported reduced serum and tissue zinc levels (11659, 11656), while others have found no change (11658, 11661, 11662). However, epilepsy has also been associated with both increases and decreases in zinc levels (11658, 11660). There are a few case reports of alopecia and skin problems associated with valproic acid therapy which have responded to zinc supplements. The zinc status of these patients prior to starting valproic acid is not clear (11652, 11653, 11654). It's unlikely that valproic acid causes clinically significant zinc deficiency in most patients. Consider supplements only if the patient has other risk factors or shows symptoms of deficiency.\nless\nZIDOVUDINE (Retrovir)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nZidovudine might reduce levels of zinc.\nSome data suggest that zidovudine contributes to the decreased zinc plasma levels associated with AIDS (4531). However, the role of zinc supplementation is controversial. It has been reported that zinc supplements can reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients (6566).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nSymptoms of acute zinc overdose and toxicity may include epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting (116212). Case reports of hyperzincemia describe low copper levels, blood dyscrasias, and neurological problems, including sensory disturbances, numbness, tingling, limb weakness, and difficulty walking (17092, 17093, 90205, 90233, 112473, 116751). Zinc overdose has also been reported to cause acute renal tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis (331, 1352, 87338). In one case report of an acute overdose with tablets providing 4.5 grams of zinc sulfate, acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting was reported. This patient's serum zinc levels remained within the normal range, suggesting limited total zinc absorption (116212).\nTreatment\nAcute zinc overdose may be treated with supportive care. Severe zinc toxicity resulting in hematological abnormalities and/or copper deficiency may require treatment with chelating agents and copper supplementation (116751). One case report describes the use of supportive therapy including antiemetics, fluids, pain management, and proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of acute gastrointestinal symptoms (116212).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbout 15% to 40% of the zinc in foods is absorbed. Bioavailability is influenced by zinc status. Absorption increases in states of zinc deficiency (87122) and if zinc intakes are low (6903, 87123). Zinc is mostly absorbed in the small intestine, particularly the jejunum (7135). In human research, zinc oxide absorption is best in an acidic environment (2809). Zinc acetate is absorbed over a wide pH range and might be a better choice in people with reduced stomach acid (2809). In laboratory research, zinc uptake in human intestinal epithelial cells is similar for zinc chloride, zinc methionine, and zinc propionate (2739). Human research also shows that glycoprotein matrix-bound zinc is more extensively absorbed when compared with zinc oxide (114762).\n\nZinc absorption may be influenced by dietary factors. In humans, diets high in phytate result in a reduced bioavailability of zinc, even during fortification (6903, 87123). Vegetarian diets also result in a decrease in the total amount of zinc absorbed, but these diets are without effect on fractional absorption (87041). However, although zinc absorption may be increased with some protein sources, others, such as bovine serum albumin and soy protein, may reduce its absorption (8866).\nDistribution\nMore than 85% of the total zinc in the body is in skeletal muscle and bone. Plasma zinc is tightly regulated at a concentration of approximately 10 to 15 mcmol/L (7135).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, zinc given intravenously or orally resulted in zinc going rapidly to the liver, followed by two component exponential loss patterns (87351). Plasma levels following intravenous administration decreased to <2% of that injected by 24 hours; following oral administration levels decreased from a maximum of 1.2% of that ingested 3 hours after intake to 0.7% by 24 hours (87351). Over a 5-day period, zinc levels increased in red blood cells to maximum values of 6.4% of injected amounts or 2.4% of ingested amounts (87351).\nExcretion\nMost zinc is excreted in the feces, with a small amount eliminated in the urine (7135, 8631, 87027). However, urinary zinc levels appear to increase in patients with type 2 diabetes and congestive heart failure (87444). During lactation, zinc excretion increases via breast milk. The body seems to compensate for this increased demand by increasing zinc absorption and conserving endogenous zinc (8631).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nZinc is a biologically essential trace element and is the second most abundant trace element in the body. The total body content is about 2 grams (8621). It is a cofactor in many biological processes including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. About 30% of cellular zinc is found within the nucleus. A large number of proteins that play a role in the regulation of gene expression are thought to contain zinc (8619). Zinc also plays a role in immune function, wound healing, reproduction, growth and development, behavior and learning, taste and smell, blood clotting, thyroid hormone function, and insulin action (331). Zinc is found in more than 300 enzymes (8619). About 300 enzymes depend on zinc as a catalyst (7135, 96074). Zinc is also required in hepatic synthesis of retinol binding protein, the transport protein of vitamin A (8630). Without adequate zinc, symptoms of vitamin A deficiency can appear, despite vitamin A supplementation (8630).\n\nMeat, seafood, dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains contain relatively high concentrations of zinc (331). Many breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc (7135). Zinc oxide and zinc sulfate are typically used to fortify wheat products (10668).\n\nZinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, low insulin levels, reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, anorexia, mental lethargy, irritability, low sperm count, generalized hair loss, rough and dry skin, skin lesions, slow wound healing, decreased thyroid function, delayed onset of puberty, poor sense of smell and taste, diarrhea, and nausea (8619). Although zinc deficiency and tri-iodothyronine (T3) have complementary roles in growth and development, growth failure in zinc deficiency does not seem to be the result of impaired T3 function (8619). Zinc deficiency is not uncommon worldwide, but deficiency is rare in the US; most diets provide more than the recommended dietary allowance (8632). Moderate zinc deficiency is associated with malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism, chronic renal disease, and chronic debilitating diseases (8621). Zinc levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia (12584).\n\nThere is no reliable test in clinical use to determine zinc deficiency. Serum or plasma zinc on its own is neither sensitive nor specific. It seems to be useful to measure zinc status on a population basis, but is an inaccurate measure in individuals, particularly in people with chronic infections or inflammatory conditions (8625). The most reliable method for diagnosing marginal zinc deficiency is a positive response to zinc supplementation and improvement in subtle symptoms such as growth retardation or altered ability to taste or smell (8621).\nAnti-gingivitis effects\nMost clinical evidence shows that using zinc toothpaste or mouthwash alone or in combination with triclosan can prevent plaque accumulation, gingivitis, or the formation of calculus (6523, 6524, 6525, 6526, 6527, 6528, 6529, 87418, 87507). It is possible that this is due to antimicrobial effects of zinc (87012, 87217).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIt is hypothesized that low levels of plasma zinc may be one of the nonspecific features of inflammation (87440). In two meta-analyses, zinc supplementation reduced inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6, malondialdehyde, and neutrophils (104820, 104952). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers for atherosclerosis, including hsCRP, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), malondialdehyde and hydroxyalkenals (MDA+HAE) (87214, 96073). Also, zinc supplementation has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP in hemodialysis patients (87171). In addition, zinc supplementation reduces serum immunoglobulins and increases serum albumin, which appears to be associated with reduced joint paint, increased mobility, and decreased joint swelling in patients with psoriatic arthritis (6515). However, taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat rheumatoid arthritis (6517, 6518, 6519, 87406).\n\nTopical zinc might be effective for treating acne (819, 820, 2687, 2688) due to anti-inflammatory activity resulting from inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis induced by decreased granulocyte zinc levels (104056).\nAnti-ulcer effects\nTaking zinc orally seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers in clinical research (6588, 6589, 6590, 6591, 87097, 87285). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, in human research, the antiulcer effects of zinc were suggested to be due to inhibition of gastric secretion as opposed to interactions on parietal cell receptors (87478).\nAntidiabetic effects\nZinc has been shown to decrease blood glucose and increase insulin levels in human studies (86933, 87520), but the mechanism of these effects is unclear. There is some evidence that zinc can increase glucose transport into cells and potentiate insulin-induced glucose transport, possibly by affecting the insulin intracellular signaling (second messenger system) pathway (8620). Zinc has also been shown to increase serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 by 30% and improve glucose tolerance (8624). Additionally, some animal research shows that zinc can prevent renal oxidative and inflammatory damage due to hyperglycemia in a rat model of diabetes, possibly via induced expression of metallothionein and suppressed connective tissue growth factor (87161). These results suggest that zinc's antidiabetic effects may be explained by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Preliminary research also shows that some patients with type 2 diabetes are zinc deficient, possibly as a result of altered zinc metabolism (6531, 6532). Whether zinc deficiency is involved in the development of insulin resistance is unknown. In type 1 diabetes with zinc deficiency, zinc supplementation might reduce lipid peroxidation (6533).\nAntiviral effects\nThe mechanism for the effect of zinc on the common cold is unclear. It does not influence interleukin-8 in nasal secretions, suggesting that zinc does not affect the immune response to colds (10783, 10784). Zinc can inhibit rhinovirus replication in vitro, but it is unclear whether this happens in vivo (10783, 10784, 18216). The rhinovirus replicates in the nasal mucosa, and some researchers question whether orally administered zinc produces sufficient levels in nasal tissues and secretions to inhibit viral replication (8628, 8629). The amount of available ionized zinc varies with different formulations and might influence the effectiveness of zinc for the common cold (336, 340). The addition of flavoring agents such as citric acid, mannitol, or sorbitol to zinc gluconate lozenge preparations decreases the extent of zinc ionization, while the addition of glycine to zinc gluconate lozenges does not (300).\n\nZinc ions might also have effects against other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes virus (6538, 6539, 6541, 18216). In vitro research also shows that high intracellular zinc levels might stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, and zinc is also reported to have a synergistic effect with antivirals (106903).\nBiliary effects\nZinc is thought to be a cofactor for enzymes involved in the metabolism of bilirubin. It has been shown to reduce serum bilirubin levels in animals (104814).\nDermatologic effects\nClinical research suggests that zinc has beneficial effects on the skin when used orally or topically. For example, oral zinc can improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory activity (104056, 106233) and its ability to decrease skin sebum secretion (819, 87275, 87378, 106233). Some research also suggests that zinc has antimicrobial activity against Cutibacterium acnes (106233).\n\nTopical zinc, along with other antioxidants, appears to improve the look of aging skin (6155).\nFertility effects\nMale fertility appears to be influenced by zinc (6573, 6574, 6575, 6576). Infertile males have lower seminal plasma zinc, with normal or reduced blood zinc (6575, 6577). Clinical research suggests that short-term dietary zinc depletion results in reduced serum testosterone concentrations, seminal volume, and total seminal zinc loss per ejaculate (6576). Supplementation with zinc improves sperm parameters in men with reduced sperm mobility (6578). However, excess zinc might reduce sperm motility (6573). In male cigarette smokers with infertility, supplementation with zinc improved sperm quality, possibly by reducing testicular accumulation of cadmium induced by cigarette smoking (86915). In infertile men, zinc improved total sperm count (9334, 87430). Some of the benefits of zinc on fertility may be due to hormonal effects. For example, in human research, zinc increased serum testosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels in some (6708, 87430), but not all (6569, 87095) studies.\nImmunomodulating effects\nZinc is important for neutrophil, natural killer cell, and T-lymphocyte function (6551). Even mild zinc deficiency might adversely affect T-cell functions (6552). Interestingly, high-dose zinc supplementation, 20 times the RDA, can have a negative effect similar to deficiency on immune function (8625). In human research, zinc decreased levels of the suppressor T cells and increased the ratio of helper to suppressor cells (6578, 87156). Zinc, alone or with other micronutrients, has been shown to affect numbers of other CD(+) cells and other lymphocytes, and both increase an decrease levels of cytokines (824, 6555, 6566, 6578, 6596, 10809, 71430, 86910, 87065)(87115, 87140, 87246, 87317, 87414, 87453, 87514).\n\nIn children with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea, zinc has been shown to modulate the innate immune system, as evidenced by an increase in phagocytic activity, a decrease in oxidative burst activity, and an increase in the ratio of naïve to memory T cells (87208). Also, in children with zinc deficiency, daily zinc supplementation seems to increase plasma levels of E. coli-specific IgG (109780). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc supplementation enhanced natural killer cell activity (87273); however, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, zinc decreased natural killer cell activity (6915).\n\nPlasma zinc levels are low in people with HIV infection, but this appears to be a marker of disease progression rather than a treatable cause of progression. Some evidence suggests that zinc supplementation might increase disease progression and mortality in HIV infected patients, but other evidence suggests that avoiding zinc deficiency might allow normal or improved immune function, particularly T-lymphocyte mediated cellular immunity. It also might inhibit susceptibility of T-lymphocytes to apoptosis (8625). More research is needed to tell if zinc should be avoided or prescribed for zinc deficiency in HIV disease.\n\nPlasma levels of zinc are also lower in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). For over 30 years, researchers have been trying to determine the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of MS. Some preliminary clinical research found that zinc levels are reduced during an MS exacerbation and normalize during a remission. However, to date, no clinical research has shown zinc supplementation to be beneficial in patients with MS (97137).\nLipid metabolizing effects\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica is a zinc-deficiency disorder characterized by low plasma levels of zinc and decreased activity of the zinc-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase helps regulate lipid absorption (90933). In patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, zinc supplementation seems to help regulate linoleic acid and serum lipoprotein metabolism (2689).\n\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking zinc sulfate reduces serum cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease (87299). However, in other clinical research, zinc has had mixed effects. For example, in individuals with low baseline cholesterol levels, zinc resulted in increased total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and lacked an effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (86953). In other human research, zinc did not affect total cholesterol levels, but resulted in decreased LDL-cholesterol, and had mixed effects on HDL-cholesterol types, with increased HDL2 and a slight decrease in HDL3 (87306). The mixed effect of zinc on these parameters may be due to dosing, the age and/or sex of the participant, or baseline zinc and/or plasma lipid levels (87193).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using zinc for various neurological conditions. The role of zinc in Alzheimer disease might be both protective and causative. Laboratory studies suggest that zinc might contribute to aggregation of amyloid beta peptide, but protect against subsequent neurotoxicity as an antioxidant (6510, 6511, 6512). Zinc levels and zinc intake appear to be reduced in some people with depression (6562, 90227, 97139). In the human brain, zinc is believed to play a role in the hippocampus in communication between neurons (90221, 97139). Zinc is also believed to potentiate the activity of some antidepressants (90221). Some clinical evidence shows that taking zinc along with antidepressant treatment improves depression scores in patients diagnosed with major depression better than antidepressant alone (86985, 90221).\nOcular effects\nZinc plays a key role in the maintenance of vision. It is present in high concentrations in the eye, particularly in the retina and choroid. Zinc deficiency can alter vision, and severe deficiency causes changes in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Zinc interacts with taurine and vitamin A in the retina, modifies plasma membranes in the photoreceptors, regulates the light-rhodopsin reaction within the photoreceptor, modulates synaptic transmission, and serves as an antioxidant in both the RPE and retina. It seems to slow the progression of some degenerative retinal diseases (8621). Topically, zinc sulfate ophthalmic solution acts as a mild astringent, precipitating protein and clearing mucus from the outer surface of the eye (15).\nProstate cancer effects\nIn some clinical research, taking zinc in combination with other vitamins and minerals reduces the risk of prostate cancer (14135). Also, in laboratory research, zinc has been shown to inhibit prostate carcinoma cell growth (86909). However, other evidence, based on population research, suggests that zinc might adversely affect prostate cancer risk (10306, 15607). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. It has been shown that zinc levels appear to decrease in the prostate tissue and prostatic fluid in men with prostatic carcinoma (6909, 6910). Also, laboratory research suggests that in malignant prostate cells, zinc up-regulated the expression of certain metallothionein (MT)-1 enzymes, as well as genes implicated in oncogenic pathways, such as Fos, Akt1, Jak3, and PI3K (87152). Laboratory research also suggests that zinc induced apoptosis (87490). Other potential mechanisms of action, as shown in laboratory research, include the role of zinc in the regulation of zinc transporters such as LIV-1 (ZUP6) (87267).\nSickle cell effects\nPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are commonly zinc deficient. Zinc deficiency in SCD might cause a cell-mediated immune disorder, and increase the risk of infection in SCD. Some researchers think zinc deficiency leads to increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) which might result in vaso-occlusive pain. This may explain the benefit of zinc supplementation in some patients with SCD (8627).\nSkeletal effects\nThere is interest in using zinc for preventing osteoporosis. Zinc seems to be involved in the mineralization of bone. In animal models, zinc deficiency has been linked to abnormal bone formation. In humans, increased zinc content in bone appears to be associated with increased bone strength (14410). In people with osteoporosis, urinary zinc excretion is increased, possibly as a result of bone resorption (6918). Serum zinc levels and zinc intake seem to be lower in people with osteoporosis (6918, 6920, 14410). However, moderately high dietary zinc intake (53 mg per day) seems to increase magnesium excretion without affecting copper metabolism in postmenopausal adults (12424). Supplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg/day, also appears to decrease magnesium absorption and magnesium balance in healthy adult males (9624). This might adversely affect bone health. Zinc may compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine (12424). More research on the clinical importance of these observations is needed.\nWilson disease\nWilson disease is a condition in which too much copper accumulates in vital organs, including the liver and brain. Zinc blocks copper absorption and increases copper elimination in the stool of people with Wilson disease (2692).\nWound-healing effects\nFor aiding in wound healing, topical zinc might enhance re-epithelialization and collagen synthesis, decrease inflammation, and inhibit bacterial growth (2699)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of zizyphus used traditionally is the fruit (93307). However, the leaves, seeds, and bark have all been examined for medicinal use in laboratory models. The zizyphus fruit contains bioactive phytochemical compounds including fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, polysaccharides, triterpenic acids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, fiber such as pectin, vitamin C, B vitamins, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, minerals, and compounds such as apocynin, scopoletin, and isofraxidin (93307, 93318, 104506, 112819). Flavonoids present include procyanidins, epicatechin, catechin, rutin, quercetin compounds, pinostrobin, and kaempferol compounds. Gallic acid, p-protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid are the most common phenolic acids. The triterpenic acids, ceanothic, alphitolic, zizyberanal, zizyberanalic, piceanothic, ceanothenic, betulinic, oleanolic, ursonic, and zizyberenalic acids, as well as the triterpenes, ziziberanalic and ursolic acids, have all been identified in the fruit (93307, 93318, 112819).\nAnalgesic effects\nZizyphus seed extracts have shown analgesic effects in animal models (87646).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal and in vitro data show that zizyphus extract may have anti-inflammatory effects related to the triterpene acid content. Animal research suggests that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase may play a role (11, 93307). Zizyphus seed essential oil and root bark extract also appear to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (87626, 93312). The root bark extract of zizyphus reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines in an animal model (93312).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that zizyphus has hypoglycemic activity (87589, 87591, 87617, 87637, 87659, 87671). In one study, a leaf extract reduced blood glucose levels for up to 6 hours (87637). In vitro research shows that saponins isolated and extracted from zizyphus prevent sudden increases in postprandial blood glucose by inhibiting carbohydrate digestion enzymes alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, thereby preventing hyperglycemia. Zizyphus saponins also relieve insulin resistance in hepatic cells by inhibiting glucose uptake, increasing activity of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, and regulating the expression of proteins involved in glycolipid metabolism pathways including AMPK, PI3K, and GSK3-beta (112820).\nAntilipidemic effects\nZizyphus fruit contains the polysaccharide pectin, which has been shown to reduce levels of cholesterol (93317).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory data show that zizyphus has antibacterial effects. A methanolic extract containing oleanolic acid and ursolic acid inhibits dental cavity-producing activity of Streptococcus mutans in vitro (11). Proanthocyanidins obtained from zizyphus fruit reduce the antibiotic resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (87592). Seed oil and its extracts show activity against strains of Listeria monocytogenes (87621).\nAntineoplastic effects\nZizyphus extracts have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells in laboratory research, likely by inducing apoptosis. The triterpenic acids appear to play a role in this response (87584, 87613, 93307).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant activity of zizyphus fruit is possibly due to its constituent phenolic compounds and vitamin C. The peel appears to have greater antioxidant capacity than the fruit pulp. Some water-soluble polysaccharide fractions containing uronic acid also appear to have antioxidant effects (93307). The seed and its essential oil, as well as root bark extract, also have antioxidant effects in laboratory research (87621, 87656, 93312). In animal research, both oral and topical use of zizyphus fruit extract reduces oral mucositis associated with 5-flurouracil use, possibly due to antioxidants in the extract (93313).\nAntiviral effects\nAnimal research shows that betulinic acid, isolated from zizyphus roots, has activity against an influenza virus. Inhibition of interferon-gamma may play a role (93310).\nCardiovascular effects\nResearch in a rat model of hypertension shows that aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions of zizyphus fruit extracts, given orally daily for 4 weeks, attenuate the increases in mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate seen after a single dose of a nitric oxide inhibitor, which causes vasoconstriction (104506).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, zizyphus water-soluble carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, pectin, and hemicellulose, appear to maintain intestinal health by protecting the intestinal mucosa, possibly by reducing fecal levels of ammonia and increasing levels of short-chain fatty acids in the colon (87608, 93307). Zizyphus seed and stem bark extracts also appear to protect against gastric ulcers in laboratory research (87644, 93309).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal data show that zizyphus fruit and root bark protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. The mechanism of action appears to involve antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses and may possibly be related to the polysaccharides in the fruit (11, 87619, 87633, 93307, 93312).\nImmune effects\nLaboratory research suggests that some parts of the zizyphus plant might have the potential to alter the immune response. The leaf extract appears to increase activity of neutrophils (87675). Constituents of the seeds, such as protojujubosides, jujubosides, and acetyljujubosides, inhibit histamine release and have other immunological activities (87567, 87665).\nNeurological effects\nNeuroprotective effects of zizyphus have been shown in animal and cell culture models (87585, 87634, 107922). Some protection against ischemic damage or amyloid beta protein appears to be related to antioxidant effects of the fruit (87634, 107922). Zizyphus might also stimulate choline acetyltransferase, possibly resulting in an improvement in memory (87581). Neurological and sedative effects of zizyphus might be related to inhibition of calmodulin, the calcium-binding messenger protein, by constituents (87570, 87582, 87590).\nWeight effects\nAnimal data show that zizyphus increases body weight (11). However, zizyphus extract might also have anti-obesity effects. In vitro, the extract appears to prevent fat accumulation in adipocytes (93307).\nWound healing effects\nIn an animal model of epithelial tissue wounds, topical zizyphus leaf extract ointment accelerates wound healing when compared with untreated controls. Additionally, topical zizyphus leaf extract ointment exerts superior anti-inflammatory effects when compared with control and is slower in its anti-inflammatory actions yet similarly effective to standard treatment, indomethacin (112819)."
