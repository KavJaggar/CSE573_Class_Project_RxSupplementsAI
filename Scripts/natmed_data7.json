            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDysmenorrhea. Taking fennel oil or extract by mouth may reduce pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. This benefit may be similar to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid.\nTwo separate meta-analyses in patients with primary dysmenorrhea show that taking fennel oil or fennel extract for 1-6 menstrual cycles reduces dysmenorrhea pain when compared with placebo. Improvement in pain was similar when compared with ibuprofen or mefenamic acid. In the included studies, doses of fennel oil ranged from 3-30 drops every 4-8 hours, and doses of fennel extract ranged from 30-230 mg daily (104196, 108972). However, most studies included in these meta-analyses were small and low-quality, and all studies were conducted in Iran. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety.

Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for cholera, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nColic. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fennel may reduce crying time in infants with colic. However, most research to date has evaluated fennel in combination with other ingredients.\nA meta-analysis of three small clinical studies shows that giving fennel to infants with colic can reduce crying time by about 72 minutes daily when compared with placebo (97497). However, the studies included in this meta-analysis were at medium to high risk of bias, and the placebo response rate was high in all of the included studies. Additionally, two of the three studies evaluated combination products (16735, 19715, 49428). In the one study that used fennel alone, administering 5-20 mL of fennel seed oil 0.1% emulsion daily for one week led to colic relief in 65% of infants, compared with 24% of infants receiving placebo (49428). The other studies evaluated fennel in combination with lemon balm and German chamomile (ColiMil) or in combination with chamomile, vervain, licorice, and lemon balm (Calma-Bebi, Bonomelli). These combination products produced a response in 57% to 85% of infants, compared with 26% to 49% of infants receiving placebo (16735, 19715).\nless\nConstipation. Oral fennel has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small crossover trial in patients with constipation shows that drinking an herbal tea containing 3 grams of a combination of fennel, anise, elderberry, and senna daily for 5 days can decrease colonic transit time, increase the number of daily evacuations, and improve the perception of bowel function when compared with placebo (49494). Another small clinical study in elderly patients with constipation shows that drinking a specific tea (Smooth Move, Traditional Medicinals) containing fennel, senna, licorice, orange peel, cassia cinnamon, coriander, and ginger for 28 days can increase the number of bowel movements when compared to baseline (46196). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, a small clinical study in patients aged 60-65 years with functional constipation shows that taking a traditional Iranian combination product containing 5 grams each of fennel seed and rose flower, dissolved in water twice daily before meals for 4 weeks, improves constipation severity and stool consistency when compared with polyethylene glycol 10 grams. Improvements in constipation severity persisted in both groups 4 weeks after treatment completion (108973). However, polyethylene glycol is usually taken at a higher dose of 17 grams daily, limiting the validity of these findings.\nless\nCough.

Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral fennel has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with either diarrhea- or constipation-predominant IBS shows that taking two capsules containing fennel essential oil 25 mg and curcumin 42 mg per capsule (CU-FEO, Alfa Wassermann S.p.A.) twice daily for 30 days improves overall ratings of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life by 24% when compared with placebo (97422).\nless\nLactation. Although there has been interest in using oral fennel to stimulate breastmilk production, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nMenopausal symptoms. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fennel oil or fennel seed powder may modestly improve menopausal symptoms.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with medium severity menopausal symptoms shows that taking fennel essential oil 60 mg daily for 8 weeks improves scores on the Menopause Rating Scale when compared with a sunflower oil placebo (97498). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking fennel seed powder 2 grams daily for 8 weeks improves scores on the Kupperman Menopausal Index when compared with placebo (104198).\n\nFennel has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study shows that taking a combination of fennel 120 mg, chamomile 1000 mg, and saffron 60 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces physical, psychological, and urogenital symptom scores on the Menopause Rating Scale when compared with placebo or lower doses of the combination (103628). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in postmenopausal women conducted in Iran shows that taking combined fennel and valerian extract 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves self-reported scores for frequency and severity of hot flashes but does not improve sleep quality or duration of hot flashes when compared with placebo (112369). However, it is unclear if these benefits are due to fennel, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nNausea and vomiting. Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for nausea and vomiting, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nNocturnal enuresis. Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for nocturnal enuresis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral fennel extract is beneficial in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\nA small clinical trial in females with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that taking powdered fennel extract 800 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces pain and disability scores, but not stiffness, when compared with placebo (104199).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral fennel is beneficial in patients with PCOS.\nA small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking two fennel capsules, containing anethole 21-27 mg per capsule, daily along with a hypocaloric standard diet or a hypocaloric high-protein diet for 3 months does not reduce body weight or improve androgenic parameters such as testosterone levels, sex hormone-binding globulin levels, or free androgen index, when compared with these diets plus placebo (104197).\n\nFennel has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in patients with oligomenorrhea due to PCOS shows that taking a traditional combination product (Aslagh) containing equivalent amounts of essential oils of fennel, wild carrot seeds, and Vitex agnus-castus fruit for 3 months, either alone or in combination with metformin, improves rates of menstrual bleeding and menstrual cyclicity similarly to metformin alone. All three groups experienced a significant improvement from baseline. Aslagh was taken as two, 500-mg capsules twice daily, except during menses; metformin was titrated over one week to a dose of 500 mg three times daily (108974). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking fennel 60 mg and Elwendia persica 25 mg twice daily for 4 months modestly improves number of ovarian follicles and body mass index when compared with placebo; however, when compared to baseline, the combination also improves hirsutism scores and menstrual cycle duration and interval (112370). It is unclear if these effects are due to fennel, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nSexual desire. It is unclear if oral fennel is beneficial for improving sexual desire.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking fennel seed powder 2 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve scores on the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire when compared with placebo (104198).\nless\nSunburn. It is unclear if topical fennel emulsion is beneficial for preventing sunburn.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a fennel 5% emulsion topically prior to ultraviolet (UV) exposure can reduce sunburn by 65% when compared with a control (49518).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using oral fennel for upper respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fennel for this purpose.\nVaginal atrophy. It is unclear if intravaginal application of fennel cream is beneficial in patients with vaginal atrophy.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that applying 5 grams of a fennel 5% cream to the vagina once daily for 8 weeks seems to reverse vaginal thinning, improve vaginal pH, and reduce symptoms of vaginal atrophy such as itching, dryness, and pain with intercourse when compared with placebo (92509). Patients in the fennel group also rated their sexual function to be improved when compared with those receiving placebo (97496).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate fennel for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of fennel are the fruit (seed) and oil. Fennel seed is a rich source of beta-carotene and vitamin C (19, 92508). It also contains significant amounts of calcium, magnesium, and iron, and lesser amounts of other metal cations (92508). The seed contains the volatile oil composed largely of trans-anethole, along with fenchone, estragole, and other constituents (6135, 92508). The anethole constituent gives fennel its anise-type aroma and flavor. Fennel fruit contains various flavonoid constituents, including quercetin and kaempferol conjugates (92508).\nAllergy effects\nThe constituent anethole appears to be allergenic (11). However, animal research suggests that fennel fruit extract might reduce allergy symptoms (49438, 92508).\nAnalgesic effects\nFennel extracts have been shown to reduce pain associated with dysmenorrhea (104196). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, analgesic effects have also been shown in animal models, possibly by reducing inflammation (49438, 92508).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of fennel likely explain its use for pain relief during dysmenorrhea. The constituent anethole appears to inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cellular responses (31374). Fennel essential oil also appears to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (34398).\nAntimicrobial effects\nFennel is used traditionally for various infections, mainly of the respiratory tract. Laboratory research suggests that fennel has antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria and fungi (49454, 49464, 92508). Fennel was active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 200 mcg/mL in vitro (49464). The constituent dillapional, found in fennel stems, has antibacterial effects (49413). However, other constituents are likely also effective (39806).\nAntipyretic effects\nIn mice, an ethanolic extract of fennel fruit demonstrated antipyretic activity (92508).\nAntispasmodic effects\nFennel seed is commonly used for gastrointestinal symptoms, such as colic. Fennel seed appears to act as an antispasmodic, possibly by decreasing acetylcholine-induced contraction (19715).\nAntiviral effects\nFennel is used traditionally for various infections, mainly of the respiratory tract. In laboratory research, essential oil of fennel has displayed antiviral activity against Herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) and the RNA virus parainfluenza type-3 (PI-3) (92508).\nCancer effects\nThe constituent estragole is a procarcinogen but the carcinogenic risk is thought to be minimal. It is not directly hepatotoxic or hepatocarcinogenic but requires activation by liver enzymes to reach full toxicity. In the liver, other enzymes inactivate the carcinogenic metabolites, limiting possible damage to the liver (12). Some fennel constituents might also have anti-cancer effects. For example, anethole and polyacetylenes have demonstrated chemopreventive properties in laboratory models (31689, 36202, 40978, 9508). Fennel seeds have been shown to reduce tumor incidence in an animal model, possibly by enhancing the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reducing oxidative stress. The constituent flavonoids might play a role (49479, 92508).\nDigestive effects\nAnimal research suggests that fennel increases gastric acid secretion and activity of digestive enzymes (39864, 49520). It is possible that this aids digestion.\nDiuretic effects\nFennel has traditionally been used as a diuretic (49465). In animal research, fennel extract has been shown to have diuretic effects (49408). However, changes in excretion of electrolytes are not consistent (49408, 92508).\nHormonal effects\nPolymers of the constituent anethole seem to have estrogenic activity (11). These estrogenic effects may result in galactogenesis (92508). Fennel has been shown to have estrogenic activity in animal models including increased uterine weight and growth of breast cancer cells (49440). Fennel also appears to induce estrous and stimulate uterine contractions (92508).\nHypoglycemic effects\nFennel is traditionally used for diabetes. In an animal model of diabetes, fennel essential oil decreased levels of serum glucose and increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (92508).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn an animal model of hyperlipidemia, fennel extract reduced levels of triglycerides and total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were increased (92508).\nInsecticidal effects\nFennel oil has insecticidal effects against various insects at different life stages (15894, 49419, 49442, 49471). Fennel-containing products, including creams and aerosols, exhibited good mosquito repellency in humans (49442). The constituent anethole appears to be insecticidal (11). Other insecticidal and repellent constituents include p-anisaldehyde and fenchone (31363, 92508).\nNeurological effects\nFennel may be useful for cognitive disorders like dementia and Alzheimer disease, as constituents found in fennel essential oils have displayed high inhibitory activity against acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (31438, 49452). In animal research, an extract of the whole fennel plant reduced amnesia, as well as memory deficits associated with aging (49452, 92508).\nOcular effects\nIn animal models of glaucoma, fennel extract reduces ocular pressure similarly to timolol (49477).\nRespiratory effects\nFennel is traditionally used for respiratory disorders and infections. The constituent anethole appears to cause bronchodilation (92508). Anethole and fenchone reduce upper respiratory tract secretions. Some evidence suggests the aqueous fennel extract might also increase mucociliary activity (11). In animals, the volatile oil of fennel stimulated the contraction of the tracheal smooth muscles (92508).\nUterine effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that fennel oil can inhibit contractions of uterine tissue induced by prostaglandin E2. However, it does not inhibit uterine contractions induced by oxytocin (10349).\nVascular effects\nIn animal research, fennel displayed vasorelaxant effects (31415, 49408). This appears to be independent of nitric oxide and possibly involves the constituent anethole (31415).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human research, drinking tea made from 2 grams of dried fennel before meals appears to decrease food consumption and subjective feelings of hunger and increase feelings of fullness (92510). In an animal model, dietary fennel essential oil also reduced food intake (39795)."

    "Fenugreek": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Fenugreek is an aromatic, clover-like herb that is native to the Mediterranean region, southern Europe, and western Asia (90115). The plant has seed-containing pods that form as it matures (90115). The taste and odor of fenugreek seeds resemble maple syrup, leading to its use as a flavoring agent in imitation maple syrup, foods, beverages, and tobacco and to mask the taste of medicines (8111, 90112). The seeds have also been used as a spice and traditional medicine. Fenugreek leaves are eaten in India as a vegetable (719).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Fenugreek has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when the seed is used orally in medicinal amounts. Fenugreek seed powder 5-10 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 years. Fenugreek seed extract 1 gram daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months (7389, 9783, 18359, 18362, 49868, 90112, 90113, 90117, 93419, 93420)(93421, 93422, 93423, 96065, 103285, 108704).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (4912). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of fenugreek when used in larger amounts. Unusual body and urine odor has been reported after consumption of fenugreek tea. Although the odor appears to be harmless, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease (9782, 96068).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts greater than those found in food. Fenugreek has potential oxytoxic and uterine stimulant activity (12531). There are case reports of congenital malformations, including hydrocephalus, anencephaly, cleft palate, and spina bifida, after consumption of fenugreek seeds during pregnancy (96068). Consumption of fenugreek immediately prior to delivery may cause the neonate to have unusual body odor. Although this does not appear to cause long-term sequelae, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease (9781, 96068).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally to stimulate lactation, short-term. Although most available clinical studies lack safety testing in the lactating parent or infant (12535, 22569, 22570), some evidence suggests that taking fenugreek 1725 mg three times daily orally for 21 days does not cause negative side effects in the infant (90115).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, fenugreek seed is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, hypoglycemia, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll ROA: Severe allergic reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock.\nEndocrine\nOrally, large doses of fenugreek seed, 100 grams daily of defatted powder, have caused hypoglycemia (164, 96068).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, fenugreek seed can cause mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal distention and pain, nausea, and flatulence, especially when taken on an empty stomach (622, 12534, 18349, 93421, 96065, 96068, 105016).\nless\nImmunologic\nFenugreek can cause allergic reactions when used orally and topically, and when the powder is inhaled (719, 96068). Orally, fenugreek has caused bronchospasm, diarrhea, and itching, and skin reactions severe enough to require intravenous human immunoglobulin (96068). Topically, fenugreek paste has resulted in facial swelling, wheezing, and numbness around the head (719, 96068). When used both orally and topically by a single individual, asthma and rhinitis occurred (96068). Inhalation of fenugreek powder has resulted in fainting, sneezing, runny nose, and eye tearing (719, 96068).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, loss of consciousness has occurred in a 5 week-old infant drinking tea made from fenugreek (9782). Dizziness and headaches have been reported in clinical research of fenugreek extract (49551, 93419). However, these events are rare.\nless\nRenal\nOrally, fenugreek aqueous see extract may increase the frequency of micturition, although this even appears to be rare (49551).\nless\nOther\nConsumption of fenugreek during pregnancy, immediately prior to delivery, may cause the neonate to have an unusual body odor, which may be confused with maple syrup urine disease. It does not appear to cause long-term sequelae (9781). This unusual body odor may also occur in children drinking fenugreek tea. A case of a specific urine and sweat smell following oral fenugreek extract use has been reported for a patient in one clinical trial (18349).\n\nIn 2011, outbreaks of enteroaggregative hemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EATEC) O104:H4 infection occurred in Germany and Spain. Epidemiological studies linked the outbreaks to fenugreek seeds that had been imported from Africa. However, laboratory analyses were unable to isolate the causative strain of bacteria from fenugreek seed samples (49776, 49777, 49781, 90114).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral fenugreek seed seems to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.\nMeta-analyses of up to14 clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions show that taking fenugreek with or without standard diabetes medications lowers fasting glucose by approximately 14-27 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial glucose by 21-30 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.5-1.2% when compared with placebo (90112, 96065, 105016, 111503, 112120, 113499, 113604, 113630). The most effective doses and formulations seem to include powdered seed or debitterized seed powder 100 grams daily, taken as capsules or added to meals, for up to 3 years or seed hydroalcoholic extract about 1 gram daily for up to 2 months (90112, 96065, 105016, 111503, 112120, 113499). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity and low quality in the included studies.\n\nMost research also shows that fenugreek seed lowers total cholesterol levels and triglycerides in patients with diabetes, but has inconsistent effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (96065, 102252, 113630). Some research shows that taking fenugreek in combination with other ingredients also seems to improve glycemic indices in people with diabetes. These combination products have combined fenugreek with guar gum and gymnema (10284) or millets and legumes (9784).\n\nLimited research has also evaluated fenugreek in type 1 diabetes. In one small clinical study, taking 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% when compared to baseline (622). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral fenugreek seed might help to reduce menstrual pain.\nA meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea shows that taking fenugreek capsules 5.4-6.3 grams daily for 3 days beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive months reduces pain intensity when compared with placebo (113628). However, low-quality clinical studies show that fenugreek seed is not more effective for reducing menstrual pain when compared with garden cress or the anti-inflammatory medication mefenamic acid (113628).\nless\nSexual arousal. Oral fenugreek seed might help to improve sexual arousal.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Testofen, Gencor Pacific Ltd) 600 mg daily for 12 weeks increases sexual function by 15% over baseline, compared with no change in the placebo group; the main benefits were in sexual arousal and drive. Morning erection and sexual frequency also improve by 2- to 3-fold (93419). Another clinical study in healthy males shows that taking the same fenugreek seed extract 600 mg daily in combination with magnesium 34 mg, zinc 30 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg for 6 weeks, improves a composite of symptoms such as sexual cognition, sexual arousal, sexual behavior, and orgasm. The overall improvement in the composite score was 23%, compared with a worsening in the placebo group (93421).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. Oral fenugreek seed extract might help to improve sexual dysfunction.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 300 mg twice daily for two menstrual cycles improves sexual function in healthy pre-menopausal adults with low sex drive. In one clinical trial, overall improvement based on a composite of symptoms was 26% in the fenugreek group, compared with only 2% in the placebo group. Individual scores for sexual cognition, arousal, behavior, drive, and orgasm were all improved. Patients taking fenugreek also had an increased frequency of sexual activity from 1-2 times per month to once per week, compared to no change in the placebo group (93420). Other clinical research in males aged 35-60 years with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily after breakfast for 12 weeks improves sexual arousal, mental alertness, and mood when compared with baseline. This fenugreek seed extract was fortified with 20% protodioscin; the other constituents were not specified (108700). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparator group.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral fenugreek extract does not seem to improve BPH symptoms.\nA clinical study in healthy adults with BPH shows that taking a specific fenugreek extract (Testofen, Bluegum Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve BPH symptoms when compared with placebo (102253).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlopecia areata. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for alopecia areata, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed extract is beneficial for Alzheimer disease.\nA moderate-sized study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 5 mL daily for 4 months modestly improves memory but does not improve depression or quality of life measures when compared with placebo (113498).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nResearch evaluating fenugreek for athletic performance has yielded inconsistent results. The reason for these mixed findings is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adult males shows that taking fenugreek or fenugreek seed extract 250-600 mg daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve upper or lower body strength, lean body mass, or fat mass when compared with placebo (113629). Other small clinical studies in resistance-trained young males show that taking a fenugreek supplement (AI or Torabolic, Indus Biotech; Fenu-FG, Indus Biotech Private Limited) for 8 weeks in addition to training does not improve power or strength when compared with placebo, but modestly improves some measures, such as leg and bench press performance, and slightly reduces body fat (18352, 18353, 93423).\n\nWhile most clinical research is in males, a clinical study in healthy adult females shows that taking fenugreek (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 600 mg daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with resistance training improves lower body strength, lean body mass, and fat mass when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in upper body strength, endurance, or power when compared with placebo (113631).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nCough. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral fenugreek fiber is beneficial for improving heartburn symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with frequent heartburn shows that taking a specific fenugreek fiber product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium), 2 grams twice daily 30 minutes before the two biggest meals of the day, improves heartburn after one week of treatment and continuing through the 2-week study period. Fenugreek seemed to be similarly effective to ranitidine 75 mg twice daily (17372).\nless\nGout. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek supplements might be beneficial for improving lipid levels.\nOverall, fenugreek powdered seed seems to modestly reduce lipid levels in people with or without hyperlipidemia; however, most studies have been low-quality, small, and exploratory. Meta-analyses of these studies show that fenugreek reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (103283, 103284). Powdered fenugreek seed has been studied in doses of 0.5-100 grams daily for 10 days to 3 years. While some studies show modest improvement, others show no benefit (622, 7389, 9783, 18359, 18361, 18362, 102252, 103283, 103284, 113497).\nless\nHypertension. Analysis of small clinical studies suggests that oral fenugreek might slightly improve systolic blood pressure (SBP).\nA meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome shows that taking fenugreek seed 0.5-50 grams daily for 6-144 weeks reduces SBP by 3.5 mmHg but does not improve diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analysis suggests that taking fenugreek at a dose of 15 grams or more daily or for a duration of 12 weeks or less modestly reduces DBP (112110).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral fenugreek is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Trigogen, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, or postprandial insulin when compared with placebo (113497). Another small clinical trial in patients with prediabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 200 mg, bergamot extract 500 mg, and olive leaf extract 100 mg daily for 6 months does not improve glycated hemoglobin or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (102251).\nless\nJoint pain. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for joint pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nLactation. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek, either as a supplement or tea, might increase lactation.\nA network meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking fenugreek shortly after delivery may modestly increase breast milk production when compared with placebo. Patients in the included studies took fenugreek 1-2 grams as capsules or tea up to 3 times daily for 21-244 days. In most cases, fenugreek treatment was initiated one or two days after delivery. However, fenugreek might be less beneficial for breast milk production when compared with the natural ingredients Indian borage or palm date (96067).\n\nFenugreek has also been used in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study suggests that drinking a specific herbal tea containing fenugreek. hibiscus, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and fennel oil (Humana Still-Tee, Humana, Germany) 200 mL three times daily modestly increases milk production when compared with placebo (22569). Another study in exclusively breastfeeding parents of 2-month-old infants shows that eating lactation cookies containing fenugreek, oatmeal, brewer's yeast, and flaxseed meal daily for 30 days do not improve milk production, perceived insufficiency, or breastfeeding self-efficacy when compared with control (112116).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving sperm quality in males with infertility.\nA small clinical study in healthy male patients ages 20-30 years with oligospermia shows that taking fenugreek seed oil 12 macro drops orally three times daily for 4 months improves sperm count from 6.2 million to 20.1 million, increases sperm motility from 43% to 61%, and reduces sperm abnormality from 68% to 53% when compared with baseline. However, taking the remaining fenugreek seed components 10 grams three times daily for 4 months does not seem to have this effect (90119). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in perimenopausal patients shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (FenuSMART) 250 mg, standardized to protodioscin 10.3%, trigonelline 3.1%, and total saponin 42.6%, twice daily with meals for 42 days does not improve menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo. However, there was a non-significant trend to reduced hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and insomnia in the treatment group (105000). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of 29 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions shows that taking fenugreek at doses ranging from 25 mg to 60 grams daily for up to 144 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 17 mg/dL, triglycerides by 20 mg/dL, waist circumference by 2.5 cm, and systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 3.5 mg/dL when compared with control. However, no effect was found on diastolic blood pressure or body mass index (113500).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for increasing muscle strength.\nA small study in healthy, active males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 400 mg or 500 mg daily for 60 days increases grip strength when compared with placebo (103285).\nless\nMyalgia. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for myalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nObesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek seed or fiber may increase satiety and decrease caloric intake.\nTwo small clinical studies in overweight and normal weight males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract modestly reduces daily fat intake. At a dose of 392 mg three times daily for 2-6 weeks, fat intake is reduced by 13% to 17%. However, a lower dose of 196 mg three times daily appears to be ineffective. Neither of the doses affect weight, appetite, or satiety (18348, 18349). Another small clinical study in obese adults shows that adding 8 grams of fenugreek fiber powder (FenuLife, Frutarom Inc) to a low-calorie beverage increases feelings of satiety and decreases hunger and lunchtime food intake. A lower dose of 4 grams appears to be less effective for reducing hunger but was considered to be more palatable (18350).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for Parkinson disease symptoms.\nOne small clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease who are also using levodopa shows that taking fenugreek seed extract (Indus Biotech Private Limited, Pune) 300 mg twice daily for 6 months does not seem to improve behavioral or motor symptoms when compared with placebo (90113).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for PCOS.\nA small clinical study in adults with symptomatic PCOS shows that adding a specific fenugreek seed extract (Goldarou Pharmaceutical Co.) 500 mg twice daily to metformin for 8 weeks does not improve insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, or other symptoms when compared with placebo and metformin (90117). However, other small clinical studies in adults with PCOS show that taking another specific fenugreek seed extract (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.) 1000 mg, enriched with 40% furostanolic saponins, daily for 90 days is associated with a reduction in ovarian cyst size in 46% of patients, complete dissolution in 36% of patients, normalization of menstrual cycles in 71% to 80% of patients, and subsequent pregnancy in 12% of patients. Further, this extract appears to reduce mean cyst size by 42% to 45%, the number of cysts by 38%, ovary volume by 24% to 40%, and hirsutism by 27% while reducing luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free testosterone, and prolactin and improving liver function and the severity of PCOS-associated ailments including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (93422, 112112, 113502). The validity of some of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, this study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nVaginitis. There is limited evidence on the topical use of fenugreek cream in patients with atrophic vaginitis.\nOne small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with atrophic vaginitis shows that administration of 0.5 grams of fenugreek 5% cream intravaginally twice weekly for 12 weeks reduces symptoms of atrophic vaginitis and reduces vaginal pH when compared to baseline. However, fenugreek was not as effective as vaginal cream containing conjugated estrogens (103286). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with vaginal atrophy shows that applying a fenugreek cream 5% intravaginally daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce dyspareunia and vaginal dryness and increase vaginal maturation when compared with a placebo cream (105023).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate fenugreek for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nFenugreek seed powder has most often been used in doses of 5-10 grams daily for up to 3 years; daily doses as high as 100 grams have been used for up to 20 days. Fenugreek seed extract is most often used in doses of about 0.6-1.2 grams daily for up to 3 months (90112, 93420, 93422, 96065). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nOne capsule of a specific fenugreek product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium) has been standardized to contain 500 mg of fractioned tempered fenugreek seeds (85% total fiber) and galactomannan with a 1:1 mannose to galactose ratio (17372). One capsule of a different fenugreek product (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) contains 300 mg of an extract equivalent to 9.9 grams of dry fenugreek product and is standardized to 50% saponin glycosides (93420). Another fenugreek product is an extract standardized to 40% furostanolic saponins (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.). Each capsule contains 500 mg fenugreek extract. Batch #FCYS0813 was used in the study (93422). Fenu-FG capsules contain 300 mg of fenugreek furostanol glycosides (Indus Biotech Private Ltd., Pune, India), characterized by HPLC fingerprinting (93423). Another fenugreek extract (Testofen, Gencor Pacific Ltd) has been used in clinical trials (93419, 93421).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, fenugreek might have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\nSome of the constituents in fenugreek have antiplatelet effects in animal and in vitro research. However, common fenugreek products might not contain sufficient concentrations of these constituents for clinical effects. A clinical study in patients with coronary artery disease or diabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed powder 2.5 grams twice daily for 3 months does not affect platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic activity, or fibrinogen levels (5191, 7389, 49643).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, fenugreek seed might have additive hypoglycemic effects when used with antidiabetes drugs.\nClinical research shows that fenugreek seed can reduce fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (10284, 90112, 96065, 105016).\nless\nCLOPIDOGREL (Plavix)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, fenugreek seed might alter the clinical effects of clopidogrel by inhibiting its conversion to the active form.\nAnimal research shows that fenugreek seed 200 mg/kg daily for 14 days increases the maximum serum concentration of clopidogrel by 21%.

After intravenous injection, the t1/2 (Ka) was 10.8 minutes and the t1/2 (Ke) was 44 minutes (49585).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of fenugreek is the seed. The dried or fresh leaves are also used as an herb or vegetable (96068). Fenugreek constituents include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins (96068). Fenugreek seeds have a distinctive bitter taste and odor due to the alkaloids of volatiles found in the seed (96068).\n\nThe active constituents include trigonelline, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and sotolon (12533, 49582). Sotolon is frequently used as a flavoring for artificial maple syrup (12533). Soaking fenugreek seeds overnight and washing the seeds in water can decrease some of the taste and odor (9783). Other constituents of fenugreek include steroidal saponins, including diosgenin (49571, 49683), yamogenin (96068), protodioscin (49573), and trigoneosides (49543).\n\nFenugreek seeds are high in dietary fiber, including galactomannan (49655, 49774). They contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin. Fenugreek seed is also a good source of protein (49827). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine (12533, 49641).\n\nFenugreek seed oil contains the following fatty acids: linoleic, oleic, linolenic, arachidic, palmitolic, eicosadienoic, palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids, with combined linoleic and oleic acids making up 67% to 76% of fatty acids (90119).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFenugreek is used in traditional topical anti-inflammatory treatments. In various animal models, fenugreek seed extract had anti-inflammatory effects. However, a mechanism of action is not clear (49550, 49720).\nAnticancer effects\nFenugreek is traditionally used orally for cancer prevention. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in fresh vegetables, including fenugreek leaves, protected against gallbladder cancer (49651). In animal research, fenugreek seeds inhibited colon carcinogenesis (49601, 49686) and breast cancer (49631). This may be due to the apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects of fenugreek and its constituents on cancer cells, as shown in vitro (49573, 49692, 49724). Although the mechanisms of action are not clear, various laboratory studies have shown that fenugreek constituents interfere with cell signaling pathways in cancer cells (49731, 49751), as well as increase antioxidant status (49686).\nAntidiabetic effects\nMany clinical studies show that taking fenugreek seed improves postprandial and fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test results, and 24-hour urinary glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (90112, 96065). In patients with type 1 diabetes, 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder taken twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% (622). Fenugreek seeds contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin and may affect gastrointestinal transit, slowing glucose absorption (49723, 49791). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine, which appears to directly stimulate insulin (8112, 12532, 12533). This effect is glucose-dependent and only occurs in the presence of moderate to high glucose concentrations. In other laboratory research, fenugreek seed extract appears to stimulate the effects of insulin in adipocyte, muscle, and liver cells (49635, 49659). Other fenugreek constituents with potential hypoglycemic effects include trigonelline, as shown in animal research (49763).\nAntioxidant activity\nThe antioxidant effects of fenugreek and its constituents may explain some of its clinical effects. Antioxidant effects of fenugreek have been shown in various animal models, resulting in improvements in both antioxidant and oxidant levels (49526, 49565, 49586, 49640, 49686, 49754, 49866).\nAntiplatelet activity\nFenugreek contains coumarins and other constituents that might affect platelet aggregation, but these constituents may not be present in quantities that would produce clinically significant effects (7389). In animal research, a fenugreek leaf extract inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (49643).\nAntiulcer effects\nFenugreek is traditionally used for dyspepsia, GERD, and mouth ulcers. Animal research shows that fenugreek protects against aspirin- and ethanol-induced gastric injury, possibly by increasing the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and by decreasing thiol groups (49867, 113501). It was also suggested that fenugreek gel has effects on mucosal glycoproteins and prevents a rise in lipid peroxidation induced by aspirin (49867). However, in laboratory research, fenugreek extract did not have bactericidal effects against Helicobacter pylori (36131).\nErgogenic effects\nIn young males, a specific fenugreek extract (Torabolic, Indus Biotech) increased leg and bench press performance (18353). Clinical research in untrained adults performing an incremental cycle to exhaustion test shows that taking either a specific fenugreek soluble fiber (FenuMAT; Akay Group, Ltd) 300 mg or a specific combination product containing turmeric and fenugreek (CurQfen; Akay Group Ltd) 500 mg daily for 28 days increases ventilatory threshold, but has no effect on peak oxygen consumption or respiratory exchange ratio, when compared with placebo (108702). Other human studies have examined the possible mechanism of action on exercise performance. Although the constituent amino acid, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, increased muscle glycogen concentration (49624), fenugreek extract was found to have no effect on muscle glycogen synthesis (49689). In animal research, fenugreek increased swimming endurance, perhaps by increasing the utilization of fatty acids as an energy source (49664).\nHormonal effects\nIn males with oligospermia, fenugreek seed oil, but not remaining fenugreek seed components, improves sperm count and quality (90119). These improvements have also been observed in males with primary hypogonadism using a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) (108700). In males, fenugreek has been shown to increase testosterone levels. This is mainly due to an increase in free testosterone and not total testosterone (18352, 93419, 93423, 103282). Other clinical research in males with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract fortified with protodioscin 20% (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks increases free and total testosterone levels by 0.9 ng/dL and 110 ng/dL, respectively, and modestly decreases dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) levels when compared with baseline (108700). This increase in testosterone levels is also seen in animal models of diabetes or testicular damage (93424, 93426) but not in castrated animals where only total testosterone was measured (93425). However, in one study of healthy young males, fenugreek extract did not increase testosterone levels (93421). It is possible that fenugreek extract only improves testosterone levels in individuals with lower baseline levels.\n\nFenugreek also appears to increase testosterone levels in females (93420). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, it has been suggested that fenugreek saponins might increase testosterone levels by partially inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and aromatase enzymes (93419) or upregulating enzymes involved in steroid synthesis in the testis (93426). The fenugreek saponins might also bind to estrogen receptors and induce estrogen-responsive genes (93420, 93421). In females, fenugreek extract increases estradiol levels (93421), as well as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (93422). Fenugreek extract does not appear to alter levels of DHEA-S, androstenedione, estradiol, sex hormone-blinding globulin, or prolactin (93419).\n\nAnimal models suggest the potential for anti-fertility, abortifacient, and teratogenic effects at oral doses of at least 100 mg/kg. In male animals, complete infertility, hormonal changes, and sperm toxicity, including decreased sperm count and motility and morphological abnormalities, have been seen. In female animals, high levels of fenugreek have resulted in changes in hormone levels, decreased implantation rates, and increased abortifacient effects. Fetal size was reduced and fetal mortality increased (96068). Teratogenic effects include neurological abnormalities (96068). The human equivalent of the lowest dose causing negative effects during pregnancy is 972 mg per 60 kg (96068).\nHypolipidemic effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking fenugreek seed reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but has inconsistent effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (622, 7389, 9783, 18359, 18361, 18362). In vitro, the hypolipidemic effect of fenugreek seeds was thought to be mediated through inhibition of fat accumulation and upregulation of the LDL receptor (49746). The hypolipidemic effects of fenugreek may also be due to their constituent saponins. Saponins are altered to sapogenins in the gastrointestinal tract. Sapogenins increase biliary cholesterol secretion, potentially leading to lower serum cholesterol levels (49766, 49839).\nRenoprotective effects\nSome evidence from animal research suggests that fenugreek seed consumption might decrease calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys (720, 49687).\nStimulating effects\nPreliminary research suggests fenugreek has stimulating effects on the uterus, intestine, and heart (12531).\nTeratogenic effects\nAnimal research shows that fenugreek has antifertility and teratogenic effects (96068). These effects might be related to the hormonal activities of the saponins in fenugreek. Also, the flavonoids in fenugreek could cross the placenta and cause pro-oxidant effects, damaging the DNA (96068). Neurotoxic effects of fenugreek have been shown in animal models suggesting that prenatal exposure to fenugreek could impact the neurological development and later performance (96068). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, the monoaminergic and cholinergic systems might be involved (96068). Fenugreek also seems to inhibit hematopoietic regulatory elements in bone marrow, altering the hematological count of the fetus (96068).\nWeight loss effects\nIn short-term human research, a fenugreek seed extract has been shown to reduce daily fat intake but it does not appear to affect weight, appetite, or satiety (18348, 18349). Fenugreek fiber intake at breakfast increases feelings of satiety (18350). Although effects on weight loss in humans is not clear, in animal models, fenugreek fiber and seed extract have been shown to reduce body weight and food intake (49634, 49681)."

The fermentation process denatures or partially predigests proteins found in milk, which makes it more digestible. Also, some of the lactose is broken down to glucose and galactose through the action of lactase, which makes fermented milk appealing to people who are lactose-intolerant. Milk fermentation also increases the shelf-life of the product (29967).",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Small clinical studies suggest that drinking fermented milk might prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.\nOne small clinical study shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing a minimum of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG 100 million colony forming units (CFU)/mL, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 10 million CFU/mL, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 100 million CFU/mL by mouth daily for 14 days lowers the relative risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 79% when compared with the same milk product containing heat-killed bacteria (25489). Another small clinical study in hospitalized patients receiving systemic antibiotics shows that drinking 49 grams of fermented milk containing at least 50 billion CFU of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lacticaseibacillus casei (Bio-K+ CL1285, Bio-K+ International Inc) by mouth daily for 2 days followed by 98 grams daily until the end of antibiotic treatment reduces the relative risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 55% when compared with placebo (25494).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Drinking fermented milk toward the end of pregnancy and in the first few months postpartum might prevent atopic dermatitis in children.\nA large clinical study shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis during pregnancy from 36 weeks gestation until 3 months postpartum reduces the odds of the child developing atopic dermatitis by 6 years of age by approximately 52% when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nCommon cold. Drinking fermented milk might prevent the common cold in children and adults.\nA clinical study in children aged 3-6 years attending daycare shows that drinking a fermented milk product containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (Actimel, Danone) 200 grams daily for 3 months reduces the risk of developing the common cold, the most common upper respiratory tract infection in these children, by around 18% when compared with a control milk product. The fermented milk product did not affect medication use or sick leave from daycare (96882). Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy, male, middle-aged office workers shows that drinking a fermented milk made with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota for 12 weeks reduces the incidence and duration of the common cold by 59% when compared with a control milk (98426).\nless\nDiarrhea. Clinical research suggests that drinking fermented milk might reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children. There are mixed findings related to the use of fermented milk to prevent acute diarrhea in this population.\nOne clinical study in infants and children attending daycare shows that drinking 125 or 250 grams of milk fermented by yogurt cultures and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DN-114 001 daily for one month reduces the duration of diarrhea, but not the incidence of acute diarrhea, when compared with jellied milk (14373). Another large clinical study in children aged 6 to 24 months shows that drinking 100 grams of milk fermented with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei reduces the relative risk of diarrhea by about 28% when compared with yogurt (14374). A smaller clinical study in children aged 6 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea shows that drinking a specific fermented milk product (Actimel) containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus reduces the time needed to control diarrhea by about half a day when compared with ultra-heat treated yogurt (27307).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Small clinical studies suggest that drinking fermented milk might improve H. pylori-related symptoms in adults and improve H. pylori eradication rates in children.\nA small clinical study in H. pylori-positive adults shows that drinking 100 mL of a fermented milk beverage containing Bifidobacterium bifidum BF-1 and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 12 weeks improves upper gastrointestinal symptoms and total symptoms number, but not serum pepsinogen concentration, which is a marker of H. pylori infection, when compared with placebo (27308). Another small clinical study in adults with H. pylori infection shows that drinking fermented milk containing Staphylococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus johnsonii daily for 16 weeks reduces the severity of antral gastritis, decreases the density of H. pylori in the antrum, and increases mucus thickness when compared to treatment with milk fermented with only Staphylococcus thermophilus (27309).\n\nThe effect of fermented milk on H. pylori infection has also been investigated in children. A small clinical trial shows that adding a specific fermented milk product (Actimel) containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DN-114 001 to standard therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) for 14 days increases the rate of eradication by 47% when compared with standard therapy alone. The eradication rates in children receiving fermented milk with standard therapy or standard therapy alone were around 85% and 58%, respectively (27310). Other clinical research in H. pylori-colonized children aged 6 to 17 years shows that taking 160 mL of a commercial fermented dairy product containing live L. johnsonii La1 (Chamyto, Nestle´-Chile SA) 5 days each week for 4 weeks modestly reduces H. pylori colonization when compared to baseline. However, changes in H. pylori colonization did not differ between children taking the fermented beverage containing live or heat-treated L. johnsonii or vehicle. The beverages were fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus (110934).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Analysis of clinical research suggests that taking fermented milk products might slightly reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia, with overweight or obese individuals benefitting the most.\nA meta-analysis of 39 small clinical trials in adults with or without hypercholesterolemia shows that taking fermented milk products daily for 2-24 weeks decreases total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 8.3 mg/dL and 7.3 mg/dL, respectively, when compared with placebo, with more pronounced effects in overweight or obese individuals and those taking fermented milk products containing Bifidobacterium strains. These products did not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels when compared with placebo overall, although triglyceride levels improved in obese individuals and in studies lasting 8 weeks or longer (106429).\nless\nHypertension. Small clinical studies suggest that drinking fermented milk or taking fermented milk tablets might lower systolic but not diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension.\nOne small clinical study in patients with mild hypertension shows that drinking 150 mL of fermented milk, prepared with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571, daily for 5 weeks modestly lowers systolic blood pressure but not diastolic blood pressure when compared with drinking artificially acidified milk (102279). Another small clinical study in females with mild hypertension shows that drinking 100 mL of fermented milk, prepared with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota and Lactococcus lactis YIT 2027 to naturally contain 10-12 mg of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), daily for 12 weeks decreases systolic but not diastolic blood pressure when compared with acidified milk placebo (19367). Fermented milk has also been administered in a tablet form. A small clinical study in mildly hypertensive patients shows that taking six tablets (12 grams) containing powdered fermented milk prepared with Lactobacillus helveticus CM4 daily for 4 weeks decreases systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by 11 mmHg when compared with placebo tablets (27318).\n\nObservational research has found that drinking fermented milk is associated with lower incidence of hypertension onset. In normotensive adults who consumed fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota at least 3 times weekly, hypertension developed in approximately 6% of individuals over a 5-year period compared with 14% of those consuming fermented milk less than 3 times weekly (96881).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Drinking fermented milk might improve bloating, flatulence, and pain in patients with IBS.\nA small clinical study in patients with IBS shows that drinking 200 grams of a specific probiotic fermented milk (AB100 Jianneng; Bright Dairy) containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum twice daily for 4 weeks decreases symptoms of IBS, such as stomach pain and gas, when compared to baseline (27321). Another small clinical trial in patients with IBS shows that taking 2.7 grams of reconstituted fermented milk powder containing Lactobacillus gasseri CP2305 daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces IBS symptom severity and improves fecal characteristics and the number of bowel movements when compared with a skimmed milk powder (112594). A larger clinical study in patients with IBS shows that drinking 125 grams of a specific fermented milk product (Activia, Danone) containing Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 and yogurt strains twice daily for 6 weeks improves quality of life and decreases bloating when compared with consuming heat-treated yogurt (27322).\nless\nLactose intolerance. Small clinical studies suggest that drinking fermented milk reduces gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with lactose intolerance.\nA small clinical study shows that individuals with lactose intolerance experience fewer gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, diarrhea, pain) and have lower scores on the hydrogen breath test after consuming 480 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus when compared with consuming 480 mL of regular milk (27311). Another small clinical study in lactase-deficient individuals shows that consuming specific fermented milk products (Ofilus; Bulgofilus) along with meals that contain lactose 18 grams results in fewer gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence, and loose stools, when compared with lactulose 10 grams (27312).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. Small clinical studies suggest that drinking fermented milk for 5 days reduces the duration of rotaviral diarrhea by around 1-1.4 days in children.\nA small clinical study in children with acute rotaviral diarrhea shows that drinking 125 grams of a fermented milk product containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG twice daily for 5 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by around one day when compared with a fermented-then-pasteurized yogurt (1253). Another small clinical study in this population shows that drinking 125 grams of a fermented milk product containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG twice daily for about 5 days shortens the duration of diarrhea by about 1.4 days and increases IgA antibodies to rotavirus when compared with taking fermented-then-pasteurized yogurt (27306).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAsthma. Drinking fermented milk does not seem to reduce the number of asthma episodes in children. Also, drinking fermented milk during pregnancy does not appear to prevent the development of asthma in children.\nClinical research in preschool children with asthma shows that taking 100 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus by mouth once daily for 12 months does not decrease the number of asthma episodes when compared with placebo (25485). Other clinical research in children aged 2-5 years with asthma shows that taking fermented milk (Danone) 100 mL containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 daily for 12 months does not increase the time free from asthma episodes, the mean duration of episodes, or the cumulative number of episodes, when compared with a control milk. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112512).\n\nClinical research also shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis during pregnancy from 36 weeks gestation until 3 months postpartum does not reduce the odds of the child developing asthma by 6 years of age when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Drinking fermented milk does not seem to prevent URTIs in children or nursing home residents.\nOne clinical trial in children aged 3-6 years attending a daycare center shows that drinking a fermented milk product containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (Actimel, Danone) 200 grams daily for 3 months does not reduce the duration or severity of URTIs or the overall risk of developing a URTI over a 4-month period. However, it does appear to reduce the risk of developing the common cold, the most common URTI in these children, by around 18% when compared with a control milk product (96882). A clinical trial in elderly nursing home residents shows that drinking 2 bottles of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of developing respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo milk (96885).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent allergic rhinitis in children or improve nasal or ocular symptoms in children and adults; research is mixed and of low quality.\nClinical research on the use of fermented milk to improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis in adults is mixed. One small clinical study in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis shows that drinking 100 mL of heat-treated fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 30 billion colony forming units (CFU) daily for 8 weeks decreases subjective nasal symptoms, but not ocular symptoms, when compared with an acidified placebo milk (25488). Clinical research in adults with mild to moderate perennial allergy shows that taking 100 grams of a milk fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 16 weeks modestly improves the severity of nasal congestion and the proportion of patients with an improvement or disappearance of overall symptoms when compared with taking milk fermented only with S. thermophilus. However, there was no significant difference between groups on subjective feelings of sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy eyes, or tearing severity, or on symptoms as evaluated by the physician (110926). A small clinical study in adults with allergic rhinitis caused by Japanese cedar pollen shows that drinking 80 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota 40 billion CFU daily for 8 weeks does not improve allergic nasal symptoms when compared with drinking non-fermented milk (25486).\n\nFermented milk has also been evaluated for the prevention or treatment of allergic rhinitis in children. One clinical study in preschool children with allergic rhinitis shows that taking 100 mL of fermented milk containing L. paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus by mouth once daily for 12 months decreases the annual number of rhinitis episodes by 1.6 when compared with placebo (25485). In children aged 2-5 years with allergic rhinitis, clinical research shows that taking fermented milk (Danone) 100 mL containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 daily for 12 months does not improve the duration or total number of rhinitis episodes when compared with a control milk. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus (112512). While other clinical research shows that drinking 200-400 mL of fermented milk containing S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus for 30 days does not improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents with perennial allergic rhinitis, fortifying the product with L. paracasei improves quality of life when compared with drinking fermented milk that does not contain L. paracasei (25487).\n\nFermented milk has also been studied for the prevention of allergic rhinitis in newborns. Clinical research shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis during pregnancy from 36 weeks gestation until 3 months postpartum does not reduce the odds of the child developing allergic rhinitis by 6 years of age when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nBiliary disorders. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for biliary disorders, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent bladder cancer.\nObservational research has found that higher consumption of fermented milk products is associated with a 22% lower risk of bladder cancer when compared with lower consumption (102280).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent breast cancer.\nObservational research has found that drinking 1.5 glasses (over 225 grams) of fermented milk daily for one year is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer when compared with not consuming fermented milk (27304).\nless\nCancer. Observational research suggests that drinking fermented milk might slightly reduce the risk of cancer-related mortality in females but not males.\nA meta-analysis of 10 observational studies has found that higher intake of fermented milk in females, but not males, is associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of cancer-related mortality when compared with low fermented milk intake. No relationship between fermented milk intake and the risk of mortality due to specific cancer types was found (110462).\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk improves growth in children.\nClinical research in preschool children shows that drinking an iron-fortified fermented milk beverage for 101 days improves nutritional status and iron markers when compared with regular milk. However, it does not affect weight or height (27323).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent colorectal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of 31 observational studies has found that the highest intake of dairy products (milk, cheese, and fermented milk) is associated with a 21% and 29% lower risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer, respectively, when compared with the lowest intake. However, the risk for colorectal cancer and death are not reduced if only fermented milk intake is considered, except in studies with a follow-up period of 10 years or longer (106428).\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial in patients with constipation; clinical research is mixed.\nOne clinical trial in females with constipation shows that drinking 100 grams of a specific fermented milk (BIO, Danone) containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus daily for 2 weeks increases stool frequency when compared with an acidified milk control product (27315). Preliminary clinical research in adults with mild constipation shows that taking fermented milk 120 gram containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 weeks increases the number of defecations per week by 2.1. However, it is unclear if changes were statistically significant when compared with fermented milk without L. johnsonii (110933). However, a small clinical study in females with constipation shows that drinking a probiotic fermented milk beverage containing Bifidobacterium animalis daily with breakfast for 60 days is no more effective for improving symptoms than a non-fermented milk (96880). Similarly, in patients with constipation associated with depression, another small clinical study shows that consuming 100 mL of a fermented dairy beverage containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota 100 million CFU/mL daily for 9 weeks does not reduce total scores on a constipation scale when compared with a dairy beverage without bacteria, although there might be improvement in some subscale scores (106427).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent CHD.\nObservational research in healthy males ages 42-60 years has found that higher consumption of fermented milk products is associated with a lower risk of developing CHD when compared with lower consumption. An increase of fermented dairy products daily intake by 100 grams was associated with a 7% lower risk of CHD (102282).\nless\nDental caries. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for prevention of dental caries, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nOne small clinical study in middle-aged and older males with diabetes shows that drinking a specific fermented milk product (Cardi-04, Chr. Hansen A/S) containing Lactobacillus helveticus 300 mL daily for 12 weeks does not decrease blood pressure, lipids, or inflammatory markers or improve glucose regulation when compared with a placebo milk product. However, the fermented milk product did attenuate an increase in fasting plasma glucose (96879). Another small clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking fermented goat milk 120 grams containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 daily for 6 weeks modestly reduces levels of glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not fasting blood glucose or insulin resistance, when compared with conventional fermented milk containing Streptococcus thermophilus TA-40 (110973).\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nFlatulence. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for flatulence, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for GERD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial in patients with IBD.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis, ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and/or ileorectal anastomosis shows that taking 500 mL of a specific fermented milk product (Cultura Dairies BA) containing lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria by mouth daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms, such as involuntary defecation, leakage, and abdominal cramps, when compared to baseline (27325, 27326). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nA small clinical trial in Japanese medical students shows that taking fermented milk 100 mL containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota daily for 11 weeks, starting 8 weeks prior to a stressful standardized examination, modestly reduces feelings of sleepiness upon rising and increases sleep length when compared with a non-fermented placebo milk. Objective measures of sleep latency were also reduced. There was no effect on total sleep time or sleep efficacy (111949). Another small clinical trial in Japanese medical students with acute stress shows that taking fermented milk 190 grams containing heat-killed Lactobacillus gasseri CP2305 daily for 5 weeks modestly improves sleep quality when compared with a placebo milk. In males, but not females, there was also a modest improvement in stress-associated diarrhea, sleep latency, and sleep duration (112581). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect some differences between groups.\nless\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nOsteoporosis. Although there has been interest in using oral fermented milk for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fermented milk for this purpose.\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can reduce the risk of mortality.\nObservational research has found that higher intake of fermented milk products is associated with slightly lower total mortality rates when compared with lower fermented milk intake (110461).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial for Parkinson disease.\nClinical research in patients with Parkinson disease shows that drinking fermented milk 100 mL providing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota daily for 12 weeks reduces the use of laxatives by around 15% per week and modestly improves stool consistency and symptoms of constipation when compared with an acidified milk placebo. There were also modest improvements in non-motor symptoms, anxiety, and depression, but not in overall disease severity or dopaminergic therapy requirements (111956).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can prevent the development of peptic ulcers.\nObservational research has found that higher intake of fermented milk products is associated with a lower incidence of peptic ulcer in adults, even after controlling for possible causative variables of smoking, ethnicity, and divorce (27324).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can reduce diarrhea and bowel discomfort in patients with radiation-induced diarrhea.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer shows that drinking 150 mL of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus daily for 5 days before radiotherapy and continuing for 10 days thereafter reduces diarrhea and increases flatulence when compared with only receiving dietary counseling (27327). Another small clinical study in patients with chronic bowel complications caused by previous radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies shows that drinking a fermented milk beverage containing Lactococcus lactis and Lactococcus cremoris or Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus diacetylactis, Leuconostoc, and Lactococcus cremoris improves bowel discomfort when compared to baseline (27328). However, a small clinical trial in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy shows that drinking 96 mL of fermented milk (Danone) containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DN-114 001 three times daily, starting a week before the initiation of radiation treatment, does not delay the development of diarrhea when compared with a placebo milk. The fermented milk was continued throughout treatment and made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112513).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk can reduce the risk of stroke.\nObservational research has found that higher intake of fermented milk products is not associated with a lower risk of stroke when compared with lower fermented milk intake (110460).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if drinking fermented milk is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis; findings from low-quality clinical studies are mixed.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis show that drinking 100 mL of fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus daily for up to one year decreases disease activity and reduces symptom exacerbations when compared with placebo (12775, 14338). However, another small clinical study in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis shows that drinking 100 mL of fermented milk with Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (10 billion bacteria) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (1 billion bacteria) daily for 48 weeks does not increase the rate of relapse-free survival or reduce the risk of relapse when compared with placebo (98740).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate fermented milk for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with fermented milk.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn healthy adults, approximately 90% of ingested proteins from fermented milk were absorbed along the small intestine over a period of 240 minutes. Also, 67% of calcium was absorbed from fermented milk in the duodenum (27397).\nExcretion\nThere is some evidence in healthy individuals that probiotic bacteria found in fermented milk pass into the feces without having adhered or multiplied in the gastrointestinal tract (27338).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFermented milk contains sugars normally found in milk, such as oligosaccharides, lactose, glucose, and galactose, as well as vitamins such as folate and riboflavin, minerals including calcium and phosphorus, proteins and bioactive peptides, organic acids, and medium-chain fatty acids (27333, 27354, 57384).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research suggests that the anti-inflammatory effects of fermented milk are limited. A meta-analysis of 14 small clinical studies shows that taking fermented milk products can cause a slight reduction in C-reactive protein levels and a slight increase in interferon-gamma levels when compared with a control. However, fermented milk products do not seem to alter levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, or IL-10 (110463).\nAntiallergy effects\nAnimal and human studies suggest that lactic acid bacteria, commonly found in fermented milk products, alleviate allergic diseases (25485, 25486, 25487, 25488). The mechanism may involve enhancement of Th1 immune responses in patients with high concentrations of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) (27355).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that fermented milk products contain antimicrobial compounds that inhibit the growth of salmonella and shigella, which are enhanced by the addition of human gastric juice (27356, 27357). Lactic acid bacteria found in fermented milk products may release compounds that prevent pathogenic bacteria from colonizing in the digestive tract (27360). According to human research, regular intake of fermented milk may reduce potentially pathogenic bacteria in the upper respiratory tract, but not bacterial vaginosis (27358, 27359).\nAntihypertensive effects\nFermented milk has been shown to lower blood pressure in mildly hypertensive people (19367, 27318, 27319). There is conflicting evidence regarding its effects in normotensive individuals (27334, 27348, 85634). Animal and human models have demonstrated that peptides derived from milk proteins may have ACE-inhibiting properties (27361, 27362, 27363). It has been suggested that blood pressure reduction may be associated with the hydrolysis of casein by lactic acid bacteria found in fermented milk (27346, 27365).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vivo and in vitro research shows antitumor activity of lactobacilli in colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in females who consume fermented milk products (27304, 27366, 27367, 27368, 27369). In a study assessing the effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei) on the growth of breast cancer cells, all fermented milk products showed growth inhibition, although Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days) (27366). It was proposed that the mechanism involved a compound produced by the bacteria during the fermentation process or the microbial transformation of some milk components into a biologically active form. Fermented milk has also been shown to increase natural killer cell tumoricidal activity (27340).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human research, there were significant improvements in blood total antioxidative activity and total antioxidative status indices following use of fermented goat milk (27371).\nBone effects\nFermentation of milk with Lactobacillus helveticus increases serum calcium in postmenopausal females (27334). Milk-derived casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) formed in the gastrointestinal tract or during fermentation appear to enhance calcium absorption by preventing the formation of insoluble calcium salts in the intestine (27334, 27372).\nCholesterol effects\nAlterations in gut microflora induced by the ingestion of fermented milk may influence systemic lipid metabolism (27374). Fermented milk formulations significantly reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in some hypercholesterolemic patients (1240, 27316). However, other clinical research shows no change in serum cholesterol despite significantly lowered cholesterol absorption following ingestion of a fermented milk product compared to lemonade or low-fat milk (27373). Bacteria from fermented milk that take up residence in the large intestine may ferment indigestible carbohydrates, causing increased production of short-chain fatty acids, which decrease circulatory cholesterol concentrations either by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis or by redistributing cholesterol from plasma to the liver. Also, increased bacterial activity in the large intestine may enhance bile acid deconjugation. Deconjugated bile acids are not well absorbed by the gut mucosa and are excreted. Cholesterol, a precursor of bile acids, is then utilized to a greater extent for denovo bile acid synthesis (8559).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is evidence that fermented milk containing certain bacterial cultures may affect Helicobacter pylori infection or its activity and the emergence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in adults and children (27308, 27310). Studies in humans have shown that fermented milk may be effective for treating and maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and constipation (12775, 14338, 27315, 27321, 27322, 27325, 27326). Consumption of fermented milk increases total Bifidobacterium and lactobacilli in the feces or colon, and decreases clostridia and other pathogenic bacteria (27339, 27351, 27375, 27376, 27389, 27398, 27400, 27701). These changes result in an increased defecation frequency in healthy Japanese females (27375). Consumption of a fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 shortens the colonic transit time in healthy females. However, the effect does not appear to be due to modifications of the fecal bacterial mass or secondary bile acids (27377). Fermented milk products have also been shown to slow gastric emptying (27311, 27312).\nImmune effects\nAdministration of fermented milk containing certain bacterial strains may suppress infections by improving nutritional and immunological status in humans (27342, 27378, 27380, 27381, 27382). According to various types of laboratory research, mechanisms that may be responsible include induction of interferon production (27383), modulation of the number of lymphocytes and CD56 cells in humans (27379), increase in phagocytosis of pathogens (27384), increase in oxidative burst capacity of monocytes (27340, 27385), and activation of natural killer cells (NK) through IL-12 signaling (27340, 27341, 27386, 27387, 27388). However, a small number of studies have reported that fermented milk intake does not change immune function, such as natural killer cell activity, IgE, phagocytosis, or cytokine or T helper cell production (25488, 27335, 27389).\n\nLactic acid bacteria may reinforce the nonspecific immune defense and also specific immunity, particularly the secretory immune system mediated by secretory IgA or IgM in response to particulate infectious antigens and perhaps soluble food antigens (27360). Fermented milk may alter serum IgE concentration, at least partly by enhancement of Th1 immune responses in humans with high concentrations of serum IgE (27355). Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG therapy has been associated with a significantly enhanced nonspecific humoral response during the acute phase of infection, reflected in the IgG, IgA, and IgM Ig-secreting cell numbers (27306, 27381, 27390).\n\nStudies in animals and humans indicate that consumption of fermented milk cultures containing lactic acid bacteria may enhance production of type I and type II interferons at the systemic level, promote interferon expression, and reduce allergen-stimulated production of IL-4 and IL-5 (27393). Lactic acid bacteria are potent inducers of some cytokines (IL-12 and IL-18). Secretion of these compounds is stimulated by the interaction of the bacterial cell wall components with receptors on the surface of cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Other possible mechanisms involve a stimulating effect of intestinal cells, anti-inflammatory effects, and a downregulatory mechanism in cow's milk allergy (27360). It has been reported that the persistence of fermented milk bacteria in the colon may not be required for all forms of immune effects related to fermented milk (27391). The body does not appear to mount an antibody response to bacteria present in fermented milk (27392).\nLactose intolerance\nClinical research suggests that bacteria in fermented milk products improve lactose digestion and reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance (27345, 27346). This occurs due to microbial enzymes that break down lactose to glucose and galactose, delayed gastrointestinal transit, positive effects on intestinal functions and colonic microflora, and reduced sensitivity to symptoms (8517)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of feverfew.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of feverfew is the leaf. At least 39 constituents of feverfew have been identified (724). However, there has been controversy regarding which constituents are responsible for feverfew's pharmacological effects. Previously, it was widely believed that the sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide, was the active constituent (6935). Sesquiterpene lactone concentrations have been found to be ~0.5% in feverfew ethanol extracts, and ~0.3% in aqueous extracts (parthenolide, being the principal sesquiterpene lactone in these preparations) (42870). However, this constituent does not appear to be necessary for effectiveness (6935, 6938, 6959, 6960, 6961). Other possible active agents found in feverfew include melatonin (50) and tanetin, a lipophilic flavonoid glycoside (6941). Other lipophilic flavonoids in feverfew leaves and flowers include methyl ethers of the flavonols 6-hydroxykaempferol and quercetagetin; vacuolar flavonoids include apigenin and luteolin 7-glucuronides (6946). Monoterpenes, including alpha-pinene, camphene, limonene, gamma-terpinene, beta-ocimene, linalool, p-cymene, chrysanthenol, camphor, and chrysanthenyl acetate, make up the majority of volatiles emitted from the aerial parts of feverfew plants (39562).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFeverfew appears to have anti-inflammatory effects (6941, 6947). Feverfew might also inhibit serum proteases and leukotrienes (6939, 6946). Feverfew also appears to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting phospholipase, which prevents the release of arachidonic acid (6943, 6953, 6954). Parthenolide seems to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1, and IL-8, as well as prevent NF-kappaB activation (12483, 49904, 49922, 49926, 49929). In laboratory research, the feverfew constituents parthenolide, michefuscalide, and chrysanthenyl acetate inhibited prostaglandin synthetase-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (6713).\n\nIn animal research, feverfew extract had both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects unrelated to opioid receptors (6947). Modulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression may be an alternate mechanism of anti-inflammatory action (49895, 49900). Although parthenolide is considered to be an active anti-inflammatory constituent, laboratory research suggests that parthenolide-depleted feverfew also has anti-inflammatory effects, such as the inhibition of proinflammatory enzymes, cytokines, and prostaglandins (19213).\nAnti-migraine effects\nIt was suggested that at least 0.2% of parthenolide was required for efficacy for migraine (6935, 6937). However, a study using an alcoholic extract of feverfew standardized to 0.35% parthenolide was found ineffective for preventing migraine (6938), suggesting that parthenolide may not be the active ingredient and that other constituents are necessary for benefit in the prevention of migraine (49, 6935, 6938). It's not yet clear how feverfew works in the prevention of migraine. Laboratory evidence suggests that feverfew extracts might inhibit platelet aggregation and inhibit serotonin release from platelets and leucocytes (6935, 6936, 6942, 6943, 6944, 6945). However, platelet studies in people have not found this effect (6951). Feverfew might also inhibit serum proteases and leukotrienes (6939, 6946). Feverfew also appears to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting phospholipase, which prevents the release of arachidonic acid (6943, 6953, 6954). Parthenolide seems to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 (12483). Preliminary research shows that extracts of fresh feverfew leaves and parthenolide might cause irreversible inhibition of vascular muscle contraction (6948, 6950, 49945). Chrysanthenyl acetate, an essential oil of feverfew, has been suggested as one active component (6938). Chrysanthenyl acetate inhibits prostaglandin synthetase and might have analgesic properties (6713, 12153). Feverfew also contains melatonin which might contribute to its pharmacological effect (50). Fresh or dried leaves contain significantly more melatonin than commercially prepared standardized feverfew tablets (50). Migraine attacks have been associated with decreased melatonin excretion (6712).\nAnticancer effects\nFeverfew and its constituents appear to inhibit tumor cell growth as shown in laboratory research (6957, 39621, 49906, 49911, 49915, 49925). Feverfew also appears to induce apoptosis (49907, 49908, 49909, 49915, 49918, 49924). The anti-cancer effects of feverfew or its constituents are not clear. In laboratory research, the constituent parthenolide modulated the activities of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (49906, 49909) and NF-kappaB (49903, 49909, 49915, 49930). The inhibition of NF-kappa B resulted in the downregulation of genes related to cancer, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and metastasis, such as Bcl-X(L), interleukin-8, survivin, cyclin D1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (49930).\nAntihistamine effect\nFeverfew is traditionally used for allergies. In laboratory research in rat peritoneal mast cells, feverfew extract demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of histamine release (49933)."

In a rat model of thrombosis, ficin decreased the size of infarcted regions, delaying thrombus formation and dissolving those already present (112759).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that ficin can disrupt the biofilm backbone of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and, as a result, can enhance the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics against these bacteria (100605).\nAntiparasitic effects\nSome preliminary laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that ficin might be useful in treating helminthiasis (11, 3766).

Purified ficin has much more potent anthelmintic activity than the crude latex.

The latex or sap from the leaves contains ficin, a proteolytic enzyme that causes itching, as well as other enzymes (12690, 99961). This sap is also found in the branches and fruit skin (99961). The compounds present in the latex, and their quantities, vary with the time of year the latex is harvested (108930). Both the leaves and fruit contain flavonoids, anthocyanins, and other phenolic compounds. Specific constituents of both leaves and fruit differ between varieties (99954, 99955, 99956, 99958, 99959, 99960). The fruit also contains coumarins, saponins, and terpenes (99957, 99959).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLatex from fig fruit seems to have cytotoxic activity and inhibits proliferation of some cancer cells (12579).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nFig fruit is traditionally used for diarrhea. In vitro, an extract of the dried ripe fruit demonstrated spasmolytic effects possibly mediated by potassium channels (99957).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAn aqueous extract of fig leaf can reduce blood sugar in animals and humans with type 1 diabetes (6625, 12578, 99953). It may improve glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis by downregulating gluconeogenic enzymes (12578, 99953). In vitro, fig fruit extract inhibits various enzymes, including alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase (99954). Other research in an animal model of type 1 diabetes shows that fig leaf extracts or fig leaf and bud extracts lower blood glucose and oxidative stress levels and improve lipid profiles, liver enzyme levels, and kidney function (108929, 116049).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that a chitin-binding protein present in fig latex extract has antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, T. soudanense, Microsporum canis, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Cryptococcus neoformans (108930).\nAntiparasitic effects\nCysteine proteinases in fig latex have activity against rodent intestinal worms including Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia obvelata, and Trichuris muris. Two latex furocoumarins, 5- and 8-methoxypsoralen, have activity against the larvae of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti (108930). However, research in animals with cutaneous leishmaniasis shows that applying a topical gel containing fig latex 5% once or twice daily for 3 weeks does not significantly reduce the size of the lesions (108930).\nDermatological effects\nFig leaves are traditionally used in the treatment of various skin disorders. In vitro in keratinocytes, fig leaf extract inhibits the gene expression of various inflammatory mediators (99955).\nLaxative effects\nFig fruit has laxative effects. In animal research it increases the production of mucin and induces peristalsis. This leads to improved stool consistency and shortened colonic transit time. However, fig fruit doesn't seem to increase the number of bowel movements in humans (99956).\nLipid effects\nFigs seem to lower blood lipid levels. In an animal model, fig leaves lowered triglyceride levels, possibly by altering lipid metabolism (12839, 99953). This effect was thought to be related to the antioxidant activity of the constituents vitexin, dihydroxybenzoic acid di-pentoside, and rutin (99959).\nPhotosensitizing effects\nFig tree branches, leaves, and fruit skin exude a milky sap containing proteolytic enzymes and the furocoumarins psoralen and bergapten. When activated by ultraviolet radiation, these compounds can cause phytophotodermatitis (116050)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of fireweed are the above ground parts and roots (96289, 110697). Fireweed contains polyphenols, including flavonols and flavonoids, organic and phenolic acids, and tannins. Miquelianin is one of the main flavonoids. Oenotheins A and B are high molecular weight polyphenols. Oenothein B is found in high levels and likely contributes to at least some of its clinical effects (96289).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn animal research, fireweed extract has analgesic effects (96289).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that aqueous extracts of fireweed have anti-inflammatory effects (859, 860). In animal research, fireweed extracts reduce paw edema. The anti-inflammatory effects of fireweed are likely related to the constituent oenothein B. Oenothein B has been shown to inhibit the activation of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory mediators (96289).\nAnticancer effects\nIn laboratory research, fireweed extract has anticancer effects, resulting in decreased growth and increased apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and astrocytoma cells. The constituent oenothein B induces the enzyme neutral endopeptidase in vitro. This enzyme is involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation. Oenothein B also induces apoptosis in tumor cell lines and stimulates their destruction via increased immune response in animal and in vitro models (96289).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a rat model of diabetes, an ethanol extract of fireweed given for 21 days reduces weight loss, blood glucose levels, and oxidative stress damage, and increases insulin levels (110698).\nAntimicrobial effects\nFireweed extract has antibacterial and antifungal effects in vitro. The constituent oenothein B has shown inhibitory effects against Helicobacter pylori and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as against certain species of fungus (96289).\nAntiviral effects\nIn animal research, fireweed extract increases survival following exposure to the influenza virus. The constituent oenothein B has been shown to have antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus (96289).\nProstate effects\nLaboratory research suggests that extracts and constituents of fireweed might have beneficial effects on the prostate, possibly through downregulation of androgen production, inhibition of prostate specific antigen synthesis, suppression of NF-kB expression, antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities, and alleviation of inflammatory and oxidative stressors in prostate tissue (96289, 99860, 110697). Laboratory models show that oenothein B, a constituent of fireweed, inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme plays a role in some prostate disorders (96289). In vitro research also shows that extracts of fireweed inhibit prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) epithelial-1 cell growth, while animal research shows that fireweed extracts can decrease prostate size, reduce dihydrotestosterone levels, and inhibit 5-alpha-reductase activity in rat models of BPH. Many constituents of fireweed appear to have anti-BPH effects, and some seem to be more potent than finasteride, with gallic acid being the most potent overall (99860).\nReproductive effect\nPreliminary evidence suggests that aqueous extracts of fireweed might affect the development of accessory sexual organs in male rats (858)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Fish oil comes from a variety of fish and is a source of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (90039). It is available as a prescription drug or as a dietary supplement. The potency and quality of omega-3 fatty acids in supplements can vary. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved qualified health claims for fish oil supplements for hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention. Fish oil is also used parenterally (1004, 1034, 65696, 65862, 66042, 66421, 89370, 103497, 103500, 110339)(110340, 110342, 110346, 110348, 110349, 110352); however, this route of administration is not the focus of this topic.",
            "Warnings": "Certain specific fish oil products (Lovaza [formerly known as Omacor], Omtryg, Epanova) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to lower triglyceride levels (90038). Fish oil supplements have not been approved for this use.\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 2004 recognizes fish as a major food allergen in the United States and requires that fish be labeled on packaged food and supplement products (105410).\n\nIn 2023, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency issued a public statement on the use of omega-3-acid ethyl esters, concluding that exposure to omega-3-acid ethyl esters for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease when compared with placebo. The highest risk of atrial fibrillation is associated with a daily dose of 4 grams. If atrial fibrillation occurs, treatment should be permanently discontinued (112467).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Doses of 3 grams per day and less can be safely used by most people. Fish oil has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US (1313, 1024, 2299, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2315, 2317, 4912, 5702)(5705, 5706, 6394, 6399, 7368, 7369, 7380, 12921, 12922, 13011)(13766, 14382, 16733, 17408, 17991, 17992, 66454, 89325, 89336, 89346)(89351, 89352, 89373, 89374, 101543, 103492, 103499, 103502, 104546, 105220)(107180, 107181, 113220). Although higher doses of fish oil, such as 6 grams daily for up to 1 year, have been used safely (89344), there are some safety concerns about using high doses of fish oil. Some older research suggests that doses greater than 3 grams per day can inhibit blood coagulation and potentially increase bleeding risk (8671, 8679, 8696, 66258, 21223, 21224). However, the most rigorous research to date shows that short-term doses of fish oil 10 grams daily and long-term doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 52 weeks do not increase the risk of bleeding or affect coagulation parameters in chronically ill and vulnerable patients (97180). Still, doses greater than 3 grams per day might suppress immune response (1313, 7384). Patients should only take high-dose fish oil while under medical supervision.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when parenteral nutrition supplemented with a lipid emulsion enriched in fish oil is used, short-term. Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid lipid emulsions, administered intravenously for 1-4 weeks, have been safely used (1004, 66042, 66421, 89323, 103497).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when fish oil from dietary sources is consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds. Very frequent consumption of contaminated fish can cause adverse effects such as tremor, numbness and tingling, difficulty concentrating, and vision problems. Avoid frequent consumption of swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), and farm-raised salmon (12964, 12965, 12966).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of fish oil when used topically.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (5708, 5711, 65732, 66070). In adolescents 9 years of age and older, fish oil providing doses of up to 2250 mg omega-3 fatty acids daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks (101543). Fish oil used in enteral feeds for up to 9 months has been shown to be safe in infants (13745). Young children should limit dietary consumption to no more than two ounces of fish per week (12967, 12968). ...when given as part of parenteral nutrition in infants receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (96118, 110340, 110346, 110352).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when fish oil from dietary sources are consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds. Frequent consumption of contaminated fish can cause brain damage, mental retardation, blindness, and seizures in children. Lower levels can cause more subtle problems such as learning disabilities (12964). Young children should limit consumption to no more than 2 ounces per week of fish (12967, 12968).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Intake of fish oil during pregnancy does not appear to adversely affect the fetus or nursing infant (1026, 1027, 1042, 8706, 12969, 12970, 12971, 12972, 12973, 14397)(15015, 15162, 101540, 110338, 113217, 114181). One large clinical trial shows that intake of fish oil from the 24th week of gestation increases the odds of the child having overweight and having metabolic syndrome measurements at age 10 when compared with placebo (114181). More research is needed to confirm these findings. The adequate intake level of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy is 1.4 grams daily; the adequate intake level during lactation is 1.3 grams daily (89377). If possible, people who are trying to become pregnant, as well as those who are pregnant or lactating, should avoid swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), as these may contain high levels of methylmercury. Pregnant individuals should also limit consumption of other fatty fish to 12 ounces, or about 3-4 servings, per week.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when fish oil from dietary sources are consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and parenterally, fish oil is generally well-tolerated. Topically, no adverse effects have been reported. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bad breath, fishy aftertaste, heartburn, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, loose stools, nausea, and rash.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Atrial fibrillation. When taken in doses of 3 grams or more daily, there are rare reports of increased risk of bleeding and stroke, as well as immune suppression.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, fish oil supplements in doses of 3-10 grams daily can cause a dose-dependent increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in some people (2299, 2318, 8678, 8698, 15734, 15735, 48120, 65729) by increasing the size of LDL particles (9771). Therefore, LDL levels should be monitored in people who take fish oil supplements (15734). But fish oil doesn't seem to cause development of atherosclerosis, despite earlier concerns that polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids, might increase the oxidation of LDL (1011, 2323, 7165, 7366, 8695, 8700, 9771).\n\nThere is concern that fish oil supplements may be associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF). In one large clinical study (the STRENGTH trial), taking a prescription fish oil product (Epanova) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years was associated with an increased risk for AF, with a number needed to harm of 114 when compared with a corn oil control. The patients in this study were considered to be at high risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD) (103491). Also, one large population study in adults without CVD suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a modestly higher risk of both atrial fibrillation and stroke when compared with non-use of fish oil supplements (114182).\n\nIn a secondary analysis of the Omega-3 fatty acids in Elderly patients with Myocardial Infarction (OMEMI) trial, adults aged 70-82 years with recent myocardial infarction supplementing with 1.8 grams daily of n-3 PUFA (EPA/DHA) for 24 months had a 90% increased risk of developing AF or micro-AF, which is characterized by short, AF-like activity lasting less than 30 seconds. Changes in serum EPA levels seem to mediate this risk, with higher serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of AF and intermediate serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of micro-AF (112469).\n\nMeta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements increases the incidence rate ratio for AF by up to 37% when compared with placebo, with an increased incidence rate associated with doses of more than 1 gram daily. One study in these analyses used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone as purified icosapent ethyl (106075, 107171, 107181).\n\nIn 2023, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency issued a public statement on the use of omega-3-acid ethyl esters, concluding that exposure to omega-3-acid ethyl esters for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of AF in patients with established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease when compared with placebo. The highest risk of AF is associated with a dose of 4 grams daily. If AF occurs, treatment should be permanently discontinued (112467).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, skin rashes, itching, and skin irritation have been reported (66498, 66492, 66488, 89369, 104551).\n\nA case of severe tissue inflammation and breast tissue necrosis has been reported for a female who injected fish oil from capsules subcutaneously for breast augmentation (89371).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, most adverse effects of omega-3 fatty acids are gastrointestinal in nature (12915, 65599, 65728, 65770, 65780, 65904, 66061, 66104, 66164, 66488)(89347, 89357, 103491, 103551, 107172, 114184). Gastrointestinal upset is common with the use of fish oil supplements, occurring in up to 5% of patients in clinical trials, with nausea in up to 1.5% of patients (2307, 16733, 65599, 65732, 65762, 65830, 65886, 65925, 65974)(66020, 66042, 66083, 66104, 66130, 66164, 66169, 66358, 66370, 66488)(66494, 66498, 89347, 103491, 104551, 110353, 114184). Diarrhea and loose stools may also occur (6257, 10871, 65599, 65648, 65830, 65935, 66042, 66061, 66104, 66119)(66130, 66173, 66492, 89347, 89359, 103491, 104551, 107172, 110353), with potentially severe diarrhea at very high doses (12986, 16901, 66093, 66356). There have also been reports of increased burping (17963, 65648, 65729, 65770, 65830, 66020, 66042, 66077, 66164, 66169)(66492, 66494, 104551, 114184), acid reflux, heartburn (104551, 110338), indigestion (65566, 65830, 66061, 66104, 66173, 89359, 114184), abdominal bloating (66083, 66104), abdominal or gastrointestinal pain or discomfort (8680, 17996, 66119, 66492, 103491), anorexia (62390, 89359), flatulence (66492), constipation (16901), nausea and vomiting (65728, 65830, 66104, 66130, 66488, 103491, 104551), steatorrhea (66119, 66354, 66356), fishy hiccups (66488), metallic taste (66488), and a fishy breath odor and aftertaste (16901, 65648, 65729, 65762, 66020, 66042, 66061, 66077, 66083, 66104)(66130, 66164, 66172, 66173, 66424, 66488, 66494, 89369, 104551, 107172). Also, some preliminary evidence suggests that increased serum levels of omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, might increase the risk for atrophic gastritis (8709).\n\nGastrointestinal side effects may be minimized if fish oils are taken with meals and if doses are started low and gradually increased. Taking supplements with meals or freezing them seems to help decrease these side effects for some patients (12975). Enteric coated fish products might also help reduce side effects (6258).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, 3 grams or greater of omega-3 fatty acids daily may inhibit platelet aggregation and increase the risk of bleeding; however, there is little evidence of statistically significant bleeding risk at lower doses (1313, 8699, 66500, 66501, 66334, 101543). Very large intakes of fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids (more than 46 grams per day) may increase the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic (bleeding) stroke (7603, 66502).\n\nA case of hemolytic anemia has been reported for an infant with short bowel syndrome who developed liver disease from total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and was switched to a specific TPN with fish oil (Omegaven, Fresenius-Kabi, Graz, Austria) instead. After stopping the fish oil-TPN, the anemia was reversed suggesting that parenteral fish oil might cause hemolytic anemia (66022).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, mild elevations in liver function tests, such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported rarely (66353, 113218).\nless\nImmunologic\nA case of anaphylaxis following ingestion of a fish oil capsule has been reported for a female patient with a history of allergy to crab. The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, but had several recurrences of stridor over the next 2 days (89378).\n\nThere is also some evidence that fish oil in doses greater than 3 grams per day might adversely affect immune function. Fish oil appears to suppress T- and B-cell function and to reduce the production of cytokines, which might be detrimental to elderly people and people with suppressed immune function such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1313, 7383, 7384).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, fish oil may cause headache, dizziness, and inability to sleep (65599, 65648, 89359, 103491, 104551). Also, restlessness and formication have been reported in less than 1% of studied cases of patients taking fish oil (66498).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that high fish intake may increase the risk for certain types of cancer. One large epidemiological study has found that dietary intake of fish oil from fatty fish twice a week or more is associated with a 16% increased risk of breast cancer when compared with eating fatty fish less than twice weekly (107175). Additionally, an analysis of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort study in over 491,000 older adults, has found that total intake of fish is associated with increased melanoma risk over a median follow-up of 15.5 years. When the lowest and highest quintiles of intake are compared, there is a 22% increase in the risk for malignant melanoma and a 28% increase in the risk for melanoma in situ. In sub-group analyses, all melanoma incidence is positively associated with tuna intake or non-fried fish intake, but malignant melanoma incidence is inversely associated with fried fish intake (108509). It was suggested that the positive associations could be due to contaminants in fish such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, arsenic, and mercury.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, fish oil has been reported to cause nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections in 3.3% of patients in one clinical trial (65798). Exacerbation of asthma and apnea have been reported for patients using fish oil (1040, 66061, 66119, 66354).\nless\nOther\nFish oil can contribute to caloric intake and may cause weight gain if used long-term. One gram of fat or oil provides 9 kcal (6871). Fish oil capsules containing 500 mg omega-3 fatty acids in 1 gram of oil would supply about 13.5 kcal per capsule (6871, 6874). Fish oil supplements also contain cholesterol in amounts from 1-6 mg per gram of fish oil (3022, 6871).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nHypertriglyceridemia. Oral prescription fish oil products reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, especially in severe cases. Oral fish oil supplements may reduce triglyceride levels when used in very high doses of up to 12 capsules per dose.\nFish oil can reduce triglyceride levels by 20% to 50% (1024, 2299, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2315, 2317, 5702, 5705, 5706)(6394, 6399, 7368, 7369, 7380, 12921, 12922, 13011, 13766, 65846)(66154, 65504, 66370, 66156, 66338, 65589, 66221, 66257, 66278, 98004, 100253). The effect is dose-dependent and greatest in individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels of 500 mg/dL and above) (5706, 7380, 65846, 66278, 100253). However, fish oil might be less effective than fibrates. One clinical study shows that fish oil in doses of 4 grams daily is not as effective as gemfibrozil (Lopid) 1200 mg daily (7377). For patients with hypertriglyceridemia associated with the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP), which is thought to be a marker for cardiovascular disease, taking fish oil 6 grams daily might reduce triglyceride levels by 35% (8683). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil might also reduce fatty liver disease and serum transaminase levels associated with hypertriglyceridemia (13755).\n\nThree specific fish oil preparations (Lovaza, formerly known as Omacor, GlaxoSmithKline; Omtryg, Trygg Pharma, Inc.; Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals), are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as an adjunct to diet to lower triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (12982, 96117). These prescription-only products are typically used at dosages of 4 grams providing 3.4-3.6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily (98004). When a 4-gram daily dose is used, triglycerides are lowered by about 20% to 30%. When a 2-gram daily dose is used, the triglyceride-lowering effect is reduced by about half (100253). In 2019, the American Heart Association (AHA) stated that prescription fish oil products, taken in doses of 4 grams daily, are clinically useful for lowering triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or severe hypertriglyceridemia (100253).\n\nFish oil supplements have also shown benefit in clinical research when used in doses ranging from 1-15 grams daily for up to 6 months, or when providing EPA 1.45 to 2.7 grams and DHA 1.05 to 1.8 grams daily for 2 to 12 weeks (1024, 2301, 2315, 2317, 5705, 5707, 6394, 6399, 7368, 7369)(8683, 13766, 65589, 66156, 66257, 66370). However, some experts view these forms of fish oil as inadequate, as the omega-3 fatty acid content of fish oil supplements is usually lower and often variable compared to prescription fish oil. Often, up to 12 capsules of fish oil supplements daily may be needed to produce the same triglyceride-lowering effect as prescription fish oil (98004). In 2019, the AHA did not recommend for or against the use of fish oil supplements for hypertriglyceridemia (100253).\n\nThere is limited evidence regarding the effects of fish oil in younger patients with hypertriglyceridemia (100253). Two small clinical studies in adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia show that fish oil supplements 4 grams daily for 2-6 months do not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (89339, 100253). However, the lack of benefit in this patient population might be due to the small study sizes or due to potential underlying genetic resistance to treatment.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAngioplasty. Oral fish oil seems to prevent restenosis when started at least 3 weeks before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking fish oil orally prevents restenosis after PTCA (13750, 66376, 65569). Also, clinical research shows that fish oil decreases restenosis rate by up to 45% when given for at least three weeks before PTCA and continued for one month thereafter (8680, 65614). In these clinical trials, two different dosing regimens were used; fish oil 6 grams daily starting at least one month before PTCA and continuing one month after PTCA, followed by 3 grams of fish oil daily for 6 months thereafter (8680); and fifteen 1 gram capsules of fish oil (containing 2.7 grams of EPA 1.8 grams of DHA daily) daily starting 3 weeks before PTCA and continuing for 6 months thereafter (65614). When given for two weeks or less before PTCA, fish oil doesn't seem to have any effect on restenosis (1028, 1038, 2320, 65462, 66390, 65626, 66203, 66212), although some conflicting evidence exists (66202).\nless\nCachexia. Oral fish oil in doses of 7.5-8.1 grams daily seems to slow weight loss in patients with cachexia. Lower doses might not be effective.\nTaking a high-dose fish oil supplement seems to slow weight loss in some patients with cancer-related cachexia (11979, 62390). Lower doses (3 grams daily) do not seem to have any effect (10008). Higher doses (7.5-8.1 grams daily) have come from a specific fish oil preparation (ACO Omega-3, Pharmacia) 30 mL providing EPA 4.9 grams and DHA 3.2 grams daily for 4 weeks (62390), or fish oil 7.5 grams daily providing EPA 4.7 grams and DHA 2.8 grams for a median of 5 weeks (11979). There is also preliminary evidence that a product providing protein 32 grams, EPA 2.18 grams, and DHA 1.92 grams daily for up to 7 weeks might help to improve appetite and increase lean body mass in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (5701). In contrast, a meta-analysis of three studies in cancer patients shows that taking fish oil for 4-25 weeks does not seem to prevent loss of fat-free mass or body weight, or prevent a decrease in upper arm circumference, when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear how many of the included patients had malnutrition and/or weight loss (106070).\nless\nCyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Oral fish oil seems to prevent cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.\nSome clinical research shows that taking fish oil orally seems to significantly improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow in individuals taking cyclosporine after kidney or liver transplant (1021, 66187). Taking fish oil orally also seems to improve kidney function during the recovery phase following a rejection episode in kidney transplant recipients taking cyclosporine when compared with coconut oil (65590). In addition, another clinical study shows that taking fish oil modestly improves kidney function in patients following a recent kidney transplant (66472). Doses used in these studies include fish oil 12 grams, containing 18% EPA and 12% DHA, daily for 2 months following liver transplant or fish oil 3-6 grams, usually containing 30% EPA and 20% DHA, daily for up to 12 months following kidney transplant (1021, 66187, 65590, 66472).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral fish oil seems to reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea.\nClinical research in adolescents and adults with dysmenorrhea shows that taking fish oil, alone or in combination with vitamin B1 100 mg, vitamin B12 11 mcg, or vitamin E 1.5 mg or 200 IU, seems to decrease pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption, and interference with daily activities (7574, 7575, 15738, 89341, 99367, 107174). Doses of fish oil used in these studies provided EPA 1080 mg and DHA 720 mg daily for up to 2 months or EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily for 5 days (7574, 99367). Alternatively, fish oil 2.5 grams daily for 3-4 months or 500 mg daily for 2 months has been used (7575, 89341).\nless\nHeart failure. Dietary fish oil seems to prevent heart failure. Also, oral fish oil seems to prevent further hospitalization, and possibly mortality, in patients with heart failure.\nDietary fish oil might be beneficial for primary prevention of heart failure. Population research found that higher intake of DIETARY fish oil is associated with a 15% reduced risk of incident heart failure (17994). Based on this data and other population research, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that patients consume 1-2 weekly servings of non-fried fish in place of less healthy protein options to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure (97185). There is not enough available information to know if fish oil SUPPLEMENTS are beneficial for primary prevention of heart failure (93568).\n\nHowever, taking fish oil supplements seems to be beneficial for secondary prevention of outcomes in patients with heart failure. A large population study in patients with heart failure suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a modest reduction in mortality when compared with non-use of fish oil supplements (114182). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 600-4300 mg orally daily for up to 12 months can improve left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac function in patients with non-ischemic chronic heart failure (89373). Another meta-analysis shows that although taking omega-3 fatty acids 961-6000 mg orally daily for up to 6.2 years does not reduce cardiovascular mortality or first hospitalization due to heart failure, recurrent hospitalizations due to heart failure were reduced by approximately 9% when compared with placebo (106061). A large-scale clinical trial (GISSI-HF) also shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing 850-882 mg of EPA and DHA as ethyl esters in a ratio of 1:1.2, for an average of 3.9 years significantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization in patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure. Based on these findings, approximately 56 patients would need to be treated for 3.9 years to prevent one death. Approximately 44 patients would need to be treated for 3.9 years to prevent one cardiovascular-related death or hospitalization (16733). Based on these findings, an AHA science advisory states that it is reasonable to consider supplementation with fish oil 1 gram daily in patients with heart failure (93568).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral fish oil seems to reduce triglyceride levels in patients with this condition. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in these patients.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that supplementation with fish oil reduces triglycerides by 12-99 mg/dL in patients with HIV treatment-related dyslipidemia when compared to control (66177, 66144, 65993). Two capsules of a specific fish oil supplement (Omacor, Pronova BioPharma) containing EPA 460 mg plus DHA 380 mg twice daily for 12 weeks has been used in one study (65993). The effect of fish oil on total cholesterol levels is mixed, with some evidence showing a decrease in total cholesterol of 14 mg/dL (66177), while other evidence suggests that fish oil does not affect total cholesterol levels in these patients (65993, 89359). An observational cohort study has found that taking fish oil is associated with reduced triglyceride levels in patients with HIV and hypertriglyceridemia, with overall effects similar to statins but less than fibrates (89354).\nless\nHypertension. Oral fish oil seems to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with moderate or severe hypertension. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension or in those using antihypertensive drugs.\nMost clinical research shows that taking fish oil produces modest but significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with moderate or severe hypertension (1020, 2301, 66215, 66095). In patients with mild hypertension, however, the evidence is mixed (1001, 66385, 66180). The discrepancy regarding the hypotensive effect of fish oil in individuals with mild hypertension may result from the type of fish oil used for treatment (66180). Meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that, in general, fish oil reduces systolic blood pressure by 2.5-5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.5-3.5 mmHg in individuals with hypertension (66358, 66379, 89324, 89350). In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that consuming EPA and DHA in combination may be beneficial for moderating blood pressure and reducing the risk of hypertension in the general population. However, the FDA noted that this claim is based on inconsistent and inconclusive evidence (102372).\n\nIt is unclear whether fish oil is beneficial in people who are already using antihypertensive drugs. Some clinical research suggests that taking fish oil 5 grams daily for 6 weeks does not further improve the hypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors in individuals being treated for hypertension (66359), while other research suggests that fish oil decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals currently taking beta-blockers or diuretics (66331, 66100). However, taking fish oil does not seem to significantly improve blood pressure in individuals with hypertension that remains uncontrolled despite the use of antihypertensive drugs (66418).\n\nClinical trials showing blood pressure-lowering effects have used fish oil 4-15 grams daily, in single or divided doses, for up to 36 weeks, or fish oil providing EPA 2.04 grams and DHA 1.4 grams daily (1001, 1020, 2301, 66100, 66180, 66331, 66385). Omega-3 fatty acids 3-15 grams daily for 4 weeks have also been used (66215). There is conflicting evidence regarding whether the hypotensive effect of fish oil is dose-dependent (66358, 66379, 89350).\n\nOther research has assessed whether fish oil affects the risk of developing additional cardiometabolic disorders in adults with hypertension. In a cohort of over 81,500 patients followed for 9 years, those who consumed fish oil as supplements or in the diet at baseline had a 9%, 11%, and 14% reduction, respectively, in the risk for diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cardiac death, when compared with those with hypertension who did not consume fish oil (108508).\nless\nIgA nephropathy. When used for 2-4 years, oral fish oil seems to slow the rate of renal function loss in high-risk patients. It is unclear if oral fish oil slows renal function loss when used for shorter time periods or in low-risk patients.\nSome clinical research shows that long-term use (2-4 years) of fish oil 1-12 grams daily can slow the rate of renal function loss in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy (8686, 8711, 66343, 65615). However, short-term use may not be as effective. Some research shows that fish oil 4-6 grams daily for 6 months does not attenuate the loss of renal function (66351, 65593), although a combination of fish oil 3 grams containing 85% EPA plus DHA daily plus renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB) for 6 months seems to reduce proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy when compared with RASB alone (65887). The conflicting data regarding the effect of fish oil on IgA nephropathy has been attributed to different factors. One analysis of clinical evidence suggests that the effects of fish oil on proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy is dose-dependent (65792). Another analysis suggests that the effect of fish oil may be beneficial in only IgA nephropathy patients with more proteinuria (66455).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral fish oil seems to reduce liver steatosis in adults and children with NAFLD.\nMeta-analyses of mainly small clinical studies show that taking omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil or seal oil reduces serum liver enzymes and liver fat when compared with control treatment in patients with NAFLD (98258, 103498). However, these analyses are limited by the heterogeneity and small size of the available studies. In one small clinical trial not included in these analyses, taking fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 735 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1605 mg daily for 3 months modestly reduces triglyceride levels and waist circumference when compared with control. However, insulin and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were only reduced when fish oil was used in combination with vitamin D 1680 IU daily. There was no effect of fish oil on other liver, glycemic, or lipid parameters (107186). In one meta-analysis, omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil were used in a median dose of 2.7 grams daily for an average of 6 months (98258).\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil might also benefit children with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids modestly improves steatosis grade in children with NAFLD when compared with placebo (98241). Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. Also review effectiveness in MASLD, a similar condition.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral fish oil seems to reduce pain and stiffness in patients with RA; however, oral fish oil does not seem to be beneficial for RA prevention when used alone.\nTaking fish oil orally, alone or in combination with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen, seems to significantly decrease the duration of morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with RA (1017, 1039, 1041, 12924, 12925, 15738, 65629, 66313, 66352, 66191) (66248). Use of fish oil might also reduce NSAID requirements when used concomitantly (1031, 15738, 65610). Also, taking omega-3 fatty acids 5.5 grams daily for 12 months upon initiating treatment with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine may slow time to conventional therapy failure and decrease time to first remission in patients with early onset RA (89362). In this clinical research, fish oil 10 grams daily for 6 months or fish oil preparations containing EPA 0.5-4.6 grams and DHA 0.2-3 grams, sometimes along with vitamin E 15 IU, have been used daily for up to 15 months (1017, 1031, 1039, 1041, 12924, 12925, 15738, 65610, 66352, 66191, 66248).\n\nThe effect of oral fish oil on RA prevention has also been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable RA when compared with placebo. However, the risk of RA is reduced by 77% when fish oil is taken in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily (107184). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as RA was relatively small.\nless\nGastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting. Oral fish oil during pregnancy seems to be beneficial for preventing gastroenteritis in early childhood. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for gastroenteritis prevention or treatment in children or adults.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil 2.4 grams daily (Incromega TG33/22, Croda Health Care), containing 55% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 37% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), from week 24 of pregnancy until one week postpartum reduces the number of days of gastroenteritis in the first 3 years of the child's life by 2.5 days or 14% when compared with an olive oil control. There was also a 16% reduction in the number of gastroenteritis episodes and a 20% reduced risk of having a gastroenteritis episode. A sub-analysis suggests that benefits are limited to the winter months and to the children of mothers with the lowest blood levels of EPA and DHA (107182). More research is needed to determine the effect of fish oil in children or adults.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent the incidence or progression of AMD. However, eating fish regularly might help to reduce the risk of AMD.\nThe best available clinical research shows that fish oil supplements (Omacor) are not beneficial for preventing AMD or its progression. A large, high-quality clinical study in over 25,800 adults at least 50 years of age shows that taking fish oil providing DHA 450 mg and EPA 550 mg daily for 3.8 to 6.1 years, with or without vitamin D, does not prevent AMD or its progression (105214). Other clinical research shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 350 mg and EPA 650 mg daily for up to 6.1 years does not prevent the development of advanced AMD (60281). Also, clinical research shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 840 mg and EPA 270 mg by mouth daily for 3 years does not prevent choroidal neovascularization in patients with AMD (89369).\n\nHowever, regular consumption of fish might be beneficial for preventing the incidence or progression of AMD. Observational research has found that consuming dietary fish more than once weekly is associated with a reduced risk of developing age-related maculopathy or AMD (6260, 65724, 65725, 65889). Also, a meta-analysis of observational research has found a 6% and 22% decreased risk of early or late AMD, respectively, for every gram increase in dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake, and a 13% and 14% decreased risk, respectively, for every 15-gram daily increase in fish intake. Sub-analyses found 9% to 15% decreased risks for early or late AMD per 0.15 grams daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), but not alpha-linolenic acid. Although research examining the relationship between omega-3 intake and AMD progression is limited, the highest consumption of dietary fish is associated with a 36% lower risk of AMD progression when compared with the lowest consumption (107176).\nless\nAngina. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with angina.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil supplements does not improve mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with angina (66255). In fact, some evidence suggests that fish oil supplements or increasing oily fish intake might increase the risk of cardiac death by 26% and sudden cardiac death by 54% in males with angina (17988). More evidence is needed before this potential risk can be confirmed.\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral fish oil does not seem to attenuate atherosclerosis progression.\nMost research shows that fish oil supplementation does not attenuate atherosclerosis progression when compared with placebo (1022, 8681). Also, fish oil doesn't seem to improve luminal diameter (1022, 2311) or decrease intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries in people with coronary artery disease (CAD) (8681). However, some research disagrees. One clinical study in adults with CAD shows that taking fish oil supplements 6 grams daily for 3 months and then 3 grams daily for 21 months modestly slows the progression, or causes mild to moderate regression, of atherosclerosis as measured by angiography (2311).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral fish oil does not seem to treat or prevent atopic dermatitis.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil is not effective for TREATING established atopic dermatitis (13758, 66151, 13758). Also, despite conflicting results from preliminary clinical research (12971, 17409), higher quality clinical studies show that fish oil does not PREVENT eczema development. A meta-analysis of clinical research, as well as results from more recent clinical trials, show that maternal supplementation or infant supplementation with fish oil does not reduce the risk of eczema development in infants or young children (66112, 89338, 89360, 89361, 96120). However, a secondary analysis of one of these clinical studies suggests that the risk may vary by maternal genotype (115737). However, some population research suggests that eating fish in early childhood is associated with a reduced risk of developing childhood eczema (65992).\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of new or recurrent atrial fibrillation. Some clinical research suggests that high-dose fish oil may actually increase the risk for new atrial fibrillation.\nAlthough some population research has found that consuming fish as part of the diet is associated with a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (12055), most evidence from epidemiological and clinical research suggests that eating fatty fish or taking fish oil supplements does not reduce the risk of new onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation (12919, 17995, 66101, 89357, 105209, 106075, 107171, 107181, 109306, 110332).\n\nRecent research suggests that consuming fish oil increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, particularly at higher doses. In 2023, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency issued a public statement on the use of omega-3-acid ethyl esters, concluding that exposure to omega-3-acid ethyl esters for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors for CVD when compared with placebo. The highest risk of atrial fibrillation is associated with a dose of 4 grams daily (112467). Additionally, one large, high-quality clinical study (the STRENGTH trial) in patients at high risk for CVD shows that taking a prescription fish oil product (Epanova) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years is associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation, with a number needed to harm of 114 when compared with a corn oil control (103491).\n\nMeta-analyses and a large epidemiological study suggest that taking fish oil supplements at doses over 1 gram daily is associated with a 25% to 37% increased risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with or without CVD, including those with risk factors for CVD, regardless of genetic predisposition (106075, 107171, 107181, 109306). The available meta-analyses are limited by the small number of studies in which atrial fibrillation is the primary endpoint, possibly over-estimating the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplements on atrial fibrillation (110332, 103491).\n\nFish oil also seems to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation after myocardial infarction. In a secondary analysis of the Omega-3 fatty acids in Elderly patients with Myocardial Infarction (OMEMI) trial, adults aged 70-82 years old with recent myocardial infarction supplementing with 1.8 grams daily of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for 24 months had a 90% increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation or micro-atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by short, atrial fibrillation-like activity lasting less than 30 seconds. Changes in serum EPA levels seem to mediate this risk, with higher serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and intermediate serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of micro-atrial fibrillation (112469).\n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of fish oil on recurrent atrial fibrillation following cardioversion. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil 6 grams daily by mouth for one month prior to cardioversion and continuing for up to one year thereafter reduces the absolute risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence by about 39% when compared with placebo (89344). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardioversion (89325). A reason for this discrepancy may be the duration of fish oil supplementation prior to cardioversion. Taking fish oil for at least 4 weeks before cardioversion appears to decrease the absolute risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation by about 18% when compared with placebo, whereas taking fish oil for less than 4 weeks before cardioversion appears to increase the absolute risk of atrial fibrillation by about 6% (89325).\n\nMost clinical research shows that fish oil does not decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery (17996, 89352, 89374). However, it is possible that fish oil formulations containing at least 1 gram of DHA may be beneficial. Evidence from clinical research and analysis of clinical data shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 1 gram or more reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery by about 37% to 72% (89374, 96113). Fish oil containing lower doses of DHA does not appear to be beneficial (89374).\n\nA science advisory statement published by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2017 states that fish oil is not indicated for secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with prior atrial fibrillation or those with atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. The cumulative evidence showed no benefit of fish oil in these populations (93568).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research in over 3,500 preterm infants shows that receiving fish oil daily as part of formula or as a direct oral dose, starting within one month of birth, does not reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with control (102390).\nless\nCerebrovascular disease. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent cerebrovascular disease.\nAlthough a meta-analysis of population studies has found that increased fish consumption lowers the risk of cerebrovascular disease, results from a pooled analysis of clinical trials show that fish oil supplementation does not reduce the risk of primary or secondary cerebrovascular disease (89334).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve cognitive function in most people.\nMost clinical research shows that fish oil supplementation does NOT improve cognitive function in healthy elderly individuals, elderly patients with self-reported cognitive decline, or adults and children (65880, 66030, 66492, 97175, 98248, 103501, 109310). However, fish oil supplementation may modestly help older patients with self-reported cognitive decline to perform daily activities (97181). Also, clinical research in young and middle-aged adults shows that taking a fish oil supplement providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 900 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 360 mg (Accelon EPA EE, BASF) daily for 6 months improves some measures of cognitive function, including overall speed and overall and memory-related accuracy, when compared with both placebo or a fish oil supplement providing DHA 900 mg and EPA 270 mg daily (Accelon DHA EE, BASF). There were no benefits on other measures of cognitive performance (109215). This suggests that any beneficial effects associated with fish oil might be related to the levels or ratio of EPA to DHA or the specific endpoints measured. Observational research has also found conflicting associations between dietary fish and fish oil intake and cognitive function (13747, 15740, 15741, 15742).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral fish oil does not seem to aid in the Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil (Eicosapen) orally, in combination with pantoprazole and clarithromycin, is inferior for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection when compared with a combination of pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole (8710).\nless\nKidney transplant. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve survival or rejection rate following a kidney transplant.\nA meta-analysis of a small number of clinical studies shows that taking fish oil does not improve patient survival, graft survival, or acute rejection rates when compared with placebo following kidney transplant (96121).\nless\nMastalgia. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce chronic breast pain.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil orally 3 grams daily for 6 months does not improve severe chronic breast pain when compared with placebo (9156).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral fish oil does not seem to improve symptoms in patients with MS.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil (MaxEPA) 10 grams containing EPA 1.71 grams and DHA 1.14 grams daily for 2 years does not improve the duration, frequency, or severity of relapses when compared with placebo in patients with MS (66205). Also, in patients with relapsing remitting MS who are taking the medication fingolimod, taking fish oil 1 gram, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, daily for 12 months does not improve levels of inflammatory markers or symptoms of disability when compared with placebo (103502).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve pain or function in patients with osteoarthritis. However, oral fish oil might be beneficial for osteoarthritis-related joint pain in overweight patients.\nClinical research shows that patients with osteoarthritis or knee pain taking low-dose fish oil 0.45 grams daily for 2 years have better pain and function scores when compared with those taking high-dose fish oil 4.5 grams daily (97179). The unexpected improvement in pain and function score in the low-dose fish oil group might be due to a placebo effect. Other clinical research shows that adding fish oil 444 mg to a glucosamine sulfate supplement does not further decrease osteoarthritis symptoms, such as morning stiffness or pain in the hips and knees, when compared with glucosamine alone (65998). In addition, one large study shows that taking fish oil (Omacor) 1 gram daily for an average of 5.3 years has no effect on knee pain due to osteoarthritis when compared with placebo (101548). In contrast to these findings, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking fish oil seems to reduce joint pain (106066). However, only two studies were included in this analysis and both used fish oil in combination with other ingredients, including stinging nettle (76415) and lemon verbena (17748). In addition, one of these studies did not limit to patients with osteoarthritis (17748). Due to the overall negative findings, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends AGAINST the use of fish oil in patients with knee, hip, or hand osteoarthritis (102114).\n\nTaking fish oil might be beneficial for joint pain reduction in a population of older overweight or obese patients with osteoarthritis-specific pain in the knees, lower back, or shoulders. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Blackmores Omega Brain) providing EPA 400 mg and DHA 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces pain by approximately 42%. This is significantly greater than placebo. The overall osteoarthritis burden was reduced by about 40% (103499).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.\nA meta-analysis of 16 moderate-quality, mostly randomized controlled studies in adults shows that taking fish oil 1-3 grams daily, starting in the 12th to 20th week of gestation, reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo (115741). However, some individual clinical studies show that fish oil does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (1042, 89376, 97174, 110338). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be related to the heterogeneous methods across clinical studies, including dose, duration, and timing of therapy initiation.\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk for hypertension during pregnancy.\nClinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (1026, 1027, 12972, 97174, 110338).\nless\nPsychosis. Most research shows that oral fish oil is not beneficial for the treatment or prevention of psychosis.\nAlthough some individual research shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces symptoms of psychosis and the absolute conversion rate to psychotic disorders (17084), most research disagrees (105217, 105554, 109308). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with psychosis shows that taking fish oil does not reduce psychotic symptoms when compared with placebo. However, it might modestly improve function (109308). Doses of fish oil used in the available research have ranged from 570 mg to 3000 mg daily for up to 1 year (17084, 105554, 109308).\nless\nUnstable angina. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent unstable angina.\nIn patients at high cardiovascular risk, taking a fish oil-based preparation (Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years does not prevent unstable angina requiring hospitalization (103491).\nless\nVentricular arrhythmias. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent ventricular arrhythmias or prevent mortality in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias.\nEpidemiological research suggests that eating a diet high in fish has no effect on risk for premature ventricular complexes (12920). Clinical research is inconsistent. In one clinical trial, taking fish oil 2.6 grams daily did not prolong the time to the first event, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or death, in patients with implantable defibrillators. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to therapy for a full 11 months, fish oil treatment did seem to significantly prolong time to first event (14436). Other clinical evidence suggests that taking fish oil 2 grams daily for 1-2 years does not reduce cardiac events such as cardiac defibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, or death from any cause in patients with implantable defibrillators (12986, 14382). Also, other research suggests that taking fish oil supplements might actually increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in some patients with implantable defibrillators (12986). Overall, meta-analyses of clinical studies show that taking fish oil does not reduce implantable defibrillator events for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in patients with an implantable defibrillator or all-cause mortality in patients with an implantable defibrillator or history of ventricular arrhythmias (16732, 65923, 89343, 114186).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral fish oil does not improve glycemic control or prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, oral fish oil may lower triglyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nClinical research shows that taking fish oil may reduce triglyceride levels in patients with diabetes (65577, 65834, 65878, 66027, 66436, 66444, 101538, 101541, 113215). However, although some individual studies disagree, most clinical research shows that taking fish oil has no clinically significant effect on fasting plasma glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes (2299, 2300, 2302, 7368, 7369, 12182, 12925, 13011, 13147, 13149)(65577, 65834, 65878, 66316, 66372, 66426, 66442, 101504, 101541, 101542)(113212). A large, high-quality clinical study also shows that taking fish oil 840 mg daily with or without aspirin for an average of 7.4 years does not decrease the risk for serious vascular complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), when compared with placebo (102401). However, observational research in adults over 60 years of age with diabetes suggests that habitual use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 24% lower risk of dementia over about 7 years when compared with not using fish oil. Consumption of oily or non-oily fish is not associated with dementia risk in individuals with diabetes (113213).\n\nFish oil is also of interest for gestational diabetes. Taking fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (89376, 97174, 110338). Also, taking fish oil does not seem to have beneficial effects on levels of fasting blood glucose during pregnancy in patients with or without any type of diabetes, including gestational diabetes (113211). One clinical trial shows that increased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids following fish oil supplementation during pregnancy are associated with an increased odds of gestational diabetes. However, this association was no longer significant after taking dietary total and saturated fat into consideration (113222). However, a meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking fish oil for 6 weeks during pregnancy modestly improves insulin resistance (113211).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear if enteral fish oil is beneficial in patients with ARDS.\nThe effect of enteral fish oil, with or without borage oil and antioxidants, has been evaluated for improving outcomes in patients with ARDS. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating these ingredients, provided as a specific enteral formula (Oxepa, Abbott Nutrition) or a combination supplement given as a bolus, shows that there is no effect on overall all-cause mortality or ventilator- or ICU-free days when compared with generally isonitrogenous and isocaloric control formulas. A sub-group analysis of lower quality research shows that there may be a modest benefit for patients with a higher risk of mortality (105250). Two more recent meta-analyses have yielded similar results (105248, 105249). Most studies included in these analyses investigated the use of Oxepa and found there was no effect on mortality when compared with control enteral formulas. Studies investigating other sources of enteral or intravenous fish oil were also included in these analyses (105248, 105249). In one of these analyses, some overall low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that use of Oxepa modestly reduces mortality at 28 days, as well as ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (105248). However, these benefits were not found in the second meta-analysis (105249). Most studies included in these analyses used fish oil in combination with other ingredients. Therefore, the effect of fish oil alone is unclear.\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents age-related cognitive decline.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that there is no effect of increased dietary or supplemental omega-3 intake on global cognition in older adults (103501). The effect of fish oil supplements, specifically, is unclear.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if taking oral fish oil during pregnancy prevents allergic rhinitis in the child.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that maternal ingestion of fish oil 4 grams daily, providing 32% EPA and 23% DHA with tocopherol, during late pregnancy might reduce the occurrence of allergic rhinitis in the offspring at 16 years of age when compared with placebo (17409). However, higher-quality clinical research shows that maternal intake of fish oil supplements containing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg by mouth daily starting at 21 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery, does not affect the development of allergic rhinitis in offspring by the age of 3 or 6 years (89361, 97172).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing Alzheimer disease or for improving cognition in those with this condition.\nHigher fish and fish oil intake has been linked to a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer disease in population studies (15040, 15041, 65817). However, in patients with existing mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, taking a specific fish oil supplement (EPAX1050TG, Pronova Biocare A/S) providing the omega-3 fatty acids DHA 1.7 grams and EPA 0.6 grams daily for 6 months does not significantly delay cognitive decline, although this fish oil supplement might slow cognitive decline in a subgroup of patients with very mild cognitive dysfunction (15024). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking fish oil 1 gram (providing docosahexaenoic acid 500 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid 150 mg), lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and vitamin E 15 mg (Memory Health) daily for 12 months does not affect disease severity when compared with placebo. However, there were modest increases the number of patients experiencing either an improvement or an attenuated decline in memory and mood (109764). The effect of fish oil alone is unclear from this study.\nless\nAntiphospholipid syndrome-associated miscarriage. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents miscarriage in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 5.1 grams standardized to a 1.5 ratio of EPA:DHA, daily for 3 years seems to prevent recurrent miscarriage and increase live birth rate in pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (1032).\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for metabolic side effects related to the use of olanzapine.\nIn patients with both schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome using olanzapine, clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Nature Made) providing EPA 720 mg and DHA 480 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by about 27% when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood pressure or levels of fasting glucose or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (105225). In patients taking olanzapine with sodium valproate or lithium, a small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Zahravi Pharmaceutical Company), starting at a dose of 300 mg EPA plus DHA to 600 mg daily in two divided doses and titrating up to 900 mg daily in three divided doses for a total of 6 weeks, does not improve anthropometric measures or lipid parameters when compared with placebo (105226). These differing findings may be due to differences in fish oil dose and duration.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats asthma.\nSome research suggests that fish oil supplements may help TREAT asthma symptoms in some patients, but results are conflicting. Some clinical research shows that taking a fish oil supplement improves peak flow and reduces medication use and cough in children with asthma (12954, 12963). Fish oil providing EPA 17-26.8 mg/kg and DHA 7.3-11.5 mg/kg has been used in one study (12954). However, other clinical research shows that taking fish oil does not improve asthma severity in children with bronchial asthma when compared to control, although asthma severity seems to be reduced when compared to baseline (65497).\n\nIn adults, fish oil does not seem to improve measures of asthma such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak flow rate, asthma symptoms, asthma medication use, or bronchial hyper-reactivity (12954, 17411, 66266, 1036, 20546, 66206). However, in asthmatic patients experiencing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, fish oil (EPAX 3000 TG; Pronova Biocare), 20 capsules totaling 3.2 grams of EPA and 2 grams of DHA daily for 3 weeks seems to improve pulmonary function and reduce bronchodilator use when compared with placebo (65680).\n\nThere is also conflicting evidence for the use of fish oil in asthma PREVENTION. For example, clinical research shows that maternal ingestion of fish oil supplements 4 grams daily or omega-3 fatty acids 0.65-3.7 grams daily during late-phase pregnancy reduces the occurrence of asthma in infants and children by 31% to 63% when compared with control (17409, 66112, 96120). The benefit seems to be greater for children of mothers with the lowest blood levels of EPA and DHA at baseline (96120). Conversely, other research found no benefit for asthma prevention with fish oil supplementation during lactation (66112). Also, giving fish oil containing DHA 280 mg plus EPA 110 mg daily to children during the first 6 months of life does not appear to prevent asthma development by the age of 6-12 months (89338). However, in a meta-analysis of 10 trials with follow-up of 6 months to 24 years, maternal intake of fish oil supplements at a dose of at least 1200 mg daily during pregnancy, lactation, or both, reduces the risk of asthma in the infant, but does not affect the rate of wheezing (108506).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral fish oil improves athletic performance.\nEvidence on the effect of fish oil in athletic performance is mixed. Some clinical research in athletes participating in intensive wrestling training shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 12 weeks improves pulmonary function when compared with placebo (65971). In another small clinical study in professional rugby players, taking fish oil containing EPA 551 mg and DHA 551 mg twice daily for 5 weeks during training attenuates the decline in counter movement jump when compared with placebo (99357). However, taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 weeks does not seem to improve endurance or recovery in professional Australian Football League athletes when compared with baseline or placebo (65876).\nless\nAtopic disease. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the odds of a child developing atopic disease when taken during pregnancy.\nOne clinical trial shows that taking fish oil capsules providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1.9 grams, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0. 22 grams, and other omega-3 fatty acids 0.28 grams, starting in early pregnancy and continuing until 6 months postpartum, does not reduce the odds of the child developing atopic eczema, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, recurrent wheezing, asthma, or food allergy at 12 or 24 months of age when compared with placebo (112465). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in children or adults with ADHD.\nSome, but not all, preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil or other sources of long chain omega-3 fatty acids orally improves attention, cognitive function, and behavior in children aged 8-13 years with or without an official diagnosis of ADHD (8800, 65868). Omega-3 fatty acids 250 mg esterified to phosphatidylserine 300 mg daily for 3 months has been used (65868). Additional clinical research shows that taking a specific supplement containing fish oil 400 mg and evening primrose oil 100 mg (Eye Q, Novasel), six capsules daily for 15 weeks, improves cognitive function, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and behavior in children aged 7-12 years with ADHD (15739). It is unclear if these effects are due to fish oil, evening primrose oil, or the combination. However, research is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies that include some studies mentioned above in children aged 7-12 years old with ADHD shows that taking oral fish oil 51-2513 mg daily with or without stimulants for 4 weeks to 12 months does not improve parent-rated ADHD core symptoms when compared with control. However, subgroup analysis suggests that long-term supplementation with fish oil for 4 months or longer may improve parent-rated ADHD core symptoms when compared with control (112468).\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated in adults with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. One clinical study in this population shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks modestly improves inattention when compared with control (108725).\n\nDespite some positive findings from mainly preliminary clinical research, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses of 120 mg to 1200 mg are not currently recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in children with ADHD. Furthermore, there is not enough research in adults to make a recommendation (110318).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in prevention or treatment of children or adults with autism spectrum disorder.\nClinical research in children with autism shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Zahravi Company) 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, modestly reduces overall autism severity and modestly improves stereotyped behavior and social communication when compared with a control group taking medium chain triglycerides. However, there was no benefit on social interaction (105218). The evidence related to hyperactivity in children with autism is mixed. One small clinical study in children aged 5-17 years shows that taking 1.5 grams of fish oil providing EPA 0.84 grams and DHA 0.7 grams daily for 6 weeks reduces hyperactivity when compared with placebo. However, there was a large between-group difference in baseline hyperactivity ratings, which may have exaggerated the effect size (65732). Other clinical research in children aged 3-8 years shows that taking fish oil 1.3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve hyperactivity when compared with placebo (66070).\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated in adults with autism. One small clinical study shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks improves neurocognition, including attention and working memory, when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect social interaction (108725). Other clinical research in adults with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks modestly improves inattention when compared with control (108725).\n\nOral fish oil has also been evaluated to determine its impact on the likelihood of autism in children. An observational study shows that self-reported prenatal DIETARY fish intake is associated with a 16% lower odds of autism diagnosis, while SUPPLEMENTAL fish oil is not associated with odds of autism diagnosis (115739). The validity of these findings is limited by the possibility of residual confounding and the lack of data on type of fish oil supplementation.\nless\nAutoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for autoimmune thyroiditis prevention.\nThe effect of oral fish oil on autoimmune thyroiditis prevention has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams, alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily, does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable autoimmune thyroiditis when compared with placebo (107184). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as autoimmune thyroiditis was relatively small.\nless\nBipolar disorder. Oral fish oil may be beneficial for symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder. However, taking fish oil does not seem to prevent mood relapses or improve symptoms of mania in these patients.\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses standardized to 1-2 grams eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are weakly recommended for adjunctive use in bipolar depression (110318). This recommendation is based mainly on an early meta-analysis of clinical research of flaxseed oil, EPA alone, or oil containing EPA and DHA (66126). Also, some preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil along with conventional therapies may improve symptoms of depression and increase length of remission when compared with placebo. The doses of fish oil used in these studies provided EPA 6.2 grams and DHA 3.4 grams daily for 4 months or EPA 1.7 grams and DHA 0.9 grams daily for 6 months (7202, 113218). However, a more recent small clinical trial shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA 1 gram plus DHA 1 gram daily for 52 weeks, in a 200 mL smoothie (Nutrifriend, Smartfish) also providing vitamin D 35 micrograms and vitamin E 1.89 mg does not reduce the number of mood episode relapses, increase the time to first mood episode relapse, or improve measures of depression when compared with placebo (105216).\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids have not been shown to be effective in attenuating mania or hypomania. Most research shows that fish oil doesn't seem to have beneficial effects on manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder (5713, 7202, 66126, 105216, 110318). Also, theoretically, fish oil might increase symptoms of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Cases of hypomania have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder using fish oil (5713, 7202).\nless\nBorderline personality disorder. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for borderline personality disorder.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with borderline personality disorder shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids modestly reduces overall symptom severity, especially impulsive behavior, when compared with control. However, one of the studies included in the analysis used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone and another was limited by the lack of a placebo group (106065).\nless\nBurns. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in hospitalized adults with 20-45% surface area 2nd or 3rd degree burns shows that consuming a beverage containing fish oil 3 grams and collagen peptides 40 grams daily for 4 weeks shortens the time to wound healing and improves scar scores but does not limit wound infections when compared with placebo (110667).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary or supplemental fish oil can reduce the risk for cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nThere is conflicting evidence about the role of fish oil in cancer prevention. Many epidemiological studies have found that increased intake of supplemental or dietary fish oil, as well as higher blood levels or dietary intakes of omega-3 fatty acids, are associated with a decreased risk of several cancers including oral, pharyngeal, esophageal, pancreatic, colon, rectal, lung, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers (6395, 7378, 9773, 9774, 10153, 12958, 12959, 12960, 12961, 12962, 15736, 17412)(25937, 101536, 103494, 107175). Also, a meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest fish or fish oil intake is associated with a 13% or 19% reduced incidence of mortality in patients with cancer when compared to the lowest intake (107183). However, most meta-analyses of epidemiological research have identified no benefit (14264, 66078, 66092, 103494) and a large clinical trial shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of invasive cancers (99362). Also, one large epidemiological study has found that dietary intake of fish oil from fatty fish twice a week or more was associated with a 16% increased risk of breast cancer when compared with eating fatty fish less than twice weekly (107175). In addition, a meta-analysis of results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests that higher blood percentages of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are associated with a 2.5-fold higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but not low-grade prostate cancer, when compared with lower blood percentages of DHA (25936).\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing or treating canker sores.\nIn patients with chronic canker sores presenting with 1-3 ulcers at baseline, preliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Zahravi Company) 1000 mg daily, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, for 6 months reduces the size, number, duration, pain, and overall severity of ulcers by 32% to 63%. These changes were significant when compared with placebo. In addition, the ulcer-free period was increased by approximately 45% (105219).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). The effect of fish oil on cardiovascular health is controversial. Oral fish oil in doses of up to 4 grams daily does not seem to be beneficial for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. It is unclear whether dietary fish oil or a higher daily dose is beneficial for prevention of CVD.\nIn 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended that healthy individuals consume 1-2 servings of non-fried fish weekly in place of less healthy sources of protein and fat for primary prevention of CVD. This recommendation was based mainly on evidence from prospective cohort studies showing a modestly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) with higher seafood intake or dietary intake of fish oil (97185). Some population research has also found that increased consumption of dietary fish oil is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, sudden death, and myocardial infarction in people without CVD (2309, 8676, 10006, 12915, 12917, 12977, 65723, 94231). However, a large cohort study from the United Kingdom has found that increased consumption of dietary fish oil is associated with an INCREASED risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in people without CVD compared with non-use of fish oil (114182). Also, clinical research generally shows that taking fish oil has little benefit for the primary prevention of CVD. A large meta-analysis of moderate to high quality clinical research published in 2018 shows that higher intake of fish oil as part of the diet or from supplements has little to no benefit for primary prevention of CVD, including all-cause mortality, CVD or CHD mortality, CVD or CHD events, stroke, or arrhythmias (98231). An additional meta-analysis published in 2020 shows that although fish oil supplementation had a very small protective effect overall against CVD death, there was no benefit on all-cause mortality or on primary prevention of CVD death (104547). Reasons for these conflicting results may relate to the fact that most of the primary prevention studies included in these meta-analyses evaluated fish oil supplements rather than dietary fish oil. Only two studies included in one of the meta-analyses assessed the effects of dietary fish oil, while up to 33 studies assessed the effects of fish oil supplements (98231, 104547). Some newer, large, high-quality clinical studies have also found no benefit with fish oil supplements for this purpose. One high-quality study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for about 5.3 years is not beneficial for primary prevention of CVD (99362). Another large study including 15,480 patients with diabetes and no evidence of CVD at baseline shows that taking fish oil supplements 1 gram daily does not reduce the risk of serious vascular events, such as nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, transient ischemic attack, or vascular death, when compared with placebo over a 7.4-year follow-up period (98232). Also, in patients at high cardiovascular risk, taking a prescription-only fish oil product (Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years does not prevent major adverse cardiovascular events, such as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina, when compared with a corn oil placebo (103491). Based on the cumulative evidence, fish oil SUPPLEMENTS do not appear to be beneficial for primary prevention of CVD. DIETARY fish oil may reduce the risk of CVD, but results are conflicting and any benefit is probably modest at best.\n\nResearch has also evaluated fish oil for prevention of cardiovascular events in people with existing CVD (secondary prevention). An analysis of two secondary prevention trials shows that consuming fatty fish 2-3 times weekly reduces the risk of overall mortality by 30%, but does not reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (7359, 8673). Population research in patients with existing CVD suggests that intake of fish oil supplements is associated with a reduced risk of some cardiovascular events when compared with non-use of fish oil supplements (114182). One population study in patients with at least two cardiometabolic diseases suggests that use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 19% lower risk of CVD-related mortality over 12 years, and a 17% lower risk of overall mortality, when compared with not using fish oil supplements. The additional life expectancy range of 1.4 to 2.3 years was dependent on age and the severity of cardiometabolic morbidity (110333). Another large population study suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a small reduction in transitions from atrial fibrillation to major adverse cardiovascular events or myocardial infarction, and from heart failure to death (114182). However, in clinical research, the effect of fish oil supplements for secondary prevention of CVD is controversial and contradictory. Most older research shows that taking fish oil supplements provides benefit; however, these studies are at high risk for bias (1007, 2307, 8673, 12916, 12917, 13750, 65723, 66495). Additionally, newer research shows that supplemental fish oil does not help with secondary prevention of CVD. A large meta-analysis of moderate to high quality clinical research published in 2018 also shows that higher intake of fish oil, mainly as supplements, has little to no benefit for secondary prevention of CVD, including all-cause mortality, CVD or CHD mortality, CVD or CHD events, stroke, or arrhythmias (98231). In addition, a meta-analysis published in 2020 shows that although fish oil supplementation had a very small protective effect overall against CVD death, there was no benefit on all-cause mortality or on the secondary prevention of CVD death (104547). A large clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years does not significantly reduce cardiovascular events when compared with an olive oil control in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors or atherosclerosis (93576). In patients with a recent myocardial infarction, a smaller clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Lovaza, formerly known as Omacor, GlaxoSmithKline) 4 grams daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event over about 6 years, including death, heart failure hospitalization, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or late coronary artery bypass graft, when compared with placebo. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in having at least one major adverse cardiovascular event in patients with at least a 5% increase in blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids (113220). Multiple other meta-analyses published from 2012 to 2018 also show no benefit of fish oil supplements for cardiovascular risk in patients with existing CVD (17990, 94231, 96116).\n\nSome meta-analyses have combined all studies related to both primary and secondary prevention. A meta-analysis published in 2021 shows that fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of CVD death by 7%, non-fatal myocardial infarction by 13%, CHD events by 9%, and major adverse cardiovascular events by 5%, with no benefit on all-cause mortality or stroke. This analysis also showed that use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone, as investigated in only four of the 38 trials, offered the largest protective effect (107181). Another meta-analysis of a small group of randomized trials analyzing the effectiveness of fish oil for protection against CHD in patients with and without CHD at baseline shows that taking fish oil reduces CHD by 16%. However, there was no effect on angina, sepsis, or death (107185). This analysis is limited by the small number and suboptimal quality of studies, as well as the age of the publications. Since these analyses combine patients with and without CVD at baseline, it is difficult to draw any conclusions related to primary CVD outcomes.\n\nThere has been speculation that patients in more recent studies were more likely to be receiving protective effects from treatment with statins and other drugs, which could reduce the potential benefit of fish oil (17990, 17991). However, two meta-analyses of clinical data shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of major vascular events, regardless of prior or concomitant statin use (96116, 98231).\n\nInterestingly, in 2017 the AHA published a science advisory stating that it is reasonable to supplement with fish oil 1 gram daily for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease. The AHA concluded that the cumulative evidence generally supports that fish oil supplementation reduces cardiovascular death, though not nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, and the benefit of using fish oil for secondary prevention outweighs the treatment risk. However, the AHA noted that most evidence of benefit is based on research published before 2002 (93568). Furthermore, the AHA recommendation was released prior to the publication of the most recent clinical trials and meta-analyses showing no benefit of fish oil for secondary prevention of CVD. Many other guidelines including that of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the European Society of Cardiology, and European Atherosclerosis Society state that fish oil supplements are not significantly beneficial for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events (96116, 97477).\n\nOverall, best evidence to date show that fish oil SUPPLEMENTS, typically taken in doses of 1 gram daily, are not beneficial for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. Additionally, prescription fish oil products in higher doses of 4 grams daily do not seem to be beneficial for primary prevention of CVD. DIETARY fish oil might be beneficial for primary or secondary prevention, but benefits are probably modest at best. Still, people should continue to eat fish and other foods that provide omega-3 fatty acids, as these foods make up part of a healthy diet. In fact, in 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that foods containing EPA and DHA may reduce the risk of CHD. However, the FDA has determined that this claim is based on supportive, rather than conclusive, evidence (102370).\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents the development of cataracts.\nEpidemiological research has found that eating fish three times weekly is associated with a modestly reduced risk of developing cataracts in females. Eating fish three times weekly rather than once monthly is associated with an 11% reduction in developing cataracts (12955).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving chemotherapy.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials with unclear or high risk of bias in patients with breast, colon, lung, or ovarian cancer shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for 3-6 months reduces the odds of developing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by approximately 80% when compared with placebo (106070).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral or dietary fish oil is beneficial in patients with CKD or for CKD prevention.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research in adults with CKD who are receiving hemodialysis shows that taking fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. However, this finding is based on low to very-low quality evidence, and there was no difference identified for risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, adults with CKD who are not receiving hemodialysis do not seem to benefit from fish oil supplementation (102395). Observational research in adults with CKD has found that dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake of 1.93-9.65 grams daily is associated with a 33% reduced risk of mortality when compared with intakes of less than 0.86 gram daily. However, the amount of omega-3 intake from fish oil, specifically, is unknown (107173).\n\nObservational research has also been conducted to examine the association between habitual fish oil supplementation and developing CKD. A large observational study in individuals without prior CKD has found that taking fish oil supplements is associated with a 10% reduced incidence of CKD over the next 10 years when compared with not taking fish oil supplements (110330).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with COPD or for COPD prevention.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Omax3, Cenestra Health) 3 grams daily for 6 months does not improve pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, or endothelial function when compared with placebo in patients with COPD. However, it increased the number of people experiencing improvements in health-related quality of life (104546). Another small clinical trial in patients with COPD shows that taking a specific medical nutrition product (Nutrifriend Cachexia; Smartfish) providing omega-3 fatty acids 2 grams, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 10 mcg, and whey protein 10 grams twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve lung function when compared with an isocaloric placebo based on milk protein and sunflower oil. However, there was a modest increase in fat mass, as well as modest reductions in triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure, and exercise-induced fatigue and dyspnea in those taking the omega-3 fatty acid combination product (107189).\n\nObservational research has also been conducted to examine the association between habitual fish oil supplementation and developing COPD. A large observational study in individuals without prior COPD has found that taking fish oil supplements is associated with a 12% reduced incidence of COPD over the next 9 years when compared with not taking fish oil supplements (110331).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with advanced cirrhosis shows that taking fish oil orally does not seem to improve the severity of renal impairment associated with cirrhosis (1013).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats cognitive impairment.\nSome clinical research suggests that taking 3 fish oil capsules (EPAX 1050TG; EPAX AS) by mouth daily for 12 months may improve memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Each capsule contained 1 gram of fish oil, comprised of DHA 430 mg and EPA 150 mg (89346). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that increased dietary or supplemental omega-3 intake has no preventive effect on cognitive impairment in older adults (103501). The effect of fish oil is unclear.\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated as part of combination therapy. A large clinical study in adults at least 55 years of age with cognitive impairment shows that taking fish oil, containing DHA 1.1 grams and EPA 0.4 grams, and dark chocolate containing 500 mg cocoa flavanols daily for 12 months does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with placebo (111453).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats colorectal cancer.\nFish oil has been evaluated for the PREVENTION of colorectal cancer. A large, high-quality clinical study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for a median of 5.3 years does not reduce the risk for colorectal cancer precursors, including colorectal adenomas and serrated polyps, when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with low omega-3 fatty acid levels at baseline or those with African American heritage might have a reduced risk for colorectal cancer precursors; however, further research is needed to confirm these findings (102400).\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated for the TREATMENT of colorectal cancer. One small clinical trial shows that taking a specific fish oil supplement (Omega-3, Phytomare) 2 grams daily containing 360 mg of EPA and 240 mg of DHA for 9 weeks along with chemotherapy prolongs the time to tumor progression when compared with not receiving a fish oil supplement. However, it does not reduce the number of patients with tumor progression, hospitalizations, deaths, or chemotherapy requirements (91249). Observational research has found that increased dietary or supplemental fish oil intake is not associated with increased survival in stage three colon cancer patients overall. However, it is associated with increased survival in patients with wild-type KRAS tumors (101274). Further research is needed to confirm whether specific patient populations might benefit from fish oil supplementation.\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing contrast induced nephropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor, Abbott Laboratories) 4 grams twice daily on the day before and the day of angiography does not reduce the number of patients with an increase in serum creatinine levels of at least 0.5 mg/dL within 48 hours, or the need for renal replacement therapy, when compared with taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg (107193).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial following CABG surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking supplemental fish oil 4 grams orally, containing EPA 2.04 grams and DHA 1.3 grams, beginning on the first postoperative day and continuing for one year thereafter, seems to decrease the incidence of CABG occlusion following surgery when compared with control (2314).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 2 grams daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces body pain and fatigue and improves appetite when compared with patients not taking omega-3 fatty acids. However, there were no significant differences in olfactory symptoms between groups. All patients were also taking hydroxychloroquine 800 mg daily (107188).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing the risk of Crohn disease or the risk for relapse in patients with Crohn disease who are in remission; the available evidence is conflicting.\nPopulation research has found that habitual intake of fish oil supplements is not associated with a decreased risk of Crohn disease (109303). However, taking fish oil might reduce the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn disease. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific enteric coated fish oil supplement (Purepa, Tillotts Pharma) providing 2.7 grams omega-3 fatty acids daily for 12 months can reduce the relapse rate for patients who are in remission (6257). However, other clinical trials show that taking fish oil 4-5 grams daily does not significantly reduce relapse when compared with placebo (6259, 16734). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that treatment with enteric-coated, time-released omega-3 fatty acid or fish oil capsules containing EPA 1.2-3.3 grams and DHA 0.6-1.8 grams daily for up to one year reduces the relapse rate by 13% when compared to control (66061, 89347). However, this risk reduction was not observed when only high-quality studies were considered. Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for 12-24 months does not reduce relapse rate when compared with control (105224).\nless\nCyclosporine-induced hypertension. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil may prevent or modestly improve symptoms in patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension.\nTaking fish oil 3 grams daily for 3 months orally seems to prevent cyclosporine-induced hypertension following cardiac transplant (66367). There is also some evidence that fish oil 4 grams daily for 6 months can maintain pre-cyclosporine blood pressure in patients taking cyclosporine (1012). A meta-analysis of two small clinical studies shows that fish oil 2-18 grams containing 0.6-5.4 grams of EPA and DHA daily for 1-12 months reduces diastolic blood pressure by 4.5 mmHg in kidney transplant recipients using calcineurin inhibitors, including cyclosporine, when compared with placebo (65770).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (EPA plus DHA) as 1.3% of total caloric intake for up to 8 months improves pulmonary function based on forced expiratory volume and reduces the number of days during which antibiotics are needed when compared to baseline (65553).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral fish oil, as supplements or in the diet, reduces the risk of dementia; the available research is conflicting.\nSome epidemiological research suggests that eating fish at least once weekly or the regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 7% to 57% reduced risk of developing dementia in older adults and elderly individuals (65595, 108507, 108724, 109307, 111452); however, other research has found no correlation between overall dementia risk and the consumption of fish or fish oil (65962, 103501).\n\nSome epidemiological research has examined the association between the regular use of fish oil supplements and the risk of individual types of dementia in large prospective studies. These studies suggest that regular use of fish oil supplements is not associated with the risk of Alzheimer disease (108507, 108724, 109307). Also, a study in over 215,000 older adults suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is not associated with the risk of vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia (108507). However, other studies suggest that regular use of fish oil supplements may be associated with 15% and 57% lower risks of vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia, respectively (108724, 109307).\n\nThe reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. One large epidemiological study suggests that associations between the regular use of fish oil supplements and the risks of all-cause or vascular dementia are stronger in males (109307). Some research suggests that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may alter the association between fish oil intake and dementia risk (65817, 108507, 108724), however, other research disagrees (111452). One large epidemiological study suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 15% lower risk of vascular dementia. However, this study suggests that the risk of vascular dementia is INCREASED by 86% in individuals with two APOE-e4 alleles, whereas the risk is reduced by 19% in those with one APOE-e4 allele and by 22% in those with no APOE-e4 alleles (108724). Further research is needed to confirm the clinical relevance of this potential interaction.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral or dietary fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of depression or in patients with depressive symptoms. There is some evidence that benefits vary depending on the form of fish oil used and the patient population studied.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary intake of fish has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide (10867, 10868, 99368). Also, low omega-3 fatty acid levels in plasma and red blood cells have been associated with depression (10859, 10860). However, clinical research does not show that taking fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of depression. A large clinical trial in adults 50 years or older without depression shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 465 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 375 mg, for a median of 5.3 years results in a small increased risk of depression or symptoms of depression when compared with placebo (107196). Also, one small clinical study in healthy female nurses shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 1200 mg and DHA 600 mg daily for 90 days does not affect measures or depression or prevent a major depressive episode when compared with placebo (105220).\n\nIt is also unclear whether oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms of depression. Results from meta-analyses have been mixed (48282, 66129, 99356, 102391, 104551, 107191, 112032). However, populations included in these analyses have included older adults with or without clinical depression (99356, 112032), mixed populations (48282, 66129, 102391), patients with perinatal depression (104551), patients with mild depression (48282), or patients with major or unipolar depression (107191).\n\nDespite the mixed findings overall, most research suggests that taking fish oil may have a small beneficial effect in patients with clinical depression. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with clinical depression shows that fish oil supplementation has a small to modest beneficial effect on symptoms when compared with placebo (107191). However, it is unknown if these benefits are clinically meaningful since most studies are small and generally low-quality. Also, this analysis combined studies investigating fish oil with studies investigating EPA or DHA alone (107191). Small clinical studies in children and adults with clinical depression support the potential for beneficial effects of fish oil (10871, 65712, 65869). Also, clinical research in postmenopausal females with moderate to severe psychiatric distress shows that fish oil reduces depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (65925). However, a small clinical study in Japanese workers with mild to moderate depression shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 500 mg and EPA 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks in addition to a psychological intervention is no different than the psychological intervention alone (100251). Also, a large clinical trial in patients with depression and coronary heart disease shows that adding fish oil 2 grams daily for 10 weeks, providing 930 mg of EPA and 750 mg of DHA, to sertraline 50 mg daily does not improve depression when compared with sertraline and placebo (17408). Additionally, clinical research in patients with a history of ischemic stroke shows that taking fish oil 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression or other mood-related parameters when compared with placebo (65996). An analysis of a cohort of older adults with subthreshold depression or high-risk factors for depression from the VITAL-DEP trial shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily for 2 years does not reduce the risk of major depressive disorder or improve mood scores when compared with placebo (112032).\n\nMost research in patients with perinatal depression has found no benefit. One small study using fish oil capsules 6 grams daily in divided doses for 6 weeks showed positive outcomes (48198). However, a meta-analysis and individual clinical studies show that taking EPA plus DHA does not help to prevent or improve depression in these patients, and, when used along with supportive psychotherapy, is no more effective than therapy alone (65830, 89353, 104551). Taking fish oil 1.9 grams daily or omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 900-1060 mg and DHA 180-274 mg daily for 6-8 weeks does not improve depression when compared with control (65830, 89353).\n\nThe best dose of fish oil for reduction of depression symptoms is unknown. Doses of omega-3 fatty acids used in clinical trials in adults have included fish oil supplements providing EPA, usually 0.6-4 grams daily, alone or with DHA 0.15-2.4 grams daily for 4-16 weeks. In one study, a specific fish oil product (Isodisnatura) 1.5 grams, containing 1.05 grams ethyl-EPA and 0.15 grams ethyl-DHA, daily for 8 weeks was used. In children 6-12 years of age, fish oil 1 gram daily for 16 weeks has been used (10871, 65712, 65869, 65925, 107191). However, meta-analyses of research related to symptoms of depression in mixed populations suggest that fish oil supplements containing only EPA or at least 60% EPA are effective, whereas other fish oil supplements are not (48282, 66129, 102391). Also, although one subgroup analysis of 9 clinical trials found that taking at least 1.5 grams of fish oil daily reduces depressive symptoms (99356), another meta-analysis found that only fish oil formulations containing no more than 1 gram of EPA demonstrated benefit (102391). Based on these and other findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids providing 1-2 grams EPA are recommended for adjunctive use in patients with major depressive disorder. However, omega-3 fatty acids are not recommended as monotherapy and products containing other doses of EPA are not recommended as adjunctive or monotherapy in these patients (110318).\n\nFish oil is also of interest for improving cognitive function in patients with depression. In patients newly diagnosed with depression, clinical research shows that taking fish oil 8 grams daily for 12 weeks in addition to venlafaxine modestly improves immediate memory, but not other measures of cognitive function, when compared with placebo and venlafaxine. Daily intakes of EPA and DHA were 1440 mg and 960 mg, respectively (113219).\nless\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTaking a combination of fish oil (80%) and evening primrose oil (20%) for 3 months seems to improve reading, spelling, and behavior when given to children aged 5-12 years with DCD. The combination contains EPA 558 mg, DHA 174 mg, gamma-linolenic acid 60 mg, and vitamin E 9.6 mg daily (13748). One study shows that taking fish oil with evening primrose oil does not improve motor skills in children with DCD (13748). However, another very small study shows that taking fish oil in combination with evening primrose oil, thyme oil, and vitamin E (Efalex, Efamol Ltd), for 4 months improves motor skills including manual dexterity, ball skills, and balance in children with dyslexia and DCD (5708). The effect of fish oil when used alone is unclear.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nFish oil has been evaluated for the management of diabetic nephropathy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. One small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy related to type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 4.6 grams daily for one year does not improve albuminuria or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when compared with placebo (66427). In patients with type 2 diabetes, the evidence is mixed. In one study of patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Lovaza) providing EPA 1.86 grams and DHA 1.5 grams daily for one year attenuates the progression of albuminuria, but has no effect on the estimated GFR. In patients not taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, there was no effect on albuminuria. The patients in this study had not all been diagnosed with nephropathy (101537). In another study of patients with diabetic nephropathy taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, taking fish oil (Omacor) 3 grams daily for 12 weeks had no effect on proteinuria when compared with control (101538).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not prevent the development of new onset diabetic neuropathy or reduce the severity of neuropathy in patients with existing signs of disease when compared with placebo (106072). However, 86% of patients did not have neuropathy at baseline.\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\nPopulation research in adults with type 2 diabetes has found that consuming at least 500 mg of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish and seafood daily as part of a Mediterranean diet is associated with a 48% reduced risk of developing sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy when compared with consuming lower amounts (96115). In contrast, preliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not affect the severity of retinopathy when compared with placebo (106072). However, most patients did not have retinopathy at baseline and the study was designed to examine diabetic retinopathy severity as a safety assessment, not as a primary or secondary efficacy endpoint.\nless\nDry eye. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of developing dry eye. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with existing dry eye.\nWhile some preliminary observational research has found that higher dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily from seafood sources, is associated with a reduced risk of dry eye syndrome in females (13770), a large ancillary analysis of the VITAL study, which included over 23,500 adults aged 50 years and older, shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily is not associated with reduced incidence of dry eye disease over a median follow-up of 5.3 years when compared with placebo (108510).\n\nThere is also interest in the use of fish oil supplements for the treatment of dry eye. The American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines published in 2013 state that omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil have been reported to be beneficial for dry eye, but the evidence is insufficient to establish effectiveness (95702). Several studies in patients with mild to moderate dry eye suggest that taking fish oil supplements providing EPA 360-1680 mg plus DHA 240-560 mg orally daily for 30 days to 12 weeks reduces tear osmolarity, increases tear film stability, and improves some symptoms of dry eye such as pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity, when compared with placebo (89342, 91861, 93251, 96114, 101544). Specific commercial fish oil products (Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd; Caruso's Natural Health UltraMAX fish oil; PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits softgels, PRN Physician Recommended Nutraceuticals) have been used (89342, 91861, 96114). However, many of these studies are small, and some used highly restrictive eligibility criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, some of these studies show that taking fish oil does not improve volume of tears produced, damage to the eye, or Meibomian gland dysfunction, which is a leading cause of dry eye (91861, 93251). A larger study in over 500 patients shows that taking fish oil providing EPA 2000 mg plus DHA 1000 mg orally daily for 12 months does not improve symptoms of dry eye when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe dry eye (95701). However, the validity of these results is reduced by the use of other medications during the course of the study.\n\nPreliminary research investigating fish oil in combination with other ingredients also shows conflicting results (17523, 91860). One of these studies used a specific combination product (TheraTears Nutrition, Advanced Nutrition Research) providing EPA 450 mg, DHA 300 mg, and flaxseed oil 1000 mg daily for 90 days (17523).\nless\nDyslexia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with dyslexia.\nIn a small clinical trial, taking fish oil containing DHA acid 480 mg daily for one month orally seems to improve night vision in children aged 5 to 12 years with dyslexia. Dyslexic children who take fish oil seem to develop significantly better darkness adaptation (5708).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of fish oil on lipid levels. Consuming about 250 grams of fish in the DIET twice weekly for 8 weeks has been shown to lower total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, in patients with hyperlipidemia (97186). However, most research shows that taking fish oil SUPPLEMENTS does not improve cholesterol levels and might even increase LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia (2318, 8714, 12182, 66196, 97186, 99358). Oftentimes, increases in LDL cholesterol levels occur when fish oil supplements are taken in higher doses such as 5-20 grams daily; however, doses of fish oil supplements containing as little as 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily have been shown to increase LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia (2318, 12182, 65729, 66224, 66267, 66257, 97186).\n\nDespite its unfavorable effects on LDL cholesterol, fish oil supplements might still be beneficial for patients with dyslipidemia and diabetes. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil supplements can decrease elevated triglyceride levels, decrease secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), increase VLDL apolipoprotein B secretion, and increase levels of HDL cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia (8714, 8807, 12182). Fish oil 4 grams daily for up to 8 weeks has been used (8714, 8807). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that fish oil, 6 grams daily for 3 months taken alone, or fish oil 1 gram daily combined with pravastatin 20 mg, can correct the dyslipidemia associated with renal transplantation (8805, 66454).\n\nSome research has shown that taking fish oil in combination with garlic and plant sterols reduces lipid levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia. However, it is possible that these favorable effects are due to the other ingredients, since garlic and plants sterols have been shown to independently reduce lipid levels (2318, 2319, 97173).\nless\nEndometrial cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces the risk for endometrial cancer.\nSome epidemiological research has found that consuming approximately two servings of fatty fish weekly is associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer. However, other epidemiological research has not found an association between fish consumption and risk of endometrial cancer (8690, 9774). It is unclear if taking fish oil supplements reduces the risk of endometrial cancer.\nless\nEndometriosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with endometriosis.\nClinical research in females aged 12-25 years who had surgery for endometriosis at least 6 weeks prior shows that taking fish oil (NatureMade) 1 gram daily for 6 months has no clinical effect on pain or analgesic use when compared with placebo (101546). It is not known whether taking fish oil helps to reduce pain related to endometriosis prior to surgery.\nless\nEpilepsy. Some clinical research suggests that oral omega-3 fatty acids may modestly reduce seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. However, it is unclear if oral fish oil itself is beneficial in patients with epilepsy.\nTwo meta-analyses of several low- to moderate-quality clinical trials in adults and children with epilepsy (drug-resistant and treatment responsive) show that taking omega-3 fatty acids 300-3000 mg daily, usually as fish oil, for 12 weeks to 1 year modestly reduces seizure frequency when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses show greater benefit with doses less than 2000 mg daily (106067, 116951). Although most studies included in the analysis investigated the combined effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), some studies used purified or semi-purified EPA or DHA. Also, some studies included in the analysis were very small in size (89337, 106067, 116951). Clinical research in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intractable epilepsy who are also taking risperidone 0.5 mg daily shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily for 6 months, decreases monthly seizure frequency to a median of zero, compared with no change in children taking placebo. However, there was no change in seizure severity (107172).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces the severity of exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nSmall clinical studies in untrained healthy adults in the United Kingdom show that taking fish oil orally 1.8-3 grams daily for 4-6 weeks prior to and during physical exercise does not prevent muscle soreness following elbow flexion or knee contractions (8524, 89340). Also, a small clinical study in healthy young females shows that taking fish oil (Vital Atman) 3.2 grams at dinner after a resistance exercise protocol and at lunch over the next three days does not prevent muscle soreness when compared with placebo (106071). Other clinical research in trained males shows that taking fish oil 5 grams, containing EPA 1882 mg and DHA 485 mg, orally daily for 4 weeks does not reduce muscle soreness after eccentric exercises when compared with placebo (111451).\n\nHowever, other small clinical studies in untrained healthy adults in Japan show that taking fish oil 1.8-2.4 grams (containing about 300-600 mg EPA and 200-260 mg DHA) daily for 1-2 months ameliorates muscle soreness and improves range of motion following knee extensor exercises or eccentric contraction exercises (65958, 98257, 100252, 109222). Also, a small clinical study in professional rugby players shows that taking fish oil containing EPA 551 mg and DHA 551 mg twice daily for 5 weeks reduces subjective ratings of whole body muscle soreness when compared with placebo (99357). Another small clinical trial in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking fish oil (PronovaPure 500:200TG, Newtrition, BASF Pharma, Singapore) 4 grams daily for 4 weeks prior to and for 48 hours after a single high-intensity interval training cycling session modestly reduces calf pain, but not pain in the anterior or posterior thigh, compared with placebo (114188). These differing findings might be due to differences in patient populations due to their geographic location, but higher quality research is needed to confirm.\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated as part of combination therapy. Preliminary clinical research in healthy untrained adults shows that taking a specific fish oil product (Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd) containing EPA 4.8 grams and DHA 2.08 grams, and branched-chain amino acid 9.6 grams orally daily for 8 weeks improves muscle soreness scores and range of motion after eccentric exercise when compared with placebo (111461). It is unclear if this effect is due to fish oil, branched-chain amino acid, or the combination.\nless\nFood allergies. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with food allergies.\nA pooled analysis of clinical research shows that maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to egg by 31%, but not to milk or peanuts (97177).\nless\nFrailty. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing frailty.\nPreliminary clinical research in community dwelling adults at least 70 years of age shows that taking fish oil 1 gram orally daily for 3 years does not reduce the odds of becoming pre-frail or frail over 36 months when compared with placebo (110829).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 1.8 grams three times daily for 8 days does not improve severity of gingivitis on days 14, 28, or 35 when compared with placebo (1005).\nless\nGlaucoma. Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for glaucoma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition.\nHemodialysis graft dysfunction. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with hemodialysis graft dysfunction.\nThe evidence on the effects of fish oil for preventing thrombosis or maintaining hemodialysis graft patency is conflicting (8684, 65762, 89348, 96119). However, a meta-analyses of the available clinical research provides moderate evidence that taking fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids 1.6-3.4 grams daily for 3-12 months reduces thrombosis or the need for intervention to restore arteriovenous access by about 19% to 29% when compared with placebo in patients with fistula or grafts due to kidney failure (96123, 98247). Fish oil 4 grams daily for one year has been used to prevent thrombosis after graft placement (8684).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for HIV.\nSome clinical evidence shows that taking fish oil-containing food bars does not improve CD4 counts in patients with HIV (66414). Other clinical research shows that enteral supplementation with a fish oil-enriched peptide-based formula improves CD4 count, but not viral load, in patients with HIV when compared with standard formula (65525).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of conversion from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prediabetes, taking a specific fish oil product (ESAPENTR, Pharmacia and Upjohn) 1 capsule by mouth three times daily (for a total of EPA 1530 mg and DHA 1050 mg) for 6 months lowers triglycerides with no deterioration in glucose tolerance over one year (7368). Although fish oil may prevent worsening of glycemic parameters, it does not seem to improve them. A small clinical trial shows that taking a specific fish oil supplement (EPAX AS) 6 grams containing 3.9 grams of omega-3 fatty acids does not improve glycemic outcomes when compared with placebo in patients with impaired glucose regulation (98242).\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if oral fish oil, taken during pregnancy or by the infant, is beneficial for improving vision or cognitive development in infants.\nPopulation research suggests that increased consumption of seafood during pregnancy is associated with improved measures of infant and child development such as verbal intelligence, communication, and social development (15743). In contrast, supplementation with fish oil during pregnancy and/or lactation does not seem to be beneficial or may only be beneficial in male offspring. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and/or lactation, mainly from fish oil, does not improve cognitive outcomes in the infant up to approximately 2 years of age when compared with control (103495, 105213). This is supported from the findings of most individual clinical trials providing fish oil supplements 1-4 grams daily from 20-21 weeks gestation until delivery or until 30 days after childbirth, or providing fish oil supplements or dietary fish during lactation (15162, 48105, 97182, 99364, 113217). An additional small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 260 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1440 mg, from 22-24 weeks gestation until delivery, does not improve most measures of developmental or behavioral milestones in the infant at 6 months, when compared with olive oil placebo (110354). A large clinical trial shows that ingestion of fish oil (Incromega TG3322, Croda) 4 grams daily during late-phase pregnancy, providing 1.3 grams EPA and 0.9 grams DHA, results in a 17- to 21-day earlier achievement of some, but not all, late motor milestones in male infants. However, there was no improvement in earlier motor milestones. This study also identified modest improvements in male infants for early, but not late, word production, cognitive development at 2.5 years, and behavior and emotion at 6 years (105213).\n\nProviding fish oil supplementation directly to infants may improve the development of vision, but not cognition. Clinical research shows that infants supplemented with fish oil-containing formula beginning within 3-10 days of birth have improved visual acuity at 2 months and improved oscillatory potentials, which are thought to reflect retinal function, at 1 year when compared to infants supplemented with linolenic acid-containing formula (66399, 66569). However, supplementing infants with omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil does not affect cognition and neurodevelopment (89349, 89363).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for insomnia.\nIn a group of healthy female nurses also undergoing a mindfulness-based stress management program or given a psychoeducation leaflet, preliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 1200 mg and DHA 600 mg daily for 90 days modestly reduces insomnia severity when compared with placebo. However, benefits were no longer present after 6 or 12 months (105220).\nless\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for prevention of IUGR, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition.\nJoint pain. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil powder 375 mg in combination with lemon verbena extract (Monteloeder, Ltd) 230 mg six times daily for 5 weeks, followed by three capsules daily for 3 weeks, reduces symptoms of joint pain and stiffness when compared with placebo (17748). It is unclear if these effects are due to fish oil, lemon verbena, or the combination.\nless\nKidney failure. Small clinical studies in patients with kidney failure suggest that oral fish oil may modestly improve some blood lipid and inflammatory marker levels.\nSome clinical research shows that taking fish oil reduces levels of inflammatory markers. A meta-analysis of clinical research and individual preliminary clinical trials in patients on hemodialysis show that taking omega-3 fatty acids, usually as fish oil, reduces C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels when compared with a control oil. Studies have used doses of up to 9 grams daily for 2-12 months (8685, 65959, 107190).\n\nAdditional preliminary clinical research in adults on chronic hemodialysis shows that taking three packets of a specific product (Coromega) containing emulsified fish oil (EPA 350 mg and DHA 230 mg) 650 mg per packet daily for 8 weeks modestly increases hemoglobin, albumin levels, and urine output (8685). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that any benefit on hemoglobin levels is small, that albumin levels are not improved, and that mortality is not reduced (107190).\n\nOral fish oil may also improve some, but not all, blood lipid levels in patients on hemodialysis. A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults undergoing dialysis shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but not total cholesterol levels (107190). Also, in children aged 8-17 years on chronic hemodialysis, preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 2 grams daily for 3 months reduces total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared to baseline. It also seems to improve some inflammatory markers and quality of life (102396, 103596). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 2 grams, containing EPA 160 mg, DHA 100 mg, and d-alpha-tocopherol 0.9 IU, three times daily for 6 months does not reduce lipoprotein(a) levels, when compared with placebo (65997).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing kidney stones.\nA large observational study suggests that habitual use of fish oil by adults with low to moderate genetic risk is associated with a 16% reduced risk of developing kidney stones when compared with non-users of fish oil supplements. However, fish oil use was not associated with kidney stone prevention in adults with high genetic risk (113208).\nless\nKidney transplant-related bone loss. Clinical research suggests that oral fish oil does not improve bone mineral density following a kidney transplant.\nClinical research in adults shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 2.6 grams daily, starting 8 weeks post-kidney transplant and continuing for 44 weeks, does not affect the change in bone mineral density at the hip, spine, or forearm or alter mineral metabolism when compared with olive oil as placebo. The omega-3 supplement used in the study (Omacor, Pronova Biopharma) provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 460 mg/gram capsule and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 380 mg/gram capsule for a total of three capsules daily (107179). A larger study population and duration are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil can improve nutritional status in patients with lung cancer.\nClinical research in patients with lung cancer shows that taking fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1.6 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.8 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly increases body weight, serum albumin, and triglyceride levels, and decreases the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when compared with sunflower oil as placebo. However, there was no effect on body mass index or arm circumference (107194).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition.\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for male infertility.\nObservational research suggests that there is a link between fish oil supplement intake and semen quantity and quality. In men who took fish oil supplements on less than 60 of the last 90 days, semen volume was 0.38 mL higher and testicular size was 0.8 mL larger than those who had taken no fish oil supplements. In men who took fish oil supplements on at least 60 of the past 90 days, semen volume was 0.64 mL higher and testicular size was 1.5 mL larger than those who had taken no fish oil supplements. These findings suggest a dose-dependent effect of fish oil. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the observational nature of the study, the unclear health status of the participants, and the lack of information on clinical fertility outcomes (102394). A meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials in adult males with infertility shows that taking fish oil, containing DHA 400-720 mg and EPA 132-1,112 mg, orally daily for 10-32 weeks improves sperm concentration and sperm motility, but not pregnancy rates, when compared with placebo. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (111459).\nless\nMelanoma. It is unclear if there is a link between fish oil intake and the incidence of melanoma.\nAn analysis of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort study in over 491,000 older adults, has found that total intake of fish is associated with increased melanoma risk over a median follow-up of 15.5 years. When the lowest and highest quintiles of intake are compared, there is a 22% increase in the risk for malignant melanoma and a 28% increase in the risk for melanoma in situ. In sub-group analyses, all melanoma incidence is positively associated with tuna intake or non-fried fish intake, but malignant melanoma incidence is inversely associated with fried fish intake (108509). It was suggested that the positive associations could be due to contaminants in fish such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, arsenic, and mercury.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that fish oil supplements do not affect hot flashes, insomnia, or quality of life during menopause when compared with placebo (99363). However, a larger meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in adults with menopausal symptoms shows that taking fish oil 300 mg-1800 with or without vitamin E 850 mg orally daily for 8-12 weeks modestly improves the intensity, but not frequency, of hot flashes when compared with control (111460).\n\nEvidence from one clinical trial also suggests that fish oil supplements might reduce night sweats (99363). In addition, clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Omega-rex, Daana Pharmaceutical Co.) 1 gram, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, daily for 12 weeks improves overall symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and anxiety, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood lipid levels, urogenital symptoms, joint problems, or feelings of exhaustion (103492).\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with MASLD.\nA meta-analysis of several moderate-quality clinical studies in adults with MASLD shows that taking fish oil for 3-12 months slightly improves levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and reduces triglycerides and waist circumference, when compared with placebo. There were no effects of fish oil supplementation on most other glycemic, lipid, or liver parameters (116624). The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by the lack of dosing regimen disclosure. Also review effectiveness in NAFLD, a similar condition.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if supplemental fish oil is beneficial for reducing the frequency or severity of migraine headaches. However, dietary fish oil may reduce the frequency and duration of migraine headaches.\nMost research shows that taking fish oil supplements providing EPA and DHA orally does not decrease the frequency or severity of migraine headaches in adolescents and adults (8712, 8713, 99361). However, one meta-analysis of two very small clinical trials shows that fish oil supplements might decrease the duration of migraines by an average of 3.4 hours (99361). Also, a clinical trial in patients with episodic migraines shows that taking fish oil 1 gram twice daily, providing EPA as ethyl ester 1.8 grams daily, for 12 weeks reduces the number of migraine days per month by 3.8 and the number of days requiring rescue analgesia per month by 1.2 when compared with placebo. Taking fish oil also improves headache severity, disability, anxiety, and depression. A sub-analysis shows that these beneficial effects are limited to females (114184). The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may be due to the dose, duration, and type of omega-3 fatty acids used. Also, some studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nOne clinical study suggests that increasing dietary intake of fish oil may be beneficial. Increasing dietary intake of EPA plus DHA in the form of fish oil to 1.5 grams daily for 16 weeks, while maintaining dietary intake of linoleic acid at levels no greater than 7% of energy, decreases the frequency and duration of migraines, but does not improve migraine-related quality of life, when compared with intakes of EPA plus DHA of less than 150 mg daily, as is commonly found in the North American diet. Some patients also further reduced dietary linoleic acid intake. In those increasing fish oil intake and maintaining linoleic acid intake, headache duration was reduced by 1.3 hours per day; in the patients who also reduced linoleic acid intake to no more than 1.8% of energy, it was reduced by 1.7 hours per day. The duration of moderate to severe headaches was also reduced and patients had 2-4 fewer headaches each month depending on linoleic acid intake. There was no clear effect on the use of acute pain medication (105289).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving muscle strength in young adults.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in young resistance trained adults undergoing training three times weekly shows that taking fish oil (Nordic Naturals, ProOmega) 4.5 grams daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 2.275 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1.575 grams, for 10 weeks modestly improves upper and lower body strength when compared with taking placebo. There were no differences between groups in lean body mass or fat mass changes (110341).\nless\nObesity. Most clinical research shows that fish oil supplements do not improve weight loss; however, dietary fish intake might be beneficial for obesity. Clinical research also shows that taking fish oil during pregnancy does not seem to prevent overweight or obesity in the infant. It is unclear if fish oil is beneficial for improving cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight or obese children.\nMost research shows that fish oil supplementation does not improve weight loss in obese adults or children (15737, 66004, 89355, 89356, 100247, 100250, 106073). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil supplementation alone or with lifestyle modification does not reduce body weight or body mass index. However, fish oil supplementation seems to modestly reduce waist to hip ratio and waist circumference (97176). The reduction in waist circumference might be due to a decrease in body fat when fish oil is combined with exercise (15737, 89355). A meta-analysis of clinical research in overweight or obese children and adolescents also shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 250 mg to 3360 mg, usually as fish oil, for 3-52 weeks does not reduce body weight or waist circumference when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in body mass index (BMI) of approximately 1 kg/m2. Taking fish oil does not seem to improve most cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, although there were modest improvements in serum triglyceride levels and systolic blood pressure (106073). This analysis is limited by the inclusion of at least one study that investigated the use of an algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) product.\n\nResearch has also investigated the effect of fish oil supplementation on the prevention of overweight or obesity in the infant or young child when taken during pregnancy by females with overweight or obesity. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil 6 grams daily from mid-pregnancy until 3 months postpartum or when breastfeeding stopped, providing a total of 3.55 grams daily omega-3 fatty acids, does not affect infant body fat percentage or most measures of body anthropometry at 2 weeks or 3 months of age when compared with olive oil placebo. However, there was a slight increase in body mass index for age at 3 months, possibly related to increased fat mass (110338). Another clinical trial shows that taking two capsules daily of fish oil (Croda Europe Ltd.) during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.22 grams and DHA 1.9 grams daily, does not prevent overweight in the child at 24 months when compared with taking placebo. The odds of overweight at 24 months were reduced by approximately 78% in children of those taking fish oil along with 10 billion colony forming units each of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420; however, this reduction was similar to findings related to taking the probiotics alone in the absence of fish oil (110336).\n\nIn contrast to fish oil supplements, dietary fish might enhance weight loss. Some evidence shows that dietary fish intake improves weight loss and decreases blood glucose and insulin concentrations in overweight and hypertensive patients when combined with a calorie-restricted diet (2049).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for oral mucositis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with chemotherapy-induced mucositis shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg containing 360 mg EPA and 240 mg of DHA daily for 21 days reduces mucositis severity and pain when compared with placebo (98246).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral fish oil has predominantly been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nEpidemiological research has found that increasing intake of foods including fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids while decreasing intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip in both males and females (12956, 65895). Clinical research shows that taking fish oil orally, in combination with evening primrose oil and calcium, for 18 months seems to decrease bone turnover and increase spinal and femoral BMD in elderly people with osteoporosis (7611, 12925). 2000 mg of a mixture of evening primrose and fish oil (containing 60% Iinoleic acid, 8% gamma-Iinolenic acid, 4% EPA and 3% DHA), taken three times daily with meals along with calcium carbonate 600 mg has been used (7611). However, taking fish oil containing 0.45 or 4.5 grams EPA plus DHA daily for 2 years does not improve BMD in middle-aged to elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis who do not have osteoporosis (96122).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of Parkinson disease.\nA large observational study suggests that habitual use of fish oil is associated with an 11% reduced risk of developing Parkinson disease when compared with non-users of fish oil supplements (113214). Also, preliminary observational research suggests that initiating supplemental fish oil is associated with a reduction in Parkinson symptoms (110343). However, this study is limited by its retrospective design and the lack of symptom specific information.\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for periodontitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in individuals with chronic mild or moderate periodontitis treated with scaling and planing shows that taking fish oil providing 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA daily for one or three months modestly reduces pocket depth and improves clinical attachment, when compared with taking a placebo or no fish oil (101545, 110347). Other clinical research in patients with periodontitis also receiving scaling and planing shows that taking high-dose fish oil, containing EPA 2.6 grams, 1.8 grams DHA, and other ingredients, orally once daily for 6 months improves bleeding and plaque scores, but not pocket depth, when compared with no intervention (111456). It is unclear if this effect is due to fish oil, other ingredients, or the combination. One study shows that pocket depth is reduced by 21%, compared with 5% in those taking no fish oil; however there were no benefits on gingivitis or plaque (101545). Benefits seem to be maintained up to 3 months post-treatment (101545).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for PAD.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally appears to have no effect on walking distance in patients with stable claudication (1002).\nless\nPhenylketonuria (PKU). Small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil may modestly improve symptoms in patients with PKU.\nSome small clinical trials show that taking fish oil supplements (Ameu, Omega Pharma) containing DHA 15 mg/kg daily for 3 months improves motor skills, coordination, and visual function in children with PKU when compared to control. However, it does not affect plasma levels of phenylalanine (65771, 65981).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for pneumonia.\nEpidemiological research found no relationship between fish consumption and the risk of developing community-acquired pneumonia (13760).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Most small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil is not beneficial for weight loss or glucose homeostasis in patients with PCOS.\nSmall clinical trials in patients with PCOS show that taking fish oil alone or with vitamin D3 does not affect body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo or control oils (21906, 107187, 107197). Also, taking fish oil does not seem to affect most measures of glucose homeostasis or blood lipids when compared to control oils (21906, 107197). However, when used in combination with vitamin D3, taking fish oil modestly reduces levels of testosterone and results in some overall improvement in feelings of depression and anxiety (107187). Doses used in clinical trials have included fish oil (Nordic Naturals) providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 2148 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1452 mg daily for 6 weeks, or fish oil 2 grams daily plus vitamin D3 50,000 IU biweekly for 12 weeks (21906, 107187, 107197).\nless\nPolymyalgia rheumatica. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for polymyalgia rheumatica prevention.\nOral fish oil for the prevention of polymyalgia rheumatica has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.46 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.38 grams alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable polymyalgia rheumatica when compared with placebo (107184). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as polymyalgia rheumatica was relatively small.\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. Most research shows that oral fish oil is beneficial for improving triglyceride levels after menopause. More research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration.\nLipid metabolism is often altered after menopause. A meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in postmenopausal females shows that taking fish oil supplements for a period of 2 weeks to 24 months decreases triglyceride levels by an average of 17.8 mg/dL when compared to placebo. The greatest evidence of benefit occurred in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m2 or with baseline hypertriglyceridemia. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, were modestly increased. The dose of fish oil used in the individual clinical trials ranged between 285 mg and 14 grams daily, with the most evidence of benefit associated with doses of at least one gram daily (110351).\nless\nPostoperative fistula. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, reduces the risk of a mucocutaneous fistula diagnosis to 8%, compared with 23% of those given a hospital-prepared blended diet (107178).\nless\nPostoperative infection. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, does not reduce the risk of a wound infection or general infection when compared with a hospital-prepared blended diet (107178).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, reduces hospital length of stay by 5 days when compared with a hospital-prepared blended diet. Also, body weight was modestly higher at treatment completion in those taking the fish oil product (107178).\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for postpartum depression.\nMeta-analyses of available research show that taking fish oil, usually during pregnancy, has no effect on the prevention or treatment of perinatal depression when compared with placebo. In addition, when used along with supportive psychotherapy, fish oil is no more effective than therapy alone for perinatal depression (103493, 104551). However, a meta-analysis of a small number of studies shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids might have a moderate effect on the prevention of postpartum depression (103493). The studies included in this analysis were heterogeneous. Most studies used fish oil providing EPA up to 2200 mg daily and DHA up to 1638 mg daily, but some studies in the analysis used DHA alone from algal sources (103493).\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for PTSD.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that adding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation to psychoeducation does not further improve symptoms of PTSD in subjects that were part of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team after the Great East Japan Earthquake (89358). Additional preliminary clinical research in patients in intensive care shows that use of fish oil 18.8 grams per liter of enteral feed is no more effective than enteral feeding without fish oil in preventing symptoms of PTSD from developing up to 6 months later (104549).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving the development of premature infants.\nFormula supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil and borage oil daily for up to 18 months seems to improve growth and neurodevelopment in preterm infants, especially boys (13745).\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if enteral or topical fish oil is beneficial in patients with pressure ulcers.\nPreliminary clinical research in critically ill, hospitalized adults shows that giving enteral or parenteral formula supplemented with fish oil containing EPA 0.125-0.282 grams and DHA 0.144-0.309 grams per 100 mL for 28 days may slow the progression of grade II or higher pressure ulcers when compared with standard formula (89370). In patients with acute lung injury, other preliminary clinical research shows that giving a specific enteral emulsion (Oxepa, Ross Laboratories) providing fish oil, borage oil, and vitamins A, C and E for 7 days does not improve the healing of existing pressure ulcers when compared with a control enteral formula. Although the number of pressure ulcers in the group given the GLA-containing formula was lower when compared with the control formula, these patients also seemed to have fewer pressure ulcers at baseline and no statistical comparison was conducted. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown (105252).\n\nTopical fish oil has also been evaluated. One small clinical study shows that applying fish oil dressing once daily to the heels of immobile intensive care unit patients for 7 days does not reduce the risk for heel pressure ulcers when compared with olive oil dressing (102392). However, other clinical research in patients in the ICU shows that applying fish oil by hand to the sacrum for 30 seconds daily for up to 6 days modestly reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers when compared with soybean oil or routine care only. However, applying fish oil reduces the risk of pressure ulcers when compared with routine care, not when compared with soybean oil (110344).\nless\nPreterm labor. Research on the use of oral fish oil for the prevention of preterm labor is conflicting; however, there may be benefit of oral fish oil in patients with low baseline omega-3 status.\nPopulation research has found that eating seafood during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery when compared with never eating fish (65528). Clinical research also shows that taking a specific omega-3 fatty acids supplement (Pikasol) 2.7 to 6.1 grams, containing DHA 0.9 to 2.1 grams and EPA 1.3 to 2.9 grams, daily beginning at 20-33 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of premature delivery (8706, 12972, 66105). Meta-analyses of these and other studies show that taking omega-3 fatty acids, including fish oil and supplements or foods enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), during pregnancy reduces the risk of early preterm delivery (gestational age less than 34 weeks) by 22% to 27% and may reduce the risk of preterm delivery (gestational age less than 37 weeks) by 10% to 11% when compared to control (98240, 106069).\n\nHowever, conflicting evidence exists. The most recent meta-analysis shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of early preterm or preterm delivery when compared to control when only studies with low risk of bias were analyzed (106069). Numerous individual studies support this finding (66020, 98255, 101505, 101540, 102397, 103496, 110338). Some individual studies included in the meta-analysis have used a specific fish oil supplement (Incromega DHA 500TG) 900 mg containing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg daily, starting at 20 weeks' gestation and continuing to delivery or 34 weeks' gestation (101505) or fish oil 2 grams daily, containing EPA 660 mg and DHA 440 mg, starting mid-gestation and continuing until the last day of the 37th week of gestation (102397). Other clinical trials not included in the meta-analysis also show that perinatal fish oil does not prevent preterm labor when compared with placebo. These studies have used fish oil 1000 mg containing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily, starting at week 20 of gestation and continuing until birth (98255) or fish oil (Incromega TG33/22) 4 grams daily, providing 2.4 grams long chain omega-3 fatty acids, starting at about 24 weeks' gestation (101540). However, in this study, birth weight was increased by about 97 grams and gestation was increased by approximately 2 days when compared with olive oil placebo (101540). In one clinical trial, use of a high-DHA fish oil, providing EPA 100 mg and DHA 800 mg daily, from before 20 weeks' until 34 weeks' gestation, increases the risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks' gestation when compared with placebo in patients with baseline omega-3 status of greater than 4.9%. However, the risk is reduced from 3.2% to 0.7% in patients with baseline omega-3 status below 4.1%. In addition, taking fish oil had no effect on the risk of preterm birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation (103496). Other subgroup analyses also suggest that fish oil may be more effective in patients with low baseline omega-3 levels and singleton pregnancy (111457).\n\nThe reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may be due to the dose, duration, and type of omega-3 fatty acids used, or the baseline omega-3 status (102397, 103496).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing a prostatectomy.\nClinical research in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking fish oil 3.75 grams (75% EPA and 10% DHA) daily, for approximately 14 months starting 7 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy, does not improve most prostate cancer-specific quality of life measures when compared with placebo. However, urinary function was improved 12 months after surgery (110353).\nless\nPruritus. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with pruritus.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in adults with pruritus while under palliative care shows that taking fish oil 2-6 grams for 20 days to 14 weeks significantly improves pruritus scores when compared with placebo (111455).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral or topical fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of psoriasis. Intravenous fish oil seems to reduce symptoms in patients with acute, extended guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis.\nDespite some promising, low-quality studies, taking fish oil orally doesn't seem to have a significant effect on psoriasis severity (1035, 8708, 66585, 66157, 66233, 102393). However, when administered in combination with sub-erythemal ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy, oral fish oil therapy providing EPA 3.6 grams and DHA 2.4 grams daily for 15 weeks seems to decrease the total body surface area of psoriasis when compared with placebo (66220).\n\nTopical fish oil has also been evaluated. Applying fish oil under an occlusive dressing for 6 hours daily for 4 weeks seems to improve scaling, but not erythema, in patients with psoriasis when compared with liquid paraffin (65575).\n\nThe effect of oral fish oil on psoriasis prevention has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable psoriasis when compared with placebo (107184). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as psoriasis was relatively small.\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally containing EPA 3.96 grams and DHA 2.64 grams daily for 12 weeks can improve tolerance to cold and delay the onset of vasospasm in people with primary Raynaud syndrome; however, people with Raynaud syndrome caused by progressive systemic sclerosis don't seem to respond to fish oil supplements (7573).\nless\nSalicylate intolerance. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with salicylate intolerance.\nA case series including three patients suggests that taking fish oil 10 grams daily in divided doses for 6-8 weeks might improve symptoms of salicylate intolerance (17410). High-quality, prospective research is needed to confirm this finding.\nless\nSarcopenia. There is conflicting evidence as to whether oral fish oil improves muscle strength in adults with sarcopenia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids improves lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass, and quadriceps function in older adults. Although most studies used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a few studies used EPA alone and others used alpha-linolenic acid (107195). A network meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with sarcopenia or at risk for sarcopenia shows that taking omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at doses above 2.5 grams daily for 6-156 weeks improves upper-extremity muscle strength and lower-extremity physical function when compared with control or standard care. However, there was no improvement seen in skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, or overall body weight when compared with placebo or standard care. Subgroup analysis suggests that these effects endured even in the absence of concurrent resistance training programs (112470).\n\nSmall clinical trials in older adults involving fish oil and increased dietary omega-3 intake show that fish oil, when used alone or in combination with a resistance exercise program, may have a small effect on some measures of muscle strength and the timed up-and-go test (89368, 105222, 109309, 110335). However, one large study included in the most recent meta-analysis (107195) shows that fish oil is not beneficial for improving muscle strength in older adults. This large, high-quality clinical study in over 1,600 elderly adults shows that taking fish oil, providing DHA 800 mg and EPA 225 mg daily for 3 years, with or without physical activity and counselling, does not improve chair stand test performance or handgrip strength when compared with placebo and lifestyle interventions (102398). Also, an additional small clinical trial in older healthy adults shows that taking fish oil 3 grams daily for 18 weeks in addition to resistance training does not affect strength or functional ability when compared with resistance training plus placebo (98244).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of fish oil in patients following a single episode of psychosis. A preliminary clinical study shows that taking fish oil containing 2.2 grams of EPA and DHA daily for 26 weeks modestly reduces negative and positive symptoms and improves functioning when compared with olive oil placebo. All patients were stabilized on antipsychotic medications (97183). However, conflicting evidence exists. One small clinical study shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg, EPA 1000 mg, and DHA 500 mg twice daily does not prevent 2-year cumulative relapse or delay relapse when compared with placebo in patients who responded well to antipsychotic treatment after a single episode of psychosis (90675). A meta-analysis of these two studies shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces negative and positive symptoms and improves functioning when compared with placebo (105217).\n\nA small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 360 mg and EPA 540 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve most symptoms of schizophrenia, although it may modestly reduce aggression when compared with placebo (98256). Due to the general lack of supporting evidence related to the use of omega-3 fatty acids for schizophrenia, the Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses of 1-2 grams are not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in these patients (110318).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with sepsis.\nMeta-analyses of generally low-quality clinical trials show that parenteral or enteral supplementation with lipid emulsions containing refined fish oil or other omega-3 fatty acids reduces the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital by about 4 and 10 days, respectively, and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation by about 2 days when compared with placebo or no supplementation in patients with sepsis (98253, 105221, 109305). Also, although an earlier meta-analysis disagrees (98253), most meta-analyses show that use of fish oil-containing nutrition supplementation reduces mortality by up to 26% (105221, 109305). This discrepancy may be related to the form of the lipid emulsion. One sub-analysis shows no beneficial effect from enteral supplementation with lipid emulsions containing fish oil. Only parenteral supplementation reduces mortality by 32% (109305). However, clinical research in patients with sepsis shows that supplementing with lipid emulsions containing refined fish oil does not prevent brain injury or delirium when compared with control (89323).\nless\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking menhaden fish oil 0.25 grams/kg containing 12% EPA and 18% DHA daily for one year reduces the frequency of severe pain episodes when compared with olive oil in patients with sickle cell disease (65510).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with Sjogren syndrome.\nA single-center clinical study in adults with Sjogren syndrome shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg daily for 2 months modestly reduces patient-reported symptoms of dry eye and dry mouth, but not tear production, when compared with placebo. Specific dry eye improvements included reduced itching, mucous discharge, and light sensitivity. All patients also received standard care including hydroxychloroquine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (116950).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in the secondary prevention of stroke or for improving recovery from a stroke. Oral supplemental fish oil does not seem to be beneficial in the primary prevention of stroke.\nTaking a fish oil SUPPLEMENT does not seem to be beneficial for primary prevention of stroke. Clinical research shows that taking a fish oil supplement 1 gram or 4 grams daily does not reduce the risk of stroke (2307, 66185, 103491). In 2017, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a science advisory stating that fish oil supplements should not be used for primary prevention of stroke in patients at high risk for CVD, as the cumulative evidence shows no benefit (93568). Furthermore, a 2018 meta-analysis including 24 studies and over 79,000 patients with or without CVD confirms that taking fish oil SUPPLEMENTS does not reduce the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (98231).\n\nThe effect of DIETARY fish oil for the primary prevention of stroke is controversial. Higher serum levels of fish oil have been associated with a decreased risk of stroke (7372). Early research found that consuming fish oil from dietary sources at least once weekly is associated with a 27% reduced risk of ischemic stroke (7373). However, the method of preparing fish may be important. Eating tuna or other broiled or baked fish has been associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke, while fried fish or fish sandwiches has been associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in elderly people (12923). There has also been some concern that consumption of very high amounts of fish oil from dietary sources might increase the risk of stroke. People who eat more than 46 grams daily of fish appear to be nearly twice as likely to have an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (7603, 7610, 8699); however, these findings are questionable due to poor study design. In 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) issued a science advisory recommending that patients consume 1-2 weekly servings of non-fried fish in place of less healthy protein options for the primary prevention of ischemic stroke (97185).\n\nHowever, dietary intake of fish oil may not be beneficial for stroke prevention in all patients. A 2018 meta-analysis including 4 studies and over 10,000 patients shows that increased dietary fish oil intake does not reduce the risk of stroke (98231). The majority of the studies included in this meta-analysis evaluated only patients with existing CVD. Therefore, it is possible that increased dietary intake of fish oil may not be beneficial in patients with a history of CVD.\n\nThere is currently not enough reliable information available to know if increased intake of fish oil, either as part of the diet or as a supplement, has any benefit for stroke prevention in people who have already had a stroke (secondary prevention).\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated for the improvement of symptoms in patients who are post-stroke. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that due to the heterogeneity and low quality of the available clinical research, it is unclear if fish oil supplements are beneficial for stroke recovery, including mood, mobility, and performance on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, or for the prevention of vascular-related death when compared with placebo or control (102399). One clinical study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, starting before the stroke and continuing for a total median duration of 5.3 years, does not improve functional limitations or physical disabilities over a median 1.4 years after the first stroke (104550). However, the data was heterogeneous in this study and it is unclear what effects, if any, post-stroke supplementation of fish oil might have on these outcomes.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of SLE.\nA meta-analysis of 5 low-quality randomized controlled trials shows that taking fish oil for 12-26 weeks modestly reduces SLE symptoms (104548). However, results from individual studies are mixed (7571, 7572, 12925, 12953, 104548). A specific fish oil supplement (MaxEPA) 3-20 grams daily, alone or along with copper 3 mg daily, has been used in some studies for 24-34 weeks (7572, 12953). The relationship between fish oil use and the development of SLE has also been investigated. However, a large population study from the United Kingdom suggests no association between fish oil use and the risk of SLE (114183).\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in the prevention of tinnitus.\nAn observational study in adults without tinnitus suggests that consuming DIETARY fish, including tuna fish, light-meat fish, or shellfish, once weekly is associated with a 13% reduced risk of persistent tinnitus, with more frequent consumption associated with a greater risk reduction. In contrast, taking SUPPLEMENTAL fish oil is associated with an increased risk of persistent tinnitus by approximately 12% (115738). The validity of these results is limited by the possibility of residual confounding, infrequent data collection on dietary intake, and the lack of data on the type of fish oil supplement used.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nSome clinical research shows that taking fish oil (HiEPA) providing 4.5 grams of EPA daily for 12 months can reduce corticosteroid requirements in adults with ulcerative colitis. However, fish oil does not seem to reduce relapse rates in these patients (1040). Other clinical research shows that taking fish oil 4.2 grams daily for 8 months reduces the symptoms of ulcerative colitis when compared with placebo (65620). However, another clinical study shows that a specific commercial fish oil supplement (MaxEPA, Seven Seas Ltd) does not reduce symptoms such as disease relapse, stool frequency, rectal bleeding, or rectal histology when compared with placebo (1037). Overall, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the relapse rate of ulcerative colitis when compared with control (65786, 105224). Although population research has found that habitual intake of fish oil supplements is associated with a modestly reduced risk of ulcerative colitis (109303), a meta-analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for about 1 year does not reduce the likelihood of an ulcerative colitis diagnosis when compared with a control group receiving monounsaturated fats (105224).\n\nFish oil has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial shows that taking a supplement containing fish oil in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, and vitamin C might reduce corticosteroid requirements in patients with ulcerative colitis; however, it doesn't seem to reduce disease activity or improve histology when compared with placebo (13757).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for URTI prevention or treatment.\nOne small clinical trial in healthy athletes shows that consuming a drink fortified with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 550 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 550 mg, vitamin D3 10 mcg, and whey protein 8 grams twice daily for 16 weeks does not reduce the incidence or duration of URTIs when compared with placebo (98243). However, a large clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Incromega) 2.4 grams daily, providing 55% EPA and 37% DHA, starting at gestational week 24 and continuing until one week after birth, reduces the risk of developing croup by 38% in the offspring aged up to 3 years when compared with olive oil as placebo. This risk reduction remained after adjusting for the use of vitamin D 2800 IU daily, as well as for concomitant persistent wheeze and/or lower respiratory tract infections (109304).\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if dietary fish or omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial in VTE prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest fish consumption is not associated with risk of VTE when compared with the lowest. However, overall intake of omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a small reduction in risk of VTE, as well as a modest reduction in risk of recurrent VTE (105223).\nless\nVitamin D deficiency. It is unclear if fish oil is beneficial for vitamin D deficiency.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements for at least 8 weeks modestly increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels by an average of 3.8 ng/mL. A sub-group analysis shows that this benefit is limited to patients with vitamin D deficiency (105215).\nless\nHeart transplant. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients after a heart transplant.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally seems to preserve renal function and reduce the long-term continuous rise in blood pressure after heart transplantation. There is evidence that a dose of 4 grams of fish oil composed of 46.5% EPA and 37.8% DHA, taken daily for one year after heart transplantation, prevents changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine when compared with placebo (8687).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate fish oil for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nFish oil has most often been used in doses of up to 6 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Lower doses have been used for longer durations. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nFish oil is often standardized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at a median combined total dose of 600 mg daily, providing an EPA median dose of 340 mg daily and a DHA median dose of 270 mg daily or 55% EPA and 37% DHA (12982, 66177, 96120, 101548, 112466).\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nFish oil is commonly standardized to EPA and DHA content. Some formulations of fish oil used in clinical research include: Omacor, now known as Lovaza, which contains EPA 465 mg, DHA 375 mg, and vitamin E 4 mg per capsule (12982, 66177, 101548); MaxEPA, which contains EPA 180 mg plus DHA 120 mg per capsule (66177); Omega Rx, which contains EPA 400 mg, DHA 200 mg, and vitamin E 100 mg per capsule (66177); and Incromega TG33/22 which is 55% EPA and 37% DHA (96120, 109304).\n\nFish oil supplements often contain small amounts of vitamin E as an antioxidant to prevent spoilage. They might also be combined with calcium, iron, or vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C, or D.\n\nFish that are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include mackerel, tuna, salmon, sturgeon, mullet, bluefish, anchovy, sardines, herring, trout, and menhaden (10007). The specific omega-3 fatty acid content of fish in a 3 ounce serving is as follows:\n\nCatfish = 0.15-2 grams\nCod = 0.13-0.24 grams\nFlounder/Sole = 0.42 grams\nHalibut = 0.4-1 grams\nHerring = 1.71-1.81 grams\nMackerel = 0.34-1.57 grams\nRainbow trout = 0.84-0.98 grams\nSalmon (Atlantic, Farmed) = 1.09 - 1.83 grams\nSalmon (Atlantic, Wild) = 0.9 - 1.56 grams\nSalmon (Chinook) = 1.48 grams\nSalmon (pink) = 1.09 grams\nSalmon (sockeye) = 0.68 grams\nSardines = 0.98-1.70 grams\nTuna (light, canned) = 0.26 grams",

However, evidence is conflicting.\nWhile fish oil may not be a potent inhibitor of platelet function, high doses of fish oil might have antiplatelet effects. Theoretically, concomitant use of fish oil with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs may increase the risk of bleeding (8671, 8679, 8696, 13769, 21223, 21224, 66258). However, the most rigorous research shows that short-term doses of fish oil 10 grams daily or long-term doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 52 weeks does not increase the risk of bleeding or affect coagulation parameters in chronically ill and vulnerable patients (97180). Other controlled research shows that fish oil does not affect platelet function or increase the risk of bleeding (17990, 17996, 66105, 66267, 89374, 107180). Some research even suggests that perioperative fish oil use decreases bleeding risk (89352). Some research suggests fish oil does not have additive antiplatelet effects when combined with aspirin (13769), but other clinical evidence suggests that adding fish oil to low-dose aspirin treatment increases antiplatelet effects in patients who are aspirin-resistant (21226). Also, some clinical research seems to show that fish oil has additive antiplatelet effects when used with aspirin and clopidogrel compared to aspirin and clopidogrel alone (21225).\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking fish oil with antihypertensive drugs might increase the risk of hypotension.\nClinical evidence indicates that fish oils can modestly lower blood pressure and might have additive effects in patients treated with antihypertensives (1001, 1020, 1030, 1033, 66095, 66100, 66215, 66331, 66358, 66379, 66385).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, taking fish oil with contraceptive drugs might decrease the triglyceride-lowering effects of fish oil.\nThere is some evidence that contraceptive drugs might interfere with the triglyceride lowering effects of fish oils (8694).\nless\nCYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTaking fish oil with cyclosporine might increase levels and adverse effects of cyclosporine.\nIn kidney transplant recipients on a general immunosuppressive regimen, taking omega-3 fatty acids daily seems to increase peak blood levels of cyclosporine when compared with placebo.

To avoid this potential interaction, recommend separating administration of orlistat and fish oil by at least 2 hours.\nless\nPLATINUM AGENTS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, taking fish oil with platinum agents can cause resistance to platinum agents, potentially decreasing their effectiveness.\nPlatinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs) are fatty acids secreted from human and mouse stem cells when exposed to platinum-based chemotherapy. Animal research suggests that PIFAs cause resistance to chemotherapy by stimulating lysophospholipid production in the spleen, which interferes with the DNA damage caused by certain chemotherapy drugs (92076). One PIFA, known as 16:4(n-3), has been found in both raw fish and some commercially available fish oil products. Mackerel and herring have high PIFA concentrations, while salmon and tuna have low PIFA concentrations. Levels of PIFA in commercial fish oil products ranged from 0.2- 5.7 microMol. Animal research shows that PIFA-containing fish oil products cause resistance to cisplatin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (91250, 92075). It is unclear if all commercially available fish oil products contain PIFAs. Additionally, it is argued that levels of PIFA found in some fish oil products are too low to be of clinical concern. Furthermore, a lack of chemotherapy resistance in countries with high fish intake, such as Greenland, Japan, and Norway, suggest that this interaction may not be clinically significant (91288, 91289).\nless\nSIROLIMUS (Rapamune)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Case-control study)\nTaking fish oil with sirolimus might increase levels and adverse effects of sirolimus.\nPharmacokinetic research shows that omega-3 fatty acids increase exposure to sirolimus in kidney transplant patients on a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive regimen. A 25% dose reduction in sirolimus was required to keep patients within the expected trough-concentration window (105232). Researchers hypothesize that this may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by fish oil, although this has not been confirmed in clinical research.\nless\nTACROLIMUS (Prograf)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTaking fish oil with tacrolimus might increase levels and adverse effects of tacrolimus.\nIn a small group of patients, taking fish oil 2.6 grams (Omacor) daily for 4 weeks increased the 8-hour area under the curve of tacrolimus by 25% when compared with baseline. Peak levels were increased by approximately 22% (105212).

Increased risk of bleeding associated with a lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) has been reported in patients with cirrhosis using fish oil (1013).\nless\nDIABETES\nTheoretically, high doses of fish oil might worsen glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Until more is known, use with caution. Some studies have found modestly increased fasting blood glucose in type 2 diabetes patients who take fish oil (10007, 13146). Higher doses seem more likely to increase fasting blood glucose. Although fish oil has been shown to adversely affect levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (107192), meta-analyses of several fish oil studies suggests that fish oil doses from 2-18 grams daily do not seem to adversely affect long-term glycemic control or HbA1C in patients with type 2 diabetes (2299, 7368, 7369, 12182, 13011, 13013, 101541).\nless\nFAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS\nTheoretically, fish oil might further increase the risk of cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Until more is known, use with caution.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with fish oil.\n\nHowever, fish oil might contain potentially harmful contaminants that can be found in some species of fish (65692). There is some concern that fish or fish oil products might be contaminated with toxins or pesticides if the fish were caught in contaminated waters (6875). Heavy metals, especially mercury, are a particular concern (259).\nMethylmercury: Consuming contaminated fish can result in accumulation of methylmercury and toxicity. High levels of methylmercury can cause symptoms such as tremor, numbness and tingling, difficulty concentrating, and vision problems. Methylmercury toxicity is most dangerous in very young children and those who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant. High methylmercury levels can cause brain damage, mental retardation, blindness and seizures. Lower levels can cause more subtle problems such as learning disabilities (12964). Methylmercury exposure has been associated with heart disease, particularly myocardial infarction. Some research suggests that methylmercury might antagonize the beneficial cardiovascular effects of omega-3s and have pro-oxidant effects (12973). An analysis suggests that omega-3 fatty acid cardiovascular benefits may outweigh methylmercury risks for some species of fish (e.g. farmed salmon, herring, trout), but not others (e.g. swordfish) (65943).\n\nMethylmercury accumulates in fish meat more than in fish oil, and fish oil supplements appear to contain almost no mercury. Fish oil supplements generally appear to be safe. Also, the manufacturing process used to deodorize fish oil supplements seems to lower levels of PCBs and other contaminants (12983). Laboratory analysis of fish oil supplements found no detectable levels of mercury or other toxins such as organochlorines in over 20 products tested (13009, 13012).\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): PCBs are found in fish living in polluted waters and in some farmed fish such as salmon. Freshwater fish such as lake trout, smelt, and freshwater bluefish frequently contain high levels of PCBs. PCBs may be carcinogenic. They may also adversely affect the central nervous system, causing memory loss (12965).\nDioxin: Dioxin and dioxin-like compounds have carcinogenic, immunosuppressive, central nervous system (disturbances in learning and memory), and other adverse effects. Farmed fish, especially salmon, can be fed with fish feed that is contaminated with dioxin, making dioxin levels 3-10 times higher than in wild salmon. European farmed salmon contains more dioxin than American farmed salmon. Most salmon consumed in the US is farm-raised salmon; wild salmon is considerably more costly. To avoid toxic amounts of dioxin, consumers should limit American farmed salmon consumption to fewer than 10 times/month and European farmed salmon to fewer than 4 times/month (12966).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOmega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in fish oil are well absorbed as ethyl esters or triglycerides (65837). Emulsified fish oil is often preferred as it is better absorbed in humans (65960, 116623). In one human study, a single dose of emulsified fish oil vs. capsular triglyceride fish oil resulted in enhanced absorption of EPA and DHA, based on changes in phospholipid fatty acids (65960).\n\nSome researchers have speculated that the triglyceride-bound EPA and DHA from fish oil is less bioavailable than the phospholipid-bound EPA and DHA from krill oil (15753, 104110, 116623). However, other clinical research shows that EPA and DHA from krill oil and fish oil are equally bioavailable (57836, 110375). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that EPA and DHA from krill meal, which is also incorporated into phospholipids, are not better absorbed than EPA and DHA from fish oil (91602).\nDistribution\nDietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids increases levels of omega-3 fatty acids in most cells of the body. Numerous studies have shown that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil and EPA/DHA alone) increases levels of omega-3 fatty acids in serum, plasma, leukocyte, monocyte, myocardial, and erythrocyte phospholipids (16790, 16791, 48108, 48120, 48129, 48183, 48203, 48265, 48275, 65501)(65567, 65570, 65639, 65687, 65702, 65754, 65774, 65809, 65822, 65829)(65869, 65898, 65926, 65930, 65948, 65960, 65961, 65971, 65978, 66040)(66060, 66119, 66172, 66356, 66518, 66519, 10154, 107186, 110345, 113222)(114188). Dietary omega-3 fatty acids have also demonstrated incorporation into fat tissues (66520). DHA is abundant in neural and retinal tissue (48138). In patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, supplemental fish oil resulted in a maximal increase of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiomyocyte phospholipids after 30 days of supplementation; arachidonic acid was the main fatty acid displaced (65773). In the same population, supplemental flaxseed resulted in a small increase in atrial EPA, but not DHA. In central Europe, supplementation of the mother with 200 mg of DHA daily from 21 weeks' gestation through lactation increased DHA in red blood cells of the mother and the infant and increased DHA in the breast milk (48212).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nSources of fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids include anchovy, black cod, bluefish, halibut, kipper, mackerel, menhaden, mullet, herring, pilchard, sable fish, salmon, sardine, seal blubber, sturgeon, trout, tuna, and whale blubber (90039). Shellfish, such as oyster, shrimp, and scallop, also contain omega-3 fatty acids, but in lesser amounts. These types of fish contain oil with long-chain polyunsaturated acids of the omega-3 family.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids refer to the hydrocarbon chains with a methyl group at one end (called the omega position) and a carboxyl group at the other. Omega-3 fatty acids have a double bond at the third carbon (n-3). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are two omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. EPA is sometimes written C20:5 omega-3 (20 carbons, 5 double bonds with the first at the n-3 position). DHA is C22:6 omega-3 (22 carbons, 6 double bonds with the first at the n-3 position) (12914). Fish oil supplements contain varying amounts of EPA and DHA (18-51% and 12-32%, respectively).\n\nThe body cannot produce the parent omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, nor can it convert omega-6 fatty acids, which are plentiful in the Western diet, into omega-3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA seem to have different physiologic effects than their precursor alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid (10323, 12918, 13763). Alpha-linolenic acid, even with long-term consumption, doesn't have the same effect as fish oil on triglyceride concentrations, on tissue DHA concentrations, or on in vitro susceptibility to oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (12918). However, the effects of fish oil and alpha-linolenic acid seem to be similar with respect to hemostatic factors such as thromboxane production, bleeding time, and other factors (13768).\n\nFish oil can change the way other dietary fatty acids are utilized. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil compete metabolically with omega-6 fatty acids and other omega-3 fatty acids in vegetable oils. Alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid are the primary omega-3 and omega-6 (respectively) fatty acids found in vegetable oils. Fish oil can modify the way these dietary fatty acids are incorporated into fatty acid chains and cell membranes and how they are used in other metabolic processes (7381, 8693, 9772). By increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, there is a simultaneous reduction of omega-6 fatty acids corresponding to an increase of omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes and circulatory lipids (8677, 113222). Although there is some concern that dietary vegetable oils in the diet might negate the beneficial cardiovascular effects of fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil seem to reduce cardiovascular risk factors despite concurrent omega-6 fatty acid ingestion (7381, 8693). The efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid containing products such as fish oil seems to be determined by an increased intake of omega-3 fatty-acids, a decreased intake of omega-6 fatty acids, and a decreased ratio of arachidonic acid to EPA and DHA (8671, 8694).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFish oil has anti-inflammatory effects and is of interest for a variety of inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and others. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, due to decreased levels of these fatty acids in the plasma and synovial fluid of these patients (5710, 13759, 110337). The anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil might explain the relationship shown in epidemiological research between fish consumption and lower risk of dry eye syndrome (13770).\n\nVarious mechanisms of action might explain the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and inhibit leukotriene synthesis (13759). Fish oils and omega-3 fatty acids appear to suppress mediators of immune function by reducing the production of cytokines and suppressing the synthesis and levels of interleukin-1 (alpha and beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (12471, 17523, 65716, 65721, 66007, 66016, 66229, 66377, 66510, 66511)(66512, 105225, 107190, 107194, 116624). Some clinical research suggests omega-3 fatty acids decrease endothelial activation by reducing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and thrombomodulin levels, indicating a reduction in inflammation (13754). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, fish oil has been shown to reduce the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (107188). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, taking fish oil increased levels of the anti-inflammatory D- and E-series resolvin and protectin precursors, 14- and 17-HDHA, and 15- and 18-HEPE (110337).\n\nDue to conflicting findings, it is unclear if taking fish oil reduces plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) or other inflammatory mediators in human research. In one clinical trial, taking omega-3 fatty acids along with simvastatin appears to reduce hs-CRP in coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD risk equivalent patients with dyslipidemias when compared to simvastatin alone (65606). In people at high cardiovascular risk, consuming high levels of omega-3 fatty acids from oily fish modestly reduces levels of hs-CRP (106074). Fish oil has also been shown to reduce CRP levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, patients with lung cancer, and patients undergoing hemodialysis (107188, 107190, 107194, 115740). However, in one study, although taking atorvastatin along with fish oil appears to reduce plasma levels of hs-CRP and IL-6 in dyslipidemic obese patients, taking fish oil alone has no effect (65537). Also, fish oil doesn't appear to affect CRP levels in otherwise healthy people, or patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (10155, 12925, 13735, 107189, 107197, 10815). It also does not appear to affect IL-6 levels in patients with lung cancer (107194).\n\nIn patients with schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome on long-term olanzapine, the decrease of triglyceride levels occurring after fish oil supplementation seems to be related to a decrease in TNF-alpha (105225).\nAnti-stress effects\nIn human research, fish oil blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels in healthy humans submitted to intravenous lipopolysaccharide (65741). In hemodialysis patients, fish oil reduced adrenal over-reactivity (reduced epinephrine) induced by oral glucose; glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were not affected (65812). In human research, omega-3 fatty acids decreased plasma norepinephrine (65639).\nAntiallergic effects\nPerinatal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation seems to reduce the prevalence of positive egg skin prick tests in the infant and the prevalence of childhood asthma, possibly by reducing cord blood interleukin-13 levels (66112).\nAntiarrhythmic properties\nFish oil may be beneficial for arrhythmias because EPA may block fast voltage-dependent sodium channels via specific binding, which results in prolongation of the inactivated states of these channels (66409, 66419). In dogs, the frequency of ectopic beats after myocardial infarction was reduced from 80% to less than 30% with omega-3 fatty acid ingestion (66304). There is evidence that omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in humans (7360, 66397, 66503); however, other studies reported conflicting results (14382, 16732, 65923, 89343, 114186).\nAntiasthmatic effects\nOmega-3 fatty acids seem to reduce the synthesis of leukotrienes by competing with and inhibiting the synthesis of arachidonic acid, suggesting usefulness for conditions such as asthma (13759). Sputum concentrations of leukotriene C4 and E4, prostaglandin D2, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were reduced in a clinical trial of patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction who were ingesting fish oil (65680). However, other research has not confirmed these results (66464).\nAntihypertensive effects\nDHA may have greater effects in reducing blood pressure than EPA (47975). Linoleic acid and fish oil fatty acids (administered by subcutaneous injection) were equally potent in reducing the rise in systolic arterial pressure induced by the chronic infusion of angiotensin II in rats (66209).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSome researchers think fish oil might also help prevent some forms of cancer. People with high EPA and DHA levels in their erythrocytes seem to have decreased rates of prostate cancer (6395). Animal and in vitro research suggests supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids slows the growth or inhibit the development of lung, colon, breast, pancreatic, intestinal/gastric, colorectal, and prostate cancers as well as lymphoma (6398, 13764, 65519, 65831, 65863, 65892, 66160, 66199, 66235, 66276)(66277, 66368, 66369, 66403, 91249). In humans, research suggests that modifying the omega-6/omega-3 ratio through dietary intervention plus fish oil supplements reduces the tumor progression marker Ki-67, in patients with prostate cancer (116625). EPA and DHA might compete with arachidonic acid as substrates for cyclooxygenases that produce prostaglandins that can enhance tumor growth (6385, 7378). There is evidence fish oil supplementation decreases the expression of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which has been found in prostate cancer tissue and is thought to play a role in promoting the growth of cancer cells (8689).\n\nThere is also preliminary evidence that high levels of EPA and DHA can be beneficial for prolonging cancer remission. Fish oil might decrease production of lactic acid by tumor cells. Lactic acidosis is a marker of unfavorable metabolic conditions associated with many cancers (6398).\n\nThere is also some evidence that fish oil might be cytotoxic to some cancer cells (1008). Preliminary evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are first oxidized and then accumulate in tumor cell membranes, resulting in cell membrane perforation and eventually tumor cell death (8691).\n\nIn vitro evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit ecto-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2) in human epithelial cells. ENOX2 is a protein on the cell surface of cancer cells that is involved in unregulated growth (66513).\n\nIn vitro, omega-3 fatty acids upregulate components of the transforming growth factor beta-1 pathway in ovarian cancer cell lines. Activation of this pathway can negatively regulate cell growth and reduce the risk of malignant transformation (65942).\nAntinociceptive effects\nClinical research shows that increasing dietary intakes of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA reduces the duration and frequency of migraine headaches. Taking these fatty acids increases levels of the DHA oxylipin metabolites, including 17-hydroxydocosahexaeonic acid (17- HDHA). This compound has antinociceptive effects in animal models and is associated with reduced pain in patients with osteoarthritis (105289).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn humans exposed to particulate matter, supplementation with fish oil increased Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels (65902). In patients with Alzheimer disease, taking fish oil increased activity of catalase and decreased oxidation of proteins and lipids. However, there was no effect on superoxide dismutase activity (110334). In vitro, DHA decreased oxidative stress in human fibroblasts (65683). GSH content was increased and was associated with elevated catalytic activities of gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl ligase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase.\nAntiplatelet effects\nSome research suggests that EPA and DHA might block the inflammatory, vasoconstrictive, and thrombogenic effects of omega-6 fatty acids (10007, 12914). Omega-3 fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Omega-3s are metabolized to products that inhibit platelet aggregation. Therefore fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids decrease synthesis of thromboxane A2 (and its precursor thromboxane B2) from arachidonic acid and increase the formation of thromboxane A3 (65847, 66087, 66128, 66243, 66294, 66321, 66364, 66383, 66391). Thromboxane A2 causes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, while thromboxane A3 does not (66216). By decreasing synthesis of thromboxane A2, omega-3 fatty acids decrease platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction (66128). Preliminary clinical evidence suggest fish oil supplements might prolong pregnancy and depress levels of thromboxane A2 which is thought to cause vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and reduced uteroplacental blood flow associated with pre-eclampsia (8707). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that fish oil might have an additive or synergistic effect with aspirin on inhibiting synthesis of thromboxane A2 and the highly inflammatory leukotriene B4 (8701), but it's too early to recommend this combination.\n\nFish oil can also cause increased production of prostacyclin and prostaglandin I3, prostaglandins that causes vasodilation and reduces platelet aggregation (8671, 8679, 8696, 66099, 66243, 66295). Fish oil decreases platelet adhesion in ADP-stimulated platelets (14821). However, fish oil 10 grams/day appears to have less effect on platelet function than 100 mg of aspirin given intravenously (13769).\n\nFish oil or omega-3 fatty acids may also increase fibrinolysis and vascular plasminogen activator levels, as well as altered levels of inhibitors of vascular plasminogen activator (66242, 65825, 66192, 66197, 65573, 65914) and prothrombin fragment 1-2 (65460).\nBone effects\nIn adult hyperlipidemic patients, dietary supplementation with a milk drink fortified with fish oil, olive oil, vitamins A, B6, and E, and folic acid improved nutritional status and bone formation markers (66063). Furthermore, clinical research shows that EPA plus DHA supplementation increases levels of osteocalcin and procollagen, as well as serum and urinary levels of calcium in females with osteoporosis, which suggest an improvement in calcium absorption and osteoblastic activity (66507). However, omega-3 fatty acids in combination with other agents have mixed effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in human research (21001, 66506, 65530, 65599). Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids alone do NOT seem to affect BMD. One study shows that taking fish oil containing 0.45 or 4.5 grams EPA plus DHA daily for 2 years does not improve bone mineral density in patients with knee osteoarthritis (96122).\nCardioprotective effects\nFish oil is used for cardiovascular conditions, including stroke and heart disease, due to anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects. Fish oil decreases blood viscosity, increases red blood cell deformability, and possibly provides protection against red cell hemolysis. Vasodilatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil may also prevent increases in blood pressure and maintain renal function. For example, fish oil can cause increased production of prostacyclin, a prostaglandin that causes vasodilation (8671, 8679, 8696). Fish oil may have an antiarrhythmic effect. There is some evidence prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid are pro-arrhythmic, whereas equivalent prostaglandins derived from EPA are not. Preclinical research suggests fish oil might have a membrane stabilizing effect (12987). Fish oil might regulate calcium movement through calcium channels in the heart and suppress intracellular calcium activity, which has been associated with arrhythmias. Increased dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids increases the amount of EPA and DHA in cell membranes, which is thought to cause changes in enzyme and receptor function that secondarily leads to changes in calcium fluxes across cell membranes (8676). There's also some evidence fish oil might affect sodium and potassium channels and inhibit ischemia-induced arrhythmias (7362, 7363, 8671, 8676, 8677, 8687, 13767). Preliminary clinical research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids have antiarrhythmic effects, but do not induce arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (13752). Regular consumption of fish seems to decrease heart rate, which might protect against cardiovascular events. Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, especially DHA, are associated with decreased heart rate (65746).\n\nFish oil might also protect the heart by reducing inflammation and thrombosis, and inhibiting atherosclerosis (10154, 11344, 12919, 12920, 13751, 98250). However, animal research suggests that long-term use of fish oil with or without aspirin does not prevent atherosclerosis in venous bypass grafts (13749). Additionally, some observational research has found that dietary or supplemental intake of fish oil is not associated with reduced plaque formation or plaque size (98251).\n\nFish oil might also improve arterial flow. In some patients, fish oil appears to improve arterial compliance (1029, 5707). Preliminary research suggests fish oil can reduce aortic wall thickness in hypertensive animals (14040). Research in adults with familial hypertension shows that taking fish oil 4 grams orally daily for 8 weeks improves post-prandial arterial elasticity following a fat load when compared with no intervention (111458). In other human research, marine omega-3 fatty acids improved large artery endothelium-dependent dilation in subjects with hypercholesterolemia without affecting endothelium-independent dilation (5702). However, in healthy adults, fish oil supplementation does not improve flow-mediated dilation or reduce the effects of prolonged sitting on leg endothelial function (102402).\n\nFish oil also seems to reduce the death of cardiomyocytes, which increases in left ventricular hypertrophy (14039).\n\nIn humans, red blood cell levels of omega-3 fatty acids were inversely associated with ventricular fibrillation during the acute ischemic phase of a myocardial infarction (65877). Overall, a 1% increase in the omega-3 index was associated with a 48% reduction in risk of ventricular fibrillation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.96; p=0.037).\n\nIn hypertriglyceridemic men, DHA decreased fasting plasma remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C) and improved the red blood cell omega-3 index, novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease (65826). In hypertriglyceridemic men, DHA decreased levels of triglyceride as well as small, dense LDL particles (48174). In humans with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa and IIb, ex vivo and in vivo, platelet activation parameters exhibited signs of decreased activation by a six-week diet supplemented with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which might be beneficial in reducing atherothrombotic risk (66515). In healthy volunteers, DHA improved lymphocyte activation (increased IL-2 mRNA following stimulation) and increased monocyte resistance to oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis (48226). Supplementary DHA and arachidonic acid (omega-6) resulted in increased coronary flow velocity reserve in Japanese elderly individuals (65781).\nImmune effects\nFish oil can suppress mediators of immune function by reducing the production of cytokines such as interleukin-1(IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Some researchers think fish oil might prevent weight loss in cancer patients by inhibiting cytokines, which cause muscle catabolism. Fish oil also suppresses T- and B-cell proliferation and decrease delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response (DTH). They also decrease antibody production and increase free radical activity. In patients with IgA nephropathy, omega-3 fatty acids seem to reduce renal inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (1313, 7383, 7384, 11979, 13756, 65775, 65968). However, other human studies have found a lack of effect of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory cytokines (66490, 65957, 65985, 65702).\n\nIn human research, omega-3 fatty acids increased synthesis of leukotriene B5 and suppression of leukotriene B4 synthesis by ionophore-stimulated neutrophils (1040, 65568). In healthy volunteers, DHA improved lymphocyte activation (increased IL-2 mRNA following stimulation) and increased monocyte resistance to oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis (48226). In male volunteers, DHA-rich fish oil stimulated an increase in phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, and increased neutrophil chemotactic response (48129). In older men, EPA caused a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophil respiratory burst and a reduction in prostaglandin E2 in younger and older men (65687).\n\nIn human research, fish oil supplementation reduced CD44 expression and increased CD44v3 expression in cultured monocytes of peripheral arterial disease patients (65903). In healthy men, fish oil had immunostimulating effects, resulting in an increased zymosan-induced oxidative burst (65829).\n\nThere is also interest in using fish oil in pregnant females with obesity to improve immune mediators in colostrum breast milk. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 2.4 grams (containing DHA 1.9 grams and EPA 0.22 grams) orally once daily, beginning early in pregnancy, reduces colostrum levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-12, when compared with placebo (111454).\n\nA fish oil-enriched diet increased survival of mice following Klebsiella pneumonia infection compared to a control diet (olive oil- or corn oil-enriched diet) (66462). Fish oil as the exclusive source of lipid suppressed autoimmune lupus in MKL-lpR mice by decreasing lymphoid hyperplasia and macrophage surface Ia expression, as well as delaying the onset of renal disease (66280). In another mouse model of lupus, suppression of autoimmune disease by DHA and EPA was felt to be related to a decrease in interleukin-1-beta gene transcription (66275, 66315, 66384). In animal studies after transplant, intravenous alimentation with fish oil-derived lipid emulsions prolonged heart transplant survival compared to omega-6 lipids (66395).\nInfant development effects\nEpidemiological research directly associates consumption of fish and fish oil in pregnancy with higher birth weight and length, and larger head circumference. However, very high consumption of fish and fish oil is also associated with smaller birth size and head circumference (13746).\n\nThere is interest in using fish oil supplements to increase maternal supply of omega-3 fatty acids to the fetus. Taking fish oil 4 grams daily from 20 weeks gestation until delivery significantly increases EPA and DHA levels in the mother at 30 and 37 weeks gestation and for 6-weeks post-partum. EPA and DHA levels were also significantly higher in the erythrocytes of the newborn infants (15015).\n\nAnimal studies suggest that perinatal omega-3 maternal supplementation may result in a lower fat mass of the offspring (66108).\nLipid effects\nFish oil may decrease cholesterol absorption from the gut and decrease cholesterol synthesis (5707). There is evidence fish and fish oil increase high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and decrease the total cholesterol to HDL ratio (2318, 5707, 8674, 8678, 8698, 113210). Fish oil may increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (2299, 2318, 8678, 8698) by increasing the size of LDL particles (9771). It is thought that fish oil might cause a more buoyant LDL to be formed, which might be less atherogenic (2299, 8678).\n\nIn hypertriglyceridemia, fish oil is thought to lower triglycerides by decreasing secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), increasing VLDL apolipoprotein B secretion, possibly by increasing VLDL clearance, and reducing triglyceride transport (5707). In addition, fish oil appears to decrease synthesis of VLDL by inhibiting 1,2-diacylglycerol-sterol o-acyltransferase or phosphatidate phosphatase (6394). Fish oil may decrease chylomicron concentrations. More lipoprotein lipase becomes available due to decreased VLDL levels, which causes increased hydrolysis of chylomicrons (6394). Fish oil also increases fatty acid oxidation by peroxisomal and mitochondrial routes, reduce fatty acid synthesis, divert fatty acids into phospholipid synthesis, increase hepatic uptake of triglycerides, and down-regulate fatty acid esterifying enzymes (5707).\n\nThere is some evidence that vitamin B12 used with fish oil might have additive effects in lowering cholesterol, but the mechanism for this effect is unknown (8894). Fish oil also improves flow-mediated arterial dilation in people with hypercholesterolemia (5702). Unlike some other kinds of dietary fat, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil do not seem to impair endothelial function, which is thought to be a precursor to atherogenesis (5702, 7382).\n\nIt was initially suggested that fish oil fatty acids are utilized in the liver for the synthesis of phospholipids, located on the surface of lipoproteins (66324). However, in the majority of studies reporting reductions in total cholesterol and LDL, saturated fat intake was lowered when switching from a control diet to a fish oil diet. When fish oil was administered to subjects under constant saturated fat intake, there was no effect on total cholesterol levels (66222). Nevertheless, there were reports that even under such rigorously controlled conditions (e.g., at low and high fixed concentrations of saturated fatty acids), fish oil was capable of lowering plasma total cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL (66394, 66214, 59271).\n\nIn hens, fish oil increased expression of some PPAR-alpha target genes and decreased the nuclear concentration of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-2 in the liver (45397). PPAR-alpha activation has been shown to reduce cholesterol synthesis by reducing SREBP-2 abundance.\n\nThere is interest in using fish oil in combination with \"statin\" drugs for mixed hyperlipidemia patients. There has been concern about whether taking fish oil might interfere with statin therapy. Preliminary evidence shows that fish oil does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of the statin drug simvastatin (15116).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nFish oil has been tried for improving muscle growth in elderly people and improving muscular performance in athletes during exercise. This is because the anti-inflammatory effects of fish oils are thought to inhibit muscle damage after exercise, allowing for more muscular growth. Evidence from a small clinical trial shows that consuming fish oil containing 600 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 260 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily for 8 weeks seems to improve maximal voluntary contraction, muscle soreness and range of motion compared to placebo in healthy men performing eccentric contraction exercise (98257). Other preliminary research in untrained adult males shows that taking fish oil daily for 4 to 6 weeks lowers plasma creatine kinase, and possibly lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels, when compared with control or placebo (111450, 114188). However, other clinical research in trained males shows that taking fish oil 5 grams, containing EPA 1882 mg and DHA 485 mg, orally daily for 4 weeks does not lower plasma creatine kinase levels after eccentric exercises when compared with placebo (111451).\nNeurologic/psychiatric effects\nIn depression, omega-3s might normalize altered neuronal membrane microstructure and faulty neurotransmission. Omega-3s might also play a role in correcting defects in the arachidonic acid cascade, which is involved in second messenger processes that affect neurotransmitter uptake (10871). A diet deficient in omega-3 fatty acids may affect the fatty acid composition of cells in the central nervous system and alter neural function, including intellectual or cognitive development. Reduced omega-3 fatty acid levels have been reported in people with schizophrenia, and it is suggested that dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism contributes to the disorder. Omega-3 fatty acids might alter membrane fluidity and receptor responses when incorporated into cell membranes, and they might interact with dopaminergic and serotonergic systems (17084). Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids 2.2 grams daily for 26 weeks modestly improves symptoms and also seems to attenuate loss of cortical brain thickness compared to placebo in patients with schizophrenia (97183, 97184).\n\nDHA is thought to be important for normal neural function and might play a key role in the structural development of neural and synaptic membranes (8704, 8705, 8803). There is preliminary evidence that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, might affect retinal, visual, learning, and memory function (8704, 8705, 8715). However, omega-3 fatty acids might be beneficial only up to a point. Taking fish oil seems to improve the processing of information by the brain during cognitive tasks (109310).\n\nIn individuals with bipolar disorder, the fatty acids in fish oil are thought to have an effect similar to lithium or valproate, slowing nerve signaling (7202).\n\nAlthough some conflicting evidence exists (65821), several studies suggest that moderate consumption of fish or increased omega-3 intake is associated with a reduced risk of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression (65767, 65794). An inverse correlation between intake of omega-3 fatty acids and severity of depression has also been noted (10859). Also, a positive correlation between the ratio of erythrocyte phospholipid arachidonic acid to EPA and depression severity has also been observed (65867, 65934, 66410). In addition, low levels of DHA and elevated omega-6:omega-3 ratios have been shown to be associated with predicted suicide, depressive symptomology, and neuroticism (65713, 65815).\n\nA greater frequency of behavior problems assessed by the Conner Rating Scale, temper tantrums and sleep disturbances have been registered in young males with lower total omega-3 fatty acids in plasma phospholipids (66413). Also, fish oil has been proposed as a treatment for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) due to epidemiological data that suggests symptoms of ADHD might be inversely related to the omega 3-fatty acid phospholipid content (5711).\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are also of interest for their neuroprotective effects related to neuropathies. Clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil for 6 months improves the length of the central corneal nerve fiber (106072).\nRenal effects\nIn 10 young healthy subjects whose diets were supplemented daily with omega-3 PUFAs 6 grams containing EPA 3.6 grams and DHA 2.4 grams, a significant increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, as well as decreased vascular resistance, occurred (66195). However, no such effects were observed in elderly subjects who took EPA 1.7 grams daily for 4 weeks (66466).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is interest in using fish oil to protect the lungs from pollution. A small clinical trial in young adults with low omega-3 status shows that, when compared with olive oil or no supplement, taking fish oil (Pharmavite, LLC) 3 grams daily for 4 weeks has a modest protective effect on lung function during an acute exposure to air containing ozone 300 ppb. Each gram of fish oil provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 410 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 274 mg as ethyl ester (109291).\nWeight loss effects\nAlthough there is interest in using fish oil to improve weight loss, most clinical research shows that fish oil supplements are not effective in overweight or obese individuals (15737, 66004, 89355, 89356, 100247, 100250, 106073). However, taking fish oil has been shown to increase the resting metabolic rate in overweight and obese adults (107177)."

Ventricular tachycardia occurred in one patient with a history of ischemic heart disease following chronic ingestion of African wild potato extract (13581).\nless\nKIDNEY DISEASE\nAnimal research suggests that chronic use of aqueous extract of African wild potato significantly decreases urinary sodium output and glomerular filtration rate. Acute doses seem to reduce urine flow and decrease sodium and potassium output (30484). Theoretically, African wild potato might further impair kidney function in individuals with kidney disease.\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nAfrican wild potato might affect blood glucose levels (11236). Theoretically, African wild potato might interfere with blood glucose control during and after surgical procedures. Tell patients to discontinue African wild potato at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless\nSITOSTEROLEMIA (PHYTOSTEROLEMIA)\nThe beta-sitosterol constituent of African wild potato can exacerbate sitosterolemia, a rare inherited lipid storage disease (5326, 10305). People with this disorder have increased absorption of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol from the diet, and decreased clearance of beta-sitosterol. Total body stores of beta-sitosterol are increased up to 17-fold. Elevated hepatic beta-sitosterol levels competitively inhibit cholesterol catabolism, contributing to hypercholesterolemia (3663). Patients with sitosterolemia are prone to premature coronary artery disease and xanthomas (3661, 3662). Beta-sitosterol and its glycoside, sitosterolin, are contraindicated in patients with sitosterolemia. However, beta-sitosterol appears to be safe for heterozygous carriers of sitosterolemia (10457).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the toxic effects of African wild potato.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nHypoxoside, a constituent of African wild potato, is converted to rooperol in the gut prior to absorption (94283).\nMetabolism\nRooperol is rapidly metabolized in the colon and liver to diglucuronide, disulphate and mixed glucuronide-sulphate metabolites (30489, 94283).\nExcretion\nRooperol is excreted in the urine mainly as diglucuronide, disulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates (30488).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of African wild potato is the rootstalk, or corm. The African wild potato corm contains 3.5% to 4.5% lignans. Hypoxoside, a norlignan glycoside, is the primary lignan constituent (13582, 94283). African wild potato also contains beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterolin, and is sometimes used as a commercial source of beta-sitosterol (5327, 5328, 7198).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThe anti-cancer effects of African wild potato might be related to rooperol, a metabolite of the constituent hypoxoside. In laboratory research, rooperol inhibits the potential for cancer cell invasion and also demonstrates antioxidant effects (94283). African wild potato is also a source of beta-sitosterol, which is thought to decrease prostate cell proliferation (5328).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that African wild potato might have anti-inflammatory and free-radical scavenging activity. African wild potato seems to inhibit the production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 prostaglandin biosynthesis (13583). The anti-inflammatory effects of African wild potato might be related to rooperol, a metabolite of the constituent hypoxoside. Rooperol inhibits the enzyme lipoxygenase, potentially reducing the formation of inflammatory eicosanoids. Rooperol also appears to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines (94283). The anti-inflammatory effects of African wild potato and its constituents might explain the potential benefits of the extract for benign prostatic hyperplasia (94283).\nAntibacterial effects\nAfrican wild potato seems to modestly inhibit Escherichia coli growth. However, it is unlikely to have an antibacterial effect at the doses typically used (13583).\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) effects\nIn vitro research shows that African wild potato extract inhibits the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4/5 (94281). However, CYP inhibitory activity has not been reported or evaluated in humans.\nHypoglycemic effects\nAnimal research suggests that African wild potato might lower blood glucose levels (11236, 30483). The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but the effect is theorized to be due to its phytosterol content (94283)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Flaxseed oil is derived from the flaxseed. Flaxseed oil contains fatty acids, of which approximately 55% is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid (5899, 11025, 16792, 25691, 26467).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes, short-term. Flaxseed oil has been used safely in doses up to 2 grams daily for up to 6 months. Higher doses of up to 24 grams daily has been safely used for up to 7 weeks (845, 3912, 5898, 14443, 16789, 16791, 16794, 16795, 17523, 101951, 101952, 101955).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used topically for medicinal purposes, short-term. Flaxseed oil has been used safely on the wrist for up to 4 weeks (25691). ...when used in eye drops twice daily for up to 90 days (101953).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Some evidence suggests that flaxseed oil, providing 200 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, can be safely used in children for up to 3 months (14443).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes, short-term. Although flaxseed oil has been used with apparent safety in clinical research in doses of 1-2 grams daily for up to 6 weeks (96432, 101957), some population research has found that consuming flaxseed oil during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is associated with a four-fold increased risk of premature birth (16797).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, flaxseed oil is generally well tolerated. Topically, flaxseed oil seems to be well-tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nTopically: Itching, redness.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.\nEndocrine\nOrally, flaxseed oil might cause gynecomastia. In a case report, a 70-year-old male developed gynecomastia after taking flaxseed oil daily for 3 months. Discontinuing flaxseed oil lead to resolution of gynecomastia (105478).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, flaxseed oil may cause a change in bowel habits, dry mouth, and dyspepsia when taken at a dose of about 5 grams daily. However, these effects have been reported by only a small number of patients (approximately 3%) (16794). High doses of flaxseed oil (30 grams per day and higher) have been associated with loose stools and diarrhea (5898, 11025).\nless\nImmunologic\nSevere allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis have been reported with flaxseed oil ingestion and also in workers processing flaxseed products (6809).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nTopically, eye drops containing flaxseed oil may cause redness and itching (101953).\nless\nOncologic\nFlaxseed oil has not been linked to increased prostate cancer risk. Although epidemiologic research has found that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is associated with increased prostate cancer risk (1337, 2558, 7147, 7823, 12978), this risk does not seem to apply to ALA from plant sources, like flaxseed (12909).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBipolar disorder. Oral flaxseed oil does not seem to reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder in children.\nClinical research in children ages 6-17 years with bipolar disorder shows that taking flaxseed oil, titrated to provide up to 6.5 grams of the flaxseed oil constituent alpha-linolenic acid, daily for 16 weeks does not improve symptoms of mania or depression when compared with placebo (66044).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral flaxseed oil does not seem to reduce cholesterol levels.\nAlthough some evidence from preliminary, low-quality clinical studies disagrees (21698, 26466, 76696), most clinical research shows that taking flaxseed oil does not reduce cholesterol or triglyceride levels in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia (2317, 16791, 16794, 21693, 21694, 21696, 21697, 22177, 72228, 101947)(101954, 101956, 111062). A meta-analysis of clinical studies evaluating various flaxseed formulations suggests that flaxseed oil consumption may reduce apolipoprotein A levels, but not apolipoprotein B levels, when compared with control groups (108046). A subgroup analysis from another meta-analysis suggests that flaxseed oil may modestly improve levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (108044).\n\nIt should be noted that most research suggests that flaxseed, the source of flaxseed oil, can improve lipid levels in adults with hyperlipidemia. This difference may be due to lipid lowering components such as lignans, phytic acid, and polyphenols, that are found in flaxseed, but not flaxseed oil. See the Flaxseed monograph for more information.\nless\nObesity. Oral flaxseed oil does not seem to improve weight loss.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in overweight adults shows that flaxseed oil consumption does not reduce body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference when compared with control (96427). This is in contrast to research suggesting that flaxseed, the source of flaxseed oil, can improve weight loss in obese and overweight adults. See the Flaxseed monograph for more information.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral flaxseed oil does not seem to improve symptoms of RA.\nA small clinical study in patients with RA shows that taking flaxseed oil daily for 3 months does not seem to improve symptoms of pain and stiffness, and has no effect on laboratory measures of RA, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), when compared with control (5898).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. Small clinical trials show that taking flaxseed oil has modest benefit on metabolic risk factors in patients with plaque in the coronary artery.\nObservational research in White adults has found that high dietary intake of linolenic acid, a flaxseed oil constituent, is associated with reduced calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (12990). However, clinical research has not confirmed this finding. A small clinical trial in patients with coronary artery disease shows that taking flaxseed oil 5 grams in milk containing 1.5% fat reduces triglyceride levels by 14% when compared with the milk alone. However, there was no effect on systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (101954). Additionally, another small study in a similar patient population shows that taking flaxseed oil 2 grams daily for 12 weeks has no effect on lipid levels when compared with placebo (101956).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral flaxseed oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in children with ADHD shows that taking flaxseed oil, providing 200 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, in combination with vitamin C 25 mg, twice daily can improve measures of attention, impulsivity, restlessness, and self-control when compared to baseline (14443). This finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefit is due to flaxseed oil, vitamin C, or the combination.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil reduces the risk of breast cancer.\nPopulation research has found that females with higher levels of the flaxseed oil constituent, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in breast adipose tissue have a lower risk of breast cancer. Fatty acid composition of adipose tissue is thought to reflect past dietary intake, so researchers think high intake of ALA might have a cancer protective effect (7168, 21689). Flaxseed oil is one source of ALA; it is unclear what effect, if any, flaxseed oil has on breast cancer risk.\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil improves wound healing and health in people with burns.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate burns shows that eating cookies containing flaxseed oil 30 grams and isolated soy protein (ISP) 50 grams daily for 3 weeks improves the rate of wound healing when compared with control cookies. It seems to take at least 3 weeks before this difference is observed. However, there is no significant difference in the rate of wound healing when compared with cookies containing ISP with corn oil (99401). It is possible that the study was underpowered to detect a difference between these two groups.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil reduces the risk of CVD.\nFlaxseed oil is a source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). A meta-analysis of observational studies has found that, overall, increasing dietary intake of ALA by 1.2 grams daily is associated with a 20% reduced risk of fatal coronary heart disease in people with existing heart disease (12978). Some research suggests that ALA has a greater impact on coronary heart disease when intake of fish oils is low (12989). It is unknown if flaxseed oil supplements have these same effects. Additionally, it is difficult to separate effects of dietary ALA in these studies from those of other dietary, lifestyle, or drug interventions (12917).\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if topical flaxseed oil reduces carpal tunnel pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who wear a wrist splint at night shows that applying flaxseed oil 5 drops topically on the palmar wrist twice daily for 4 weeks improves subjective symptom scores by 30%, function scores by 17%, and sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve by about 7% when compared to baseline. Compared to the changes observed for patients in the placebo group, these improvements were significant (25691). It is unclear if this benefit persists long-term or how topical flaxseed oil compares to other standard treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Although there is interest in using oral flaxseed oil for CKD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of flaxseed for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil improves cognitive function in healthy adults.\nClinical research in healthy older Japanese adults with normal cognitive function shows that taking flaxseed oil 3.7 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly improves verbal fluency when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on other measures of cognitive function, including attention, concentration, and memory (111060).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral flaxseed oil may not improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there may be some benefit in patients with gestational diabetes.\nMost clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking flaxseed oil, providing about 1-16 grams of alpha-linolenic acid, daily for up to 6 months does not improve fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), or insulin resistance when compared with placebo (16792, 66065, 96428, 96431, 101956, 111062).\n\nWhile taking flaxseed oil does not seem to be beneficial for type 2 diabetes, it might improve outcomes in gestational diabetes. A small clinical study in pregnant patients (24-28 weeks gestation) with gestational diabetes shows that taking flaxseed oil 1 gram twice daily for 6 weeks reduces fasting levels of glucose and insulin and improves insulin resistance when compared with placebo (101957). Another small clinical study in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking flaxseed oil 1 gram, containing 400 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, along with vitamin E 400 IU daily for 6 weeks reduces blood glucose levels, insulin levels, and insulin resistance and improves beta-cell function when compared with placebo (96432). It is unclear if the findings from this latter study are due to flaxseed oil, vitamin E, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil improves the healing of diabetic foot ulcers.\nOne small clinical trial in adults with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking flaxseed oil 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks in conjunction with intravenous antibiotics for the first 3 weeks reduces ulcer size when compared with placebo (96431).\nless\nDry eye. Flaxseed oil, both orally and as an eye drop, has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with dry eye shows that taking a specific combination product (TheraTears Nutrition, Advanced Vision Research) containing eicosapentaenoic acid 450 mg, docosahexaenoic acid 300 mg, and flaxseed oil 1000 mg daily for 90 days reduces subjective symptoms of dry eye and might increase tear production when compared with placebo. However, it did not improve meibomian gland secretions or tear evaporation rate when compared with placebo (17523).\n\nEye drops with flaxseed oil have also been tried for dry eye. A clinical study shows that using a specific product (Refresh Optive MEGA-3 Preservative-Free Lubricant Eye Drops, Allergan plc) which contains flaxseed oil and trehalose in addition to other ingredients such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and castor oil twice daily for 90 days improves dry eye symptoms when compared to baseline, but not when compared with the same eye drops formulated without flaxseed oil and trehalose (101953).\nless\nDry skin. There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of flaxseed oil for dry skin.\nSome clinical research suggests that taking flaxseed oil 2.2 grams orally in combination with alpha-tocopherol 10 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve skin hydration when compared with placebo or borage oil in females with dry skin, although the combination seems to improve the sensitivity of dry skin (21908). Other clinical research suggests that taking flaxseed oil 2.2 grams daily for 12 weeks improves skin hydration and roughness when compared with safflower oil (21909).\nless\nEndometrial hyperplasia. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil reduces endometrial hyperplasia.\nA small clinical trial in adults with endometrial hyperplasia shows that taking flaxseed oil 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks does not induce endometrial regression or reduce cholesterol levels when compared with placebo. However, there appears to be a small benefit on fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels (101955).\nless\nHypertension. Small studies suggest that flaxseed oil may modestly lower blood pressure in some patients.\nEpidemiological research has found that high dietary intake of linolenic acid, a flaxseed oil constituent, is associated with a reduced risk of developing hypertension (12991). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies in patients with and without hypertension show that receiving flaxseed oil 1.2-30 grams daily for 4-24 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 0.5 mmHg to 4 mmHg, when compared with control (96426, 111063). One meta-analysis limited to small clinical trials in patients with metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension, shows that taking flaxseed oil 25 mL or 2.2 to 9.2 grams daily for 7-12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 3.9 mmHg; however, there is no effect on diastolic blood pressure (111067). The small size and heterogeneity of the studies included in these meta-analysis limit the validity of these findings. Also, the effect of taking flaxseed oil in patients specifically with hypertension is unclear from this available research.\n\nFlaxseed oil has also been evaluated in combination with other oils and dietary interventions, with mixed evidence of benefit. Flaxseed oil 19 grams, providing 10.5 grams of alpha-linolenic acid, seems to reduce blood pressure when combined with walnuts and walnut oil daily for 6 weeks (21905). However, consuming 60 grams of a combination of flaxseed and safflower oils in a 6:4 ratio daily for 4 weeks does not seem to affect blood pressure when compared with baseline (26466).\nless\nMastalgia. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil is beneficial in patients with mastalgia.\nA clinical study in adults with fibrocystic breasts and mastalgia shows that taking flaxseed oil 1000 mg containing 350 mg alpha-linolenic acid twice daily for 2 months reduces pain when compared with baseline, but is no different than taking vitamin E 200 IU daily (105477).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking flaxseed oil 20 mL daily for 7 weeks does not improve coagulation scores based on prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and the international normalized ratio (INR) when compared with sunflower oil (101951).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nClinical research in overweight or obese patients with NAFLD shows that taking flaxseed oil 20 grams daily for 12 weeks as part of a hypocaloric diet improves the grade of fatty liver by 41%, compared with 18% in patients taking sunflower oil. There was also a small effect on body mass index, although there was no effect on liver enzymes, glycemic control, or body composition (101952).\nless\nParkinson disease. Oral flaxseed oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease shows that taking flaxseed oil 1 gram daily plus vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks improves the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score by 3.3 points, compared to a 4.4-point worsening in the placebo group (96430). However, it is unclear if this change is clinically meaningful. The minimal clinically important improvement in UPDRS total score is 4.3 points, while a moderate improvement ranges from 9 to 17 points (95686). Also, it is not clear if these findings are due to flaxseed oil, vitamin E, or the combination.\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil improves physical performance in older adults.\nA small clinical study in elderly adults without previous exercise training suggests that flaxseed oil containing alpha-linolenic acid does not improve muscle strength when compared with placebo (65937).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil helps to prevent pneumonia.\nEpidemiological research has found that increasing dietary alpha-linolenic acid, which occurs in flaxseed oil, is associated with a reduced risk of community-acquired pneumonia (13760). However, this research did not specifically assess the effect of flaxseed oil intake on pneumonia.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral flaxseed oil might help to improve some markers of PCOS.\nA small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking flaxseed oil, providing 545 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, for 6 weeks lowers triglycerides but does not affect weight, hormone levels, glycemic control, or cholesterol levels when compared to baseline (21906). This finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Another small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking flaxseed oil, providing 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids, twice daily in addition to metformin for 12 weeks decreases triglyceride and insulin levels, but does not affect fasting blood glucose, testosterone levels, free androgen index, or total cholesterol when compared with placebo (99402).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral flaxseed oil does not seem to be linked to prostate cancer risk.\nAlthough some epidemiologic research has found that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid, a constituent of flaxseed oil, is associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer (1334, 1337, 2558, 7823, 7147, 12978, 12961), other research has found no association (12961, 15736). Furthermore, it appears that alpha-linolenic acid from plant sources, such as flaxseed or flaxseed oil, does not increase prostate cancer risk (12909).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral flaxseed oil is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nA small open-label clinical study in patients with ulcerative colitis shows that taking flaxseed oil 10 grams daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce inflammatory markers and disease severity and improve quality of life when compared with control (101941).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate flaxseed oil for these uses.",

Theoretically, combining flaxseed oil with other herbs and supplements with hypotensive effects might increase the risk of hypotension.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "PERIOPERATIVE\nThere is concern that flaxseed oil might increase the risk of bleeding if used perioperatively. There is some evidence that flaxseed oil can decrease platelet aggregation and increase bleeding time (5898, 21912). Tell patients to discontinue flaxseed oil at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with flaxseed oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a precursor to the longer and more unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are found in fish oils (845, 6803). The body converts small amounts of ALA into EPA and DHA (10007). Taking flaxseed oil 2.4-3.6 grams daily significantly increases erythrocyte EPA and DHA levels (16790). The amount of EPA or DHA made from ALA is not likely to be clinically significant (7141). Taking flaxseed oil 20 grams daily, providing 10.7 grams ALA, for 4 weeks significantly increases EPA levels in breast milk, but does not increase DHA levels in breast milk (16795).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFlaxseed oil is a rich source of fatty acids, containing about 70% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 18% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 9% saturated fatty acids. Up to 55% of the fatty acid content of flaxseed oil is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid. This makes flaxseed oil one of the richest food sources of ALA (5899, 11025). ALA is a precursor to the longer and more unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are found in fish oils (845, 6803). The body converts small amounts of ALA into EPA and DHA (10007). Taking flaxseed oil 2.4-3.6 grams daily significantly increases erythrocyte EPA and DHA levels (16790). However, alpha-linolenic acid from flaxseed oil does not necessarily have the same physiological effects as EPA and DHA. The amount of EPA made from alpha-linolenic acid is not likely to be clinically significant. Conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to DHA is even less. High dose or long-term consumption of modest amounts of dietary alpha-linolenic acid does not duplicate the effects of preformed EPA+DHA (7141, 7165, 10323, 12918, 13763).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is some evidence that alpha-linolenic acid from flaxseed oil might have anti-tumor effects, possibly by increasing peroxidation of fatty acids in tumor cell membranes or by altering the balance of prostaglandin production away from tumor promoting prostaglandins of the E2 series (6805). Flaxseed oil seems to reduce the volume of chemically-induced mammary tumors in animal models (6805).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nMost clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking flaxseed oil does not improve fasting blood glucose or insulin resistance; however, some research disagrees (16792, 66065, 96428, 96431, 101956, 111062). Human research has found a negative correlation found between insulin resistance and serum levels of free alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) following flaxseed oil intake. However, there is no correlation with serum total ALA (111068).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nFlaxseed oil is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. Although some research disagrees (96249), most clinical research shows that taking flaxseed oil reduces at least some inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and improves antioxidant status (26467, 101951, 101955, 101956, 101957, 105479). The alpha-linolenic acid constituent of flaxseed oil has also been reported to suppress the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leukotriene B4, and oxygen free radicals by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and monocytes (6806). Alpha-linolenic acid contained in flaxseed oil is converted in small amounts to EPA and DHA, which are converted to non- or anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes in the body. Supplementation with flaxseed oil or alpha-linolenic acid increases the ratio of EPA and DHA to the pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (5898, 11025).\nBone effects\nThere is some evidence to suggest that flaxseed oil reduces bone turnover. It reduces serum levels of N-telopeptide, which is mobilized from bone by osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells). Also, omega-3 fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid, which is present in flaxseed oil, decrease production of prostaglandin E2, which promotes differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. Flaxseed oil does not affect levels of osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation), or osteoprotegerin (an inhibitor of bone resorption). These effects have been studied in people on chronic hemodialysis, who have an increased rate of bone turnover (99070).\nCardiovascular effects\nFlaxseed oil might have beneficial cardiovascular effects. There is preliminary evidence that a low fat diet plus flaxseed oil can increase systemic arterial elasticity, which might improve circulatory function (5896). However, flaxseed oil and the fatty acid constituent alpha-linolenic acid do not appear to lower total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (7146, 7165, 11025, 16791, 96249). Alpha-linolenic acid contained in flaxseed oil might actually slightly increase triglyceride levels (12918). There is also some evidence that the alpha-linolenic acid contained in flaxseed oil has antiarrhythmic effects, but researchers are not sure if this is due to alpha-linolenic acid itself, or due to the longer-chain fatty acids EPA and DHA, to which some alpha-linolenic acid is converted (7153, 7156). A reduced risk of abnormally prolonged myocardial repolarization is associated with a diet higher in alpha-linolenic acid (12988). Flaxseed oil might also decrease blood pressure (16793) and decrease platelet aggregation (845, 5898, 6806); however there is some conflicting data regarding the effects of flaxseed oil on bleeding time (3912, 10323, 11025). Flaxseed oil is also a source of the omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid. Some research also suggests that higher serum levels of linoleic acid might also have beneficial cardiovascular effects, possibly by lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow by reducing platelet aggregation and enhancing erythrocyte deformability (9562).\nHemostatic effects\nThe effects of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA, DHA, and alpha-linolenic acid seem to be similar with respect to hemostatic factors such as thromboxane production, bleeding time, and other factors (13768).\nOcular effects\nThe alpha-linolenic acid constituent of flaxseed oil has been reported to suppress the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leukotriene B4, and oxygen free radicals by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and monocytes (6806). By blocking inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1, flaxseed oil might increase tear secretions and reduce symptoms of dry eye (17523)."

    "Fluoride": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Fluoride is the ion of the element fluorine. Due to its high affinity for calcium, it is often found in calcified tissues in the body, such as bones and teeth (7555).",
            "Warnings": "Currently, the FDA requires this warning on all fluoride toothpastes: \"If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional help or contact a poison control center.\" The warning is intended to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis, in which light spots form on developing permanent teeth. However, fluorosis develops with extended use, rather than following a single dose, causing some experts to question this warning (7555, 9100).\n\nEffective June 2022, the total fluoride level permitted in bottled water in the US cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L. This value was chosen based on the optimal level for the prevention of dental caries and risk of dental fluorosis and is consistent with the US Public Health Service recommendation for fluoride addition to community water systems. Previous allowable levels have ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. Fluoride must be declared on the label when added by the manufacturer (107652).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Fluoride is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg daily of elemental fluoride (7555). ...when used topically and appropriately. Fluoride is safe when used in quantities typically found in toothpastes, mouth rinses, and professionally applied fluoride dental treatments (8950, 101102, 101105).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Elemental fluoride is safe when used in doses below the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 0.7 mg for 0-6 months of age, 0.9 mg for 7-12 months of age, 1.3 mg for 1-3 years of age, 2.2 mg for 4-8 years of age, and 10 mg for children 8 years and older (7555). Although infants and children have consumed fluoridated water (typically containing around 0.7 mg/L of fluoride) with apparent safety for many years, some population research has raised concerns about the potential impact of fluoride exposure on neurodevelopment (103551, 115601). However, other observational research has found no correlation (115501, 115600). Higher quality studies are needed. There is some concern that reconstitution of infant formula with fluoridated water might result in fluoride intakes above the UL in infants under 6 months of age, which may be linked to negative cognitive effects (103529). The Canadian Dental Association recommends that when infant formulas are used as the main source of nutrition, drinking water that contains natural fluoride above recommended levels should not be used to reconstitute the formula (103545)....when used topically and appropriately. Fluoride is safe in quantities typically found in toothpastes, mouth rinses, and professionally applied fluoride dental treatments (8950, 9100, 94406, 107648).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses, long-term. Exposure to high doses above the UL for greater than 10 years can cause skeletal fluorosis (7555). To reduce fluoride intake, toothpaste and fluoride rinses should not be routinely swallowed. Recommend limiting the use of toothpaste to a pea-sized amount for children 6 years and younger in case of accidental swallowing (9100). When infant formulas are used as the main source of nutrition, drinking water that contains natural fluoride above recommended levels should not be used to reconstitute the formula (103545). Children living in regions with naturally elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water may be exposed to high doses of fluoride. Some observational research suggests that exposure to drinking water with fluoride levels above 2.5 mg/L is associated with higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels (114884). Other observational research suggests that exposure to drinking water with fluoride levels of over 1 mg/L may be associated with lower IQ scores, a risk that appears to increase with each additional 1 mg/L (114849). These levels generally exceed the recommended level of fluoride in artificially fluoridated drinking water (0.7-1.2 mg/L).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Elemental fluoride is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg daily (7555). Although fluoridated water has been consumed during pregnancy with apparent safety for many years, some population research suggests that more information is needed to determine a safe level of fluoride exposure for those living in regions with fluoridated water. Some emerging population research suggests that increased urinary fluoride levels during pregnancy might be associated with negative cognitive effects in the infant (103543, 103547). However, more information is needed to determine if these results are clinically significant at the population level, as well as whether these effects are due to fluoride or to confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, use of formula instead of breast-feeding, lifestyle factors present during pregnancy, other regional environmental exposures, or the choice of IQ tests used in studies (103542, 103544, 103546, 103547, 103548, 103549, 103550). ...when used topically and appropriately. Fluoride is safe in quantities typically found in toothpastes, mouth rinses, and professionally applied fluoride dental treatments (8950).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally at doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg daily of elemental fluoride for prolonged periods. Long-term exposure to high doses can cause skeletal fluorosis, but pregnancy or lactation doesn't seem to affect susceptibility to skeletal fluorosis (7555).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, fluoride seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nTopically: Stained teeth.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Allergic reactions, including atopic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, gastrointestinal allergic reactions, inflamed lips, respiratory allergic reactions, stomatitis, and urticaria.\nCardiovascular\nA meta-analysis shows that exposure to drinking water high in fluoride is associated with increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and possibly an increased risk of developing hypertension, when compared with exposure to drinking water with low to normal levels. High levels of fluoride were defined as 1.02-4.06 mg/L and low to normal levels were defined as 0.18-0.84 mg/L (107650).\nless\nDental\nFluoride can cause enamel fluorosis, a condition in which the ingestion of excessive amounts of fluoride during the development of permanent teeth may cause discoloration and pitting. This is a cosmetic effect only; tooth enamel may be stronger and more resistant to caries with enamel fluorosis (7555). Topically, use of stannous fluoride in toothpaste has caused staining of the teeth (94409).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome in vitro and observational research has raised concerns regarding the impact of increased fluoride intake on thyroid function (115603). The available observational research, which has taken place in multiple countries with highly variable water fluoride concentrations, has yielded conflicting findings. Some of these conflicting findings may relate to the use of urinary fluoride levels to estimate fluoride exposure. These levels can be significantly altered by various factors, including individual variability in fluoride pharmacokinetics; lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption; and intermittently elevated intake from fluoride-containing dental products or high fluoride foods. Additionally, some population research has identified a potential interaction between iodine intake and fluoride intake on thyroid function, with higher iodine intake increasing the risk for goiter (114885) and iodine deficiency increasing the risk for elevated levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (114889).\n\nA 2023 meta-analysis of the available observational research evaluating fluoride intake and thyroid function identified 33 studies involving 45,000 subjects, the majority of which included children between the ages of 6 to 18. Only 6 of the included studies were considered to be at low risk for bias and only about half of the studies evaluated baseline iodine status. These studies were conducted in Asia (25 studies), Europe (3 studies), Africa (3 studies), and Canada (2 studies). The fluoride levels in drinking water for the regions included in these studies ranged from 0.8 mg/L to 25.1 mg/L; the recommended level of fluoride in U.S. drinking water is 0.7 mg/L. These studies found that water fluoride levels were directly correlated to TSH levels in adults and children; however, this correlation only occurred at water fluoride levels of 2.5 mg/L or more. There were no consistent correlations between thyroid hormone levels (including T3 and T4) and water fluoride levels, or between urinary fluoride levels and any markers of thyroid function (114884).\n\nThe impact of fluoride intake on thyroid function during pregnancy is uncertain. One case-control study of 1105 pregnant adults in Canada found that each 0.5 mg/L increase in water fluoride concentration was associated with 1.65 higher odds of primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy. However, water fluoride levels were not associated with risk of subclinical hypothyroidism. Additionally, urinary fluoride levels and estimated fluoride intake were not associated with changes in TSH. It is important to note that 74% of the cases of primary hypothyroidism reported in this study were present prior to pregnancy and study enrollment, confounding any potential association between pregnancy, fluoride intake, and TSH levels (114886).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, fluoride can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (94405). Enteric-coated and sustained-release dosage forms of sodium phosphate and sodium monofluorophosphate may cause fewer adverse effects than plain sodium fluoride (9127, 9129). Adverse effects appear to be dose related. Sodium fluoride at high daily doses of 40-65 mg can cause nausea, vomiting, and GI bleeding (15, 9127).\nless\nImmunologic\nExposure to fluoride can cause allergic reactions including urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, stomatitis, and gastrointestinal allergic reactions. Respiratory allergic reactions occur rarely (15, 94408). A case of dermatitis around the mouth was thought to be related to the high fluoride levels in a specific toothpaste (NeutraFluor 5000 Plus) (94408). In another case report, lip inflammation occurred in reaction to the amine fluoride in a toothpaste product (94404). Lip inflammation and urticaria were also reported in reaction to a specific brand of toothpaste (Crest Pro-Health). However, it is not clear if this reaction occurred in response to the fluoride or tin component of stannous fluoride (94403).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, sodium fluoride 40-65 mg daily can cause lower extremity pain and stress fractures (15, 9127, 94405). Fluoride at high doses for prolonged periods, over 10 mg daily for 10 or more years, can cause skeletal fluorosis. Skeletal fluorosis initially presents as joint stiffness and pain, followed by crippling, osteosclerosis, muscle wasting, and neurological defects due to hyper calcification of the vertebra. Crippling skeletal fluorosis is extremely rare in the US (7555).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nSome observational research has found that exposure to high levels of fluoride in utero or during childhood may impact neurodevelopment. These findings are currently exploratory; further research is warranted to determine the presence or absence of a causal relationship and whether any risk is significant at the population level (103548, 103549, 103550). In addition, although efforts were made to take confounding factors into consideration during the conduct of these studies, more information is needed to determine whether any neurological effects may be related to other exposures during pregnancy or childhood or to other factors such as socioeconomic status, use of formula instead of breast-feeding, lifestyle factors, or the choice of IQ tests used. Also, the actual intake of fluoride is not known in most cases (94401, 103542, 103544, 103546, 103547, 103548, 103549, 103550, 115606).\n\nPopulation research that has compared IQ scores between geographic regions with high natural levels of fluoride (e.g. up to 11.5 mg/L) and those with artificially fluoridated water (e.g., concentrations between 0.7-1.2 mg/L) have found that much higher fluoride levels may be associated with a reduced IQ score (94401, 103544). A meta-analysis of 30 observational studies including 12,263 children from 7 countries suggests that higher early childhood or prenatal fluoride exposure levels are associated with lower IQ scores. Dose-response analysis indicated a linear decrease in IQ score as water fluoride levels exceeded 1 mg/L, with a 3-point decrement in score for each 1 mg/L increase in water fluoride concentration. However, all but 3 studies were conducted in countries with naturally fluoridated water as opposed to those with artificial water fluoridation programs, within which water fluoride concentrations are monitored and controlled. Additionally, most studies were cross-sectional and heavily confounded, with no information on actual fluoride intake. Furthermore, the relationship between fluoride exposure and IQ score was strongest in the studies determined to be at the highest risk for bias (114849). A subsequent meta-analysis, incorporating many of the same publications in its dose-response analysis, similarly identified an inverse association between IQ score and fluoride exposure when water fluoride levels exceeded 1.5 mg/L (115607).\n\nResearch on the impact of optimally fluoridated water on neurodevelopment during infancy or childhood is conflicting. A meta-analysis of eight cross-sectional and cohort studies which evaluated the impact of fluoride levels at or below 1.5 mg/L in China, India, and Iran found no association with childhood IQ scores and fluoride exposure (115604). Two cohort studies in Australia, where water fluoridation programs are common, have found no correlation between childhood fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment. One study found no difference in behavior scores at 17 years of age between children exposed to fluoridated water during the first 5 years of life and those not exposed to fluoridated water (115600). The second study, which utilized the presence of dental fluorosis as a marker for high childhood fluoride intake, found no difference in IQ score at 16-26 years of age between those with and without dental fluorosis (115501). A cohort study using the Canadian Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) cohort found an association between IQ score at 4 years and fluoride exposure during infancy, but not early childhood, in males, but not females. However, measures of fluoride intake during infancy were limited by lack of data on use of formula versus breastfeeding and the type of water used to reconstitute formula (115601). Separately, one observational study in Canada found a relationship between urinary fluoride levels and diagnosis of ADHD with higher inattention scores at age 14 years, but not at age 9 years (103551). The findings of this study are limited by the use of urinary fluoride levels, which are considered a potentially unreliable marker for fluoride intake.\n\nThere is some concern that reconstitution of infant formula with fluoridated water might result in fluoride intakes above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). One observational study in Canada found that for each 0.5-gram increase in fluoride from reconstituted formula, there is an 8.8-point decrement in performance IQ, which measures non-verbal reasoning and visual-motor coordination, at 3-4 years of age. However, there was no association with global intellectual functioning or verbal reasoning (103529). The Canadian Dental Association recommends that when infant formulas are used as the main source of nutrition, drinking water that contains natural fluoride above recommended levels should not be used to reconstitute the formula (103545).\n\nThere is also some concern that levels of fluoride found in optimally fluoridated water sources might impact fetal neurodevelopment. Emerging population research suggests that increased fluoride intake during pregnancy, as measured by urinary fluoride or dietary surveys, might be associated with negative cognitive effects. One cohort study utilizing data from the Canadian MIREC cohort found that for each 1 mg/L increase in maternal urinary fluoride, there is a 3.7-point decrement in IQ in children aged 3-4 years, with a greater reduction in non-verbal abilities than verbal abilities. A sub-analysis revealed a decrement of 4.5 points in males, with no decrement in females (103543, 103547). A separate MIREC cohort study identified a potential modulating interaction between iodine exposure and fluoride exposure during pregnancy, as determined via urinary levels. Specifically, low iodine-high fluoride was associated with a greater reduction in IQ score than adequate iodine-high fluoride (115608). A cohort study in Mexico found that higher urinary fluoride levels during pregnancy are associated with symptoms of inattention in the offspring at age 6-12 years (103550). Conversely, a cohort study conducted in Denmark identified no relationship between maternal urinary fluoride levels and IQ score at 7 years of age (115602). The findings of these studies are limited by the use of urinary fluoride levels, which are considered a potentially unreliable marker of fluoride intake. In fact, one study investigating the impact of diet on urinary fluoride levels during pregnancy identified potential variations in impact between trimesters and between the pre- and postpartum states (115609).\nless\nOther\nPopulation research in adolescents has found that having plasma fluoride levels of at least 0.32 micromol/L or consuming water with fluoride levels of at least 0.73 mg/L increases the odds of hyperuricemia by approximately 1.8-fold when compared with the lowest quartiles. In addition, serum uric acid levels are increased by 0.212 mg/dL for each micromol/L increase in plasma fluoride levels (107645).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nDental caries. Fluoride can reduce dental caries in primary and secondary teeth when used appropriately in toothpastes providing at least 1000 ppm fluoride, when used in other dental products, or when added to drinking water. It is unclear if oral fluoride supplements are beneficial for caries prevention.\nFluoride added to drinking water and fluoride in toothpastes, mouthwashes, gels, and other dental products can reduce dental caries in secondary, or permanent, teeth (7555, 8950, 9128, 94406, 94407, 101102, 101105, 107647, 114882). A meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials including adults and children aged 6 years and older shows that high fluoride toothpastes, providing at least 2500 ppm fluoride, reduce the odds of dental caries by an additional 47% when compared with standard toothpastes providing up to 1500 ppm fluoride (7555, 8950, 9128, 94402, 94406, 94407, 101102, 101105). Also, the application of fluoride gel, most commonly 12,300 ppm fluoride, at least once per year for up to 4 years reduces the rate of dental caries by 28% on average in children aged 2-15 years (94406). Population research has found that intake of fluoride from food and beverages is greater in adolescents with no lesions when compared with those with at least one lesion of any severity (107649). The regular use of fluoride mouthwash for 1-2 minutes per 5-10 mL application reduces the rate of dental caries by 27% on average. These mouthwashes usually contains fluoride 230 ppm when used weekly or 900 ppm when used daily (94407). Fluoride supplements might also be beneficial for prevention of caries in permanent teeth, although the available clinical research is of moderate quality. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children 6 years of age and older shows that the use of fluoride supplements, such as drops, tablets, and lozenges, usually providing 0.1 mg daily, is associated with a 24% reduction in decayed, missing, or filled surfaces when compared with no fluoride supplementation. It is unclear if fluoride supplementation would provide additional benefit in children already using fluoride toothpaste on a regular basis (94410).\n\nFluoride in toothpastes, varnishes, gels, and other dental products can also reduce dental caries in primary, or deciduous, teeth (94402, 94406, 101105, 107639, 107647, 107648, 114882). Meta-analyses of the available clinical research in mainly preschool-aged children shows that using standard fluoride toothpastes containing 1000-1500 ppm fluoride reduces the risk of dental caries in primary teeth (94402, 101105). In one analysis, the reduction was 31% when compared with no intervention. The effect of toothpastes containing lower quantities of fluoride could not be evaluated from the existing literature (94402). A small number of studies have shown that the use of fluoride gels at least once per year reduces the risk of dental caries in primary teeth by 20% (94406). Another study shows that using sodium fluoride in a varnish in combination with a silver nitrate solution every 6 months reduces dental caries in young children (107639). It is unclear whether professionally applied varnishes have beneficial effects on caries in young children when used alongside regular fluoride toothpastes. One meta-analysis in children using regular fluoride toothpastes daily shows that use of a professionally applied fluoride varnish every 6 months does not have additive effects on caries reduction (107647). However, a more recent clinical trial shows that the use of either an ammonium fluoride or sodium fluoride varnish every 3 months reduces dental caries in young children brushing their teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice daily (107648). The children in these studies had supervised daily brushing, which might not reflect daily life. The effect of fluoride supplements on primary teeth is unclear; the existing clinical research is limited and conflicting, possibly due to the different populations studied (94410).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDental plaque. Topical fluoride seems to reduce dental plaque when used appropriately in toothpastes.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that manual brushing with toothpaste containing stannous fluoride is as effective as toothpaste containing triclosan for reducing the amount of plaque (94409). Furthermore, clinical research shows that amine fluoride/stannous chloride-containing toothpaste, stannous fluoride 0.454% toothpaste, zinc/arginine sodium fluoride toothpaste, and monofluorophosphate toothpaste twice daily for 12 or 24 weeks all reduce dental plaque when compared with baseline in individuals with gingivitis. However, the amine fluoride/stannous chloride- and stannous fluoride-containing toothpastes were more effective than monofluorophosphate or zinc/arginine sodium fluoride toothpastes (101103, 101106, 107646). Manual toothbrushing, usually 1-2 minutes twice per day, with a toothpaste containing stannous fluoride 0.454%, sodium monofluorophosphate, or amine fluoride/stannous chloride has been used (94409, 101103).\nless\nGingivitis. Topical fluoride seems to reduce gingivitis when used appropriately in toothpastes.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that manual brushing with toothpaste containing stannous fluoride is as effective as toothpaste containing triclosan for improving symptoms of gingivitis, including gingival bleeding (94409). Furthermore, clinical research shows that amine fluoride/stannous chloride-containing toothpaste, stannous fluoride 0.454% toothpaste, zinc/arginine sodium fluoride toothpaste, and monofluorophosphate toothpaste twice daily for 12 or 24 weeks all reduce gingivitis and gingival bleeding when compared with baseline in individuals with gingivitis (101103, 101106, 107646). However, the amine fluoride/stannous chloride- and stannous fluoride-containing toothpastes seem to be slightly more effective than monofluorophosphate or zinc/arginine sodium fluoride toothpastes (101103, 101106).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral fluoride seems to be beneficial for improving bone density in patients with osteoporosis. However, it is unclear if oral fluoride prevents fractures.\nElemental fluoride taken daily, continuously, or cyclically, might increase bone mineral density. Monofluorophosphate containing 20 mg elemental fluoride taken daily on a continuous basis for 96 weeks by postmenopausal adults with osteopenia appears to increase spinal bone mineral density (BMD) by 2.4%. In combination with hormone replacement therapy, monofluorophosphate may increase spinal BMD by 11.8% (9125). However, lower doses do not seem to be effective. Doses of fluoride 2.5-10 mg daily for 12 months did not improve BMD in the lumbar spine, hip, or forearm of these patients (94405). In postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis, taking monofluorophosphate containing 20 mg elemental fluoride daily for 4 years seems to increase spinal BMD by 10% (9124). In males with osteoporosis, taking monofluorophosphate containing 15 mg elemental fluoride daily on a cyclical basis (three months on, one month off) for 3 years seems to increase spinal BMD by 3% per year (8948).\n\nThe effect of fluoride on fractures is less clear. Sustained-release sodium fluoride 25 mg daily (equivalent to 11.3 mg elemental fluoride) given cyclically for 12 months on, followed by 2 months off, for 42 months seems to reduce the risk for vertebral fracture by 32% in postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis (9103). Monofluorophosphate appears to reduce the risk of vertebral fracture from 10% in individuals taking only calcium to 2.4% in those taking fluoride plus calcium (9124). In males with osteoporosis, fluoride treatment seems to reduce the risk of vertebral fracture by 30% and also to reduce back pain (8948). However, other studies have found no effect on fractures (9132, 9133). Studies have generally been small and have used various fluoride preparations including sodium fluoride, enteric-coated sodium fluoride, sustained-release sodium fluoride, and sodium monofluorophosphate (8948, 8949, 9103, 9124, 9125, 9129, 9132, 9133).\n\nSome researchers suggest that starting fluoride early in the course of osteoporosis and treating with 20 mg daily along with calcium 800-1000 mg daily for at least 3 years is necessary for efficacy (9162). However, due to the narrow therapeutic index for fluoride dosing to avoid decreased bone mineralization, other experts do not consider fluoride to be a viable treatment option (94405).\n\nThere have been concerns that exposure to fluoridated water might increase the risk of hip fracture in some populations. Overall, the evidence from population research does not support an increased risk (94411). In fact, some studies suggest that long-term exposure of 20 years or more to fluoridated water is associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture. In older females, the reduction in risk of hip fracture and vertebral fracture was 31% and 27%, respectively (9102).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral fluoride is beneficial for improving bone density in patients with Crohn disease.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that fluoride might increase vertebral bone mass in patients with Crohn disease who have low bone mass. Slow-release sodium fluoride 25 mg three times daily for one year, in conjunction with calcium 500 mg twice daily and vitamin D 1,000 IU daily, has been used (9134).\nless\nDental hypersensitivity. It is unclear if topical fluoride is beneficial for reducing dental hypersensitivity.\nA clinical study in healthy older adults with dental hypersensitivity shows that applying silver diamine fluoride 38% solution to the exposed root surface of hypersensitive teeth once every 4 weeks for 8 weeks reduces hypersensitivity on the exposed root surface by 60%, compared with a reduction of 50% with potassium nitrate standard therapy (114883). Interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo control.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral fluoride is beneficial for improving bone density in patients with RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking sodium fluoride 40 mg daily for 18 months might increase vertebral bone mass in patients with RA who have low bone mass (9130).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate fluoride for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are calculated based on total fluoride intake, including fluoridated water. The DRI for fluoride in adults is as follows: 3 mg daily for females 18 years of age and older, including during pregnancy and lactation; 3 mg daily for males 18 years of age; 4 mg daily for males 19 years of age and older (7555). Other doses have been used in clinical research. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nFoods rich in calcium, including infant formula, can form insoluble compounds and decrease the bioavailability of fluoride by up to 25% (7555, 9161).\nTopical:\nFluoride is provided in toothpaste, mouthwash, gel, varnish, and other dental products. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are calculated based on total fluoride intake, including fluoridated water. The DRI for fluoride in children is as follows: 0.01 mg daily in 0-6 months of age, 0.5 mg daily in 7-12 months of age, 0.7 mg daily in 1-3 years of age, 1 mg daily in 4-8 years of age, 2 mg daily in 9-13 years of age, 3 mg daily in 14-17 years of age.\n\nIn the US, most municipal water sources are fluoridated to a concentration of 0.7 to 1.2 parts per million (ppm) (8950). To prevent dental caries in areas where the fluoride ion level in drinking water is less than 0.3 ppm (such as in well water), fluoride supplementation should be provided at the following doses: 0.25 mg daily in those 0.5-3 years of age, 0.5 mg daily in those 3-6 years of age, or 1 mg daily in those 6-16 years of age. For children living in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is 0.3-0.6 ppm, fluoride supplementation should be provided at the following doses: 0.25 mg daily in those 3-6 years of age or 0.5 mg daily in those 6-16 years of age. No supplementation is needed in areas where the fluoride in drinking water exceeds 0.6 ppm (9101).\nTopical:\nDental caries: Fluoride is provided in toothpaste, mouthwash, gel, varnish, and other dental products. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSodium fluoride contains 45% elemental fluoride. Monofluorophosphate contains 19% elemental fluoride (8948, 8949).\n\nStudies using oral fluoride preparations for adults have included sodium fluoride, enteric-coated sodium fluoride, sustained-release sodium fluoride, and sodium monofluorophosphate (8948, 8949, 9103, 9124, 9125, 9129, 9132, 9133).\n\nMouthwashes or rinses containing fluoride usually contain sodium fluoride 0.05% or less for daily or twice daily use. Other types of fluoride include acidulated phosphate fluoride, stannous fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, amine fluoride, and ammonium fluoride (94407).\n\nToothpastes or dentifrices containing fluoride have used stannous fluoride 0.454% (Colgate Total; Mentadent P, Church & Dwight Co. Inc. or Crest Pro-Health or Crest Gum Care; The Procter & Gamble Co. or Sensodyne Complete Protection) (94409, 101103).",

A meta-analysis of observational studies conducted in China found that consuming drinking water with elevated levels of iodine (at least 150 ug/L) and fluoride (at least 1.2 mg/L) was associated with an 11.7-fold increased risk for dental fluorosis and a 4.7-fold increased risk for thyroid goiter when compared with lower levels. The individual impact of iodine versus fluoride intake on these outcomes is unclear (114885). Additionally, an observational study conducted in Canada has found that moderate to severe iodine deficiency may increase the risk for elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in adults with higher fluoride intake, as determined by urinary fluoride levels (114889).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nHigh daily doses of sodium fluoride (40-65 mg) can cause nausea, vomiting, and GI bleeding, as well as lower extremity pain and stress fractures (15, 9127, 94405). Fluoride at high doses for prolonged periods, over 10 mg daily for 10 or more years, can cause skeletal fluorosis (7555). In one case report, a 70-year-old female developed skeletal fluorosis as a result of drinking untreated fluoride-containing well water (107651). Skeletal fluorosis initially presents as joint stiffness and pain, followed by crippling, osteosclerosis, muscle wasting, and neurological defects due to hyper calcification of the vertebra. Crippling skeletal fluorosis is extremely rare in the US (7555).\n\nExposure to very high levels of natural fluoride during childhood is associated with decreased IQ scores. This relationship has been shown in numerous population studies comparing areas with water containing high levels of natural fluoride (e.g. up to 11.5 mg/L) to areas with the standard concentrations of fluoride (0.7-1.2 mg/L) normally found in fluoridated water (94401, 103544).\n\nAcute overdose with fluoride can cause serious adverse effects. In one case report, a 21-year-old female developed hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and tachycardia and subsequently died following intentional intake of 226 grams of a 99.9% sodium fluoride powder as part of a suicide attempt (101104). In another case report, chronic inhalation of chlorofluorocarbon gas from a plastic bag caused subacute fluoride toxicity, resulting in periostitis deformans and calcium in the soft tissue (94400).\nTreatment\nThere is limited reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with fluoride.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFluoride combines reversibly with hydrogen to form hydrogen fluoride, which allows for absorption of fluoride from the stomach (7555). Up to 80% of ingested fluoride, from food, water, toothpaste, or other products, is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (7555).\nDistribution\nFluoride combines reversibly with hydrogen to form hydrogen fluoride, which allows for distribution of fluoride between extra- and intracellular-fluid compartments (7555). Fluoride has a high affinity for calcium and is found in calcified tissue (7555). Fluoride consumption increases fluoride levels in breast milk (94392).\nExcretion\nFluoride combines reversibly with hydrogen to form hydrogen fluoride, which is renally eliminated (7555). Elimination of fluoride from the body is almost entirely via the kidneys with a variable degree of tubular resorption, depending on urinary pH (7555).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine. Fluorine is a halogen and the most electronegative of the elements on the periodic table (7555). Most fluoride in the diet comes from fluoridated water, beverages, and dental products, but some foods and beverages such as marine fish and tea contain significant amounts of fluorine (7555).\nBone effects\nFluoride has a high affinity for calcium; more than 99% of calcium in the body is in calcified tissue. Unlike most other drugs used for osteoporosis, which prevent bone resorption, fluoride stimulates osteoblast activity. Fluoride has been used on and off again for over 30 years as a treatment for osteoporosis. Although fluoride increases bone mineral density (BMD), there is a corresponding decrease in elasticity and strength of bone. Fluoride is also thought to alter the crystalline structure of bone (9129).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that fluoride can inhibit the calcification of soft tissues, including the aorta. This suggests that adequate fluoridation of the water supply might reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease, but more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis (7555).\nDental effects\nFluoride exerts a cariostatic (decay preventing) effect on the teeth by interfering with metabolism of bacteria in dental plaque and preserving tooth enamel. The fluoride concentration in plaque is dependent on exposure to fluoride concentrations in water, beverages, foods, and dental products, as well as the frequency of their use. Plaque is affected by topical exposure to fluoride, as well as to fluoride secreted in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid after oral ingestion. Fluoride protects dental enamel by inhibiting bacterial enzymes that produce acid in plaque. It also reduces acid solubility of enamel, promotes remineralization of early enamel lesions, and prevents demineralization of plaque (7555)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of fly agaric mushroom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of fly agaric mushroom is the fruiting body. Constituents of interest include the isoxazoles ibotenic acid, muscimol, muscasone, and traces of muscarine (18, 96059). The levels of chemical compounds vary between mushrooms and are partially dependent on the season. Levels of ibotenic acid and muscimol are up to 10 times higher during the spring and summer. Ibotenic acid levels are also highest in fresh mushrooms. During the drying process, this constituent is decarboxylated to muscimol (96059).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, the fly agaric mushroom constituent muscimol has anti-inflammatory effects, resulting in decreased levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta. Similarly, in vitro, muscimol reduces intracellular signaling following an inflammatory trigger resulting in decreased production of these cytokines. Various anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of muscimol have been suggested, including free radical scavenging properties, GABA-A receptor activation, acetylcholine release, and/or neuroendocrine system modulation (112892).\nCentral nervous system effects\nOrally, fly agaric mushroom results in mind-altering effects, which can include misinterpretation of sensory stimuli that is similar to the effects of hallucinogens. The isoxazoles ibotenic acid, muscimol, muscazone, and muscarine play a role in these effects (18). Ibotenic acid, at levels less than found in some single fly agaric mushrooms, activates NMDA receptors and is considered to be a neurotoxin. Muscimol blocks the GABA-B receptor, resulting in psychoactivation. Muscasone and muscarine have parasympathomimetic properties (96059)."

    "Folic Acid": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Folate and folic acid are forms of the water-soluble B9 vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in foods such as leafy vegetables, legumes, and fruits. Folic acid, the synthetic form, is frequently formulated in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations (3022, 91313). In 1998, the US government required folic acid fortification of all cold cereals and baking flour, which extends to pastas, bakery items, etc. (6241).\n\nIn the US, foods containing at least 60 mcg of folic acid are allowed to be labeled with a health claim stating that \"women who consume healthful diets with adequate folate may reduce their risk of having a child with birth defects of the brain or spinal cord\" (102369).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally or parenterally and appropriately. Folic acid has been safely used in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for folic acid is based only on supplemental folic acid and is expressed in mcg folic acid. Dietary folate is not included in UL calculations, as dietary folate consumption has not been associated with adverse effects. The UL for folic acid in adults is 1000 mcg (6241). In cases of megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency or malabsorption disorders such as sprue, oral doses of 1-5 mg per day can also be used safely until hematologic recovery is documented, as long as vitamin B12 levels are routinely measured (6241, 7725, 8739).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), the reduced form of folate, is used orally and appropriately, short-term. L-5-MTHF has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 416 mcg daily for 16 weeks (104913, 104914) and a dose of 113 mcg daily for 24 weeks (104920). A specific L-5-MTHF product (Metafolin, Eprova) has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 1.3 mg daily for 12 weeks (104912).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large doses, long-term. Clinical research shows that taking folic acid daily in doses of 800 mcg to 1200 mcg for 3-10 years significantly increases the risk of developing cancer and adverse cardiovascular effects compared to placebo (12150, 13482, 16822, 17041). Doses above 1 mg per day should also be avoided if possible to prevent precipitation or exacerbation of neuropathy related to vitamin B12 deficiency (6241, 6242, 6245). However, there is contradictory evidence suggesting that higher doses may not be harmful. There is some evidence that doses of 5 mg per day orally for up to 4 months can be used safely if vitamin B12 levels are routinely measured (7725). Also, other clinical research suggests that folic acid supplementation at doses up to 5 mg, usually in combination with vitamin B12, does not increase the risk of cancer when taken for 2-7 years (91312). Very high doses of 15 mg per day can cause significant central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal side effects (505).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Folic acid has been safely used in children in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs for folic acid are based only on supplemental folic acid and are expressed in mcg folic acid. Dietary folate is not included in UL calculations, as dietary folate consumption has not been associated with adverse effects. The UL for children is: 1-3 years of age, 300 mcg; 4-8 years of age, 400 mcg; 9-13 years of age, 600 mcg; 14-18 years of age, 800 mcg (6241).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), the reduced form of folate, is used orally and appropriately. One clinical study in infants aged 27 days and younger shows that consuming a formula containing L-5-MTHF (Metafolin, Merck & Cie) 10.4 mcg/100 mL daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks (104918).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Folic acid 300-400 mcg is commonly used during pregnancy for prevention of neural tube defects (8739). Miscarriage rates and negative impacts on fetal growth have not been shown to increase with peri-conception supplemental folic acid intakes of 4 mg per day (91320, 91322). However, other research shows that taking more than 5 mg per day during pregnancy may reduce development of cognitive, emotional, and motor skills in infants (91318). Also, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of folic acid for pregnant or lactating women is 800 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those 19 years and older (6241).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), the reduced form of folate, is used orally and appropriately, short-term. L-5-MTHF has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 416 mcg daily for 16 weeks during lactation. Compared to folic acid, this form seems to further increase the folate concentration of red blood cells, but not breast milk (104913, 104914).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, folic acid is generally well-tolerated in amounts found in fortified foods, as well as in supplemental doses of less than 1 mg daily.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: At doses of 5 mg daily - abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and rash. At doses of 15 mg daily - bitter taste, confusion, hyperactivity, impaired judgment, irritability, nausea, sleep disturbances.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Cancer (long-term use), cardiovascular complications, liver injury, seizures.\n\nAll ROAs: Allergic reactions such as bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock.\nCardiovascular\nThere is some concern that high oral doses of folic acid might increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Clinical research shows that taking doses of 800 mcg to 1.2 mg/day might increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease (12150, 13482). High doses of folic acid might promote cell growth by providing large amounts of the biochemical precursors needed for cell replication. Overgrowth of cells in the vascular wall might increase the risk of occlusion (12150). Although some research suggests that use of folic acid might increase the need for coronary revascularization, analysis of multiple studies suggests that taking folic acid up to 5 mg/day for up to 24 months does not appear to affect coronary revascularization risk (90798).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, folic acid 1-5 mg daily can cause rash (7225, 90375, 91319). Folic acid 15 mg daily can sometimes cause allergic skin reactions (15).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, folic acid 5 mg daily can cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea (7225). Folic acid 15 mg daily can sometimes cause nausea, abdominal distention, flatulence, and bitter taste in the mouth (15). In children aged 6-30 months at risk of malnourishment, taking a nutritional supplement (Nutriset Ltd) enriched in folic acid 75-150 mcg daily, with or without vitamin B 12 0.9-1.8 mcg daily, for 6 months increases the likelihood of having persistent diarrhea (90391).\nless\nHepatic\nLiver dysfunction, with jaundice and very high liver enzymes, occurred in a 30-year-old pregnant patient with severe nausea and vomiting taking a folic acid supplement (Folic acid, Nature Made) 400 mcg daily. Based on the timing of ingestion, the lack of other etiological factors, a positive drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, and liver function normalization once the folic acid had been stopped, the authors suggest the folic acid supplement was the cause. However, the authors did not determine which substance in the folic acid supplement was responsible and therefore it cannot be determined that folic acid itself was the cause (91309).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, folic acid 15 mg daily can sometimes cause altered sleep patterns, vivid dreaming, irritability, excitability, hyperactivity, confusion, and impaired judgment (15). Large doses of folic acid can also precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in people deficient in vitamin B12 (6243). Use of folic acid for undiagnosed anemia has masked the symptoms of pernicious anemia, resulting in lack of treatment and eventual neurological damage (15). Patients should be warned not to self-treat suspected anemia. There is also some concern that consuming high amounts of folic acid from the diet and/or supplements might worsen cognitive decline in older people. A large-scale study suggests that people over 65 years of age, who consume large amounts of folic acid (median of 742 mcg/day), have cognitive decline at a rate twice as fast as those consuming smaller amounts (median of 186 mcg/day). It's not known if this is directly attributable to folic acid. It is theorized that it could be due to folic acid masking a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with cognitive decline (13068). More evidence is needed to determine the significance of this finding. For now, suggest that most patients aim for the recommended folic acid intake of 400 mcg/day.\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that high dose folic acid might increase the risk of cancer, although research is unclear and conflicting. A large-scale population study suggests that taking a multivitamin more than 7 times per week with a separate folic acid supplement significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer (15607). Clinical research also shows that taking folic acid 1 mg daily increase the absolute risk of prostate cancer by 6.4% over a 10-year period when compared with placebo. However, those with a higher baseline dietary intake of folic acid had a lower rate of prostate cancer, but this was not statistically significant. Also, folate and folic acid intake in patients with prostate cancer is not associated with the risk of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy (91317). However, it is possible that discrepancies are due to dietary folate versus folic acid intake. Large analyses of population studies suggest that while dietary folate/folic acid is not associated with prostate cancer, high blood folate/folic acid increases the risk of prostate cancer (50411, 91316).\n\nAdditional clinical research shows that taking folic acid 800 mcg daily, in combination with vitamin B12 400 mcg, significantly increases the risk of developing cancer, especially lung cancer, and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease (17041). However, this may be due to vitamin B12, as other observational research found that higher vitamin B12 levels are linked with an increased risk for lung cancer (102383). Meta-analyses of large supplementation trials of folic acid at levels between 0.5-2.5 mg daily also suggest an increased risk of cancer (50497, 110318). Also, in elderly individuals, taking folic acid 400 mcg daily with vitamin B12 500 mcg daily increased the risk of cancer. The risk was highest in individuals over 80 years of age and in females and mainly involved gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers (90393).\n\nNot all researchers suspect that high intake of folic acid supplements might be harmful. Some research suggests that increased dietary intake of folic acid, along with other nutrients, might be protective against cancer (16822). A meta-analysis of multiple clinical trials suggests that folic acid supplementation studies with folic acid levels between 500 mcg to 50 mg/day does not increase the risk of general or site-specific cancer for up to 7 years (91312, 91321). Also, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of results from clinical research in adults with a history of recent stroke or ischemic attack suggests that taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 does not increase cancer risk overall, although it was associated with an increased risk of cancer in patients who also had diabetes (90378).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, folic acid 15 mg daily can sometimes cause exacerbation of seizure frequency and psychotic behavior (15).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nFolic acid use in late pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of persistent and childhood asthma at 3.5 years in population research (50380). When taken pre-pregnancy or early in pregnancy, population research has not found an association with increased risk of asthma or allergies in childhood (90799, 103979). Folic acid use in pregnancy has been associated with a slightly increased risk of wheeze and lower respiratory tract infections up to 18 months of age in population research (50328).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nFolate deficiency. Oral or intravenous folic acid is effective for the prevention or treatment of folate deficiency.\nAdministering folic acid orally or parenterally improves and prevents folate deficiency (505, 8739). Clinical research shows that supplementation with folic acid 100 mcg to 5 mg daily during pregnancy decreases the risk of developing megaloblastic anemia by up to 79% (91307).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Oral folic acid, taken alone or in combination with other B vitamins, lowers homocysteine levels in most patients. However, it is unclear if this has cardiovascular benefits.\nTaking folic acid orally 0.4-5 mg daily lowers fasting homocysteine levels by 20% to 30% in people with normal to moderately elevated homocysteine levels at baseline. Folic acid 0.8-1 mg daily seems to provide maximal reduction (9307, 9400, 9401, 9405, 9408, 11337, 11338, 50145). Doses above 1 mg daily do not seem to add benefit (9307), except in some people with certain gene mutations that cause homocysteine levels of 20 µmol/L or higher (9408). The higher the initial homocysteine levels, the lower the folic acid dose needed to attain maximum homocysteine reduction (9307). The effects of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine concentrations appear to be greater in females than males (50145). Adding vitamin B6 25-250 mg or vitamin B12 500 mcg seems to further reduce homocysteine levels (1489, 9400, 9405, 9406, 9408, 107136). Some experts recommend routine use of vitamin B12 in homocysteine-lowering regimens to avoid the risk of neuropathy in people with undetected vitamin B12 deficiency (9405).\n\nIncreasing folic acid intake with supplements or folate-fortified cereal products is more effective for reducing homocysteine levels than increasing intake of folate-rich foods (6367). Fortification of cereals and flour with 140 mcg folic acid per 100 grams reduces the mean homocysteine level in the general population by about 7% (7881, 9404, 9407).\n\nElevated homocysteine levels are considered by some to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis progression, recurrent thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and other vascular complications (3886, 3887, 6236, 7725, 9314, 9318, 50509). However, elevated homocysteine levels may be a marker, as opposed to a cause, of vascular disease (11387, 11388). Although folic acid lowers homocysteine levels, it is not yet known whether this reduces the risk of vascular disease. One meta-analysis shows that taking folic acid can reduce the risk of stroke by about 10% in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD); the reduction is greatest in patients for whom homocysteine levels are lowered by at least 25% (96157). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials, including over 44,000 patients at risk for or with a history of CVD, shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo (97619). Also, a meta-analysis in patients with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation, including folic acid, reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and the risk of vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo (107136). However other research does not agree. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that folic acid does not prevent CVD or coronary heart disease, in spite of lowering homocysteine by up to 55%, when individuals with normal or high levels of homocysteine are considered (50539, 96147, 97619). Furthermore, most research shows that folic acid supplementation, alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, does not improve endothelial function or improve secondary prevention of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction in people with existing CVD despite a homocysteine-lowering effect (9313, 11337, 11387, 13482, 50437, 97619). Some research even suggests an increase in CVD risk concurrent with homocysteine lowering (13482). Large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings.\n\nSome researchers hypothesize that different genetic profiles might explain some of these conflicting results. For instance, individuals with a homozygous 677TT MTHFR genotype typically have increased homocysteine levels. However, a meta-analysis suggests that treatment with folic acid does not reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease despite reducing homocysteine levels in individuals with 677TT MTHFR (50456). It has also been theorized that a reduced form of folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) might work better in these individuals. Although [6RS]-5-MTHF has been shown to lower homocysteine levels (104915), studies assessing its cardiovascular benefits are lacking.\nless\nKidney failure. Taking folic acid orally reduces homocysteine levels in people with kidney failure who are on hemodialysis.\nOver 85% of people with kidney failure have hyperhomocysteinemia. Treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in kidney failure is often more difficult than with normal kidney function (1489, 3324, 7289, 9413, 9414, 9416). The reasons for this are not fully understood; renal uptake and metabolism of homocysteine may be reduced in severe kidney failure, and hemodialysis may contribute to vitamin deficiencies (6884, 9414, 9417). Folic acid 0.8-15 mg daily or 3 times weekly is generally used, but the degree of homocysteine reduction varies between 12% to 50%, and normal homocysteine levels (less than 12 µmol/L) cannot always be achieved. Adding vitamin B12 400-1000 mcg daily and vitamin B6 20-50 mg daily produces an additional reduction in homocysteine (1489, 6884, 7289, 7881, 9322, 9413, 9414, 9415, 9416, 9417). Folic acid doses greater than 15 mg daily do not seem to provide additional benefit. Also, doses of 30-60 mg might cause a rebound in homocysteine levels when treatment is stopped (9219). Despite the homocysteine-lowering effect of folic acid in kidney failure, the most robust meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials suggests that folic acid supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (50527). A smaller meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials that used a different primary composite outcome suggests that folic acid might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 15% when compared with control (91311).\n\nThere has also been interest in using a reduced form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF). One study in patients on hemodialysis suggests that taking L-5-MTHF 17 mg daily for 12 weeks might lower homocysteine levels to a greater extent than an equimolar 15 mg of folic acid (104908). Another clinical trial in patients on hemodialysis suggests that giving intravenous L-5-MTHF 50 mg three times weekly is associated with an increased survival of about 36 months, compared with about 26 months with folic acid 5 mg daily. There was no difference in homocysteine reduction between groups (104909). These results should be interpreted with caution because they have not been replicated, and there was no placebo control. Furthermore, survival may have been affected by the availability of kidney transplants.\nless\nMethotrexate toxicity. Oral folic acid reduces the severity of methotrexate toxicity.\nOral folic acid reduces methotrexate toxicity symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis (768, 2162, 2163, 2164, 4492, 4493, 4494, 9369, 9419). Folic acid also seems to reduce methotrexate-induced hepatic side effects by approximately 36% (50320). Some research shows that a low, 0.8 mg weekly dose of folic acid is equally effective to a higher dose of 5 mg weekly for the prevention of methotrexate toxicity (102388).\nless\nNeural tube birth defects. Oral folic acid helps to prevent neural tube birth defects in newborns.\nClinical practice guidelines recommend that anyone capable of becoming pregnant take folic acid 400 mcg daily from fortified foods or supplements to prevent neural tube birth defects in infants. Folic acid 600 mcg daily is advised during pregnancy (94811, 96146). This recommendation is based on research showing that a higher intake of folic acid from food and supplements during pregnancy reduces the primary incidence of neural tube birth defects by 41% to 69% (3325, 9309, 50344, 50403, 50468, 95156). Individuals with a history of children with neural tube birth defects usually take a higher dose of folic acid 4000 mcg daily starting one month before and continuing for up to 3 months after conception (96146). Evidence shows that, when used for secondary prevention, folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects by 66% to 87% (21235, 50263, 50344, 50403, 95156). In the US, foods containing at least 60 mcg of folic acid can be labeled with a health claim stating that healthful diets with adequate folic acid intake may reduce the risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord defect (102369).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive impairment. Taking folic acid alone, with other B vitamins or with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), might improve thinking and memory skills in older patients with cognitive impairment.\nOne clinical trial in patients aged 65 years and older with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) shows that taking folic acid 400 mcg daily for 2 years increases IQ scores when compared with placebo (100952). Two small, low-quality clinical studies in patients aged 70-90 years with cognitive impairment and low folate levels or folate deficiency shows that taking folic acid 5 or 15 mg daily for up to 63 days improves cognitive function, including measures such as memory and attention, when compared with placebo or baseline (50301, 104911).\n\nFolic acid also appears to be beneficial when used in combination with other B vitamins or with DHA. A clinical trial in patients aged 70 years and older with MCI shows that taking folic acid 800 mcg, vitamin B6 20 mg, and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily for 2 years mitigates decline in executive function and, in patients with high baseline homocysteine levels, improves cognition and memory when compared with placebo (50480). Taking folic acid 800 mcg with or without DHA 800 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves cognition, as measured on the full-scale intelligence quotient, when compared with placebo (103978, 109196). However, this benefit is no longer present at 6 months after treatment discontinuation (109196).\nless\nDepression. Oral folic acid seems to modestly reduce depression severity when added to conventional antidepressant therapy. It is unclear if folic acid can reduce the prevalence of depression or the risk for suicide.\nObservational studies suggest that depression is correlated with low folate status, particularly in females (50105, 50127, 50243). Taking folic acid 0.2-15 mg daily for up to 6 months with conventional antidepressants seems to improve treatment response in patients with major depressive disorder (3657, 10884, 10887, 50566, 109190). One meta-analysis shows that taking L-methylfolate or folic acid as an adjunct to treatment with conventional antidepressants modestly reduces depression severity when compared with placebo and conventional antidepressants. The response and remission rates were improved by 36% and 39%, respectively (109190). However, limited clinical research suggests that folic acid is not effective as a replacement for conventional antidepressant therapy (10886). Also, a small clinical study in adolescents at high familial risk for mood disorders suggests that taking folic acid 2.5 mg daily for up to 36 months does not prevent mood disorders when compared with placebo. However, in the patients that were eventually diagnosed with depression, the time of onset was delayed from 5 months to 15.5 months in the group using folic acid when compared with placebo (91313). Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that folic acid is not currently recommended as monotherapy treatment for unipolar depression (110318).\n\nObservational research has also evaluated the association between folic acid supplementation and suicidal events in patients with or without depression. One within-person cohort study, in which only 12% of patients were diagnosed with depression, has found that filling a folic acid prescription of 0.4-5 mg daily, either alone or as part of a multivitamin, is associated with a reduced risk for suicidal events during the following months when compared with months without a prescription (109201). It is unclear what percentage of these patients, if any, had folate deficiency at baseline.\nless\nHypertension. Oral folic acid seems to modestly reduce hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking folic acid 5-10 mg daily for at least 6 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by 2mmHg and improves flow-mediated dilation by 1.6% in hypertensive individuals (50364). Some research has evaluated folic acid in hypertensive patients when used with antihypertensive drugs. Results show that taking folic acid 400-800 mcg in combination with enalapril 10 mg daily for about 4.5 years does not improve blood pressure when compared with enalapril alone (50302, 96158). However, in hypertensive patients with heavy proteinuria, this combination seems to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by about 41% when compared with enalapril alone (96158).\nless\nPhenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia. Topical folic acid seems to reduce gingival hyperplasia due to phenytoin. The effect of oral folic acid is unclear.\nApplying folic acid topically seems to inhibit gingival hyperplasia secondary to phenytoin therapy (2151). However, taking folic acid orally does not seem to improve gingival hyperplasia secondary to phenytoin therapy in adults (2150, 2151, 2152), although some evidence suggests that taking folic acid 500 mcg daily reduces the risk of phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia by 33% in children when compared with placebo (50463).\nless\nStroke. Although some clinical research has shown that oral folate reduces stroke risk by a small amount, more research is needed to determine who is most likely to benefit. Most individual clinical trials show that folic acid seems to reduce stroke risk only in regions without food-fortification policies.\nMultiple clinical studies have shown that folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of stroke by 10% to 25% in regions WITHOUT established policies mandating folic acid fortification of grain products (50240, 50485, 50525, 50539, 91325, 96154, 96157, 96159, 97308). The effect appears to be greatest when folic acid is taken in low doses (usually 0.8 mg daily or lower) (50525, 96157, 96159), in regions with a low prevalence of statin use (50525, 96159), in patients with high cholesterol levels at baseline (96152), in patients who achieve homocysteine reduction of at least 20% (50407, 96157), and in patients with the lowest folate levels at baseline (96154, 96157). There is also some evidence that the effect of folic acid on stroke risk is greatest in patients with low baseline levels of vitamin B12 (96159). In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368).\n\nMost research shows that folic acid supplementation does not reduce the risk of stroke in regions WITH established policies mandating folic acid fortification (50240, 50485, 50525, 50539, 96157, 96159, 97308). However, there is some evidence that folic acid may reduce the risk of stroke in patients from regions with folic acid fortification who have recently had a stroke or transient ischemic attack and are not using antiplatelet drugs (90379).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical research have been conducted. However, possible confounding due to the presence or absence of folic acid fortification is unclear. A meta-analysis of the available research in adults with existing CVD shows that folic acid supplementation at a daily dose of less than 2 mg reduces the risk for stroke by about 10% (102386). Also, a meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials, including over 44,000 patients at risk for or with a history of CVD, shows that B vitamin supplementation, including folic acid, reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo (97619). In patients with a history of stroke, a meta-analysis shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and the risk of vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo (107136).\n\nIt is unclear if folic acid reduces the stroke risk in patients with impaired kidney function. Some research shows that taking folic acid in combination with high doses of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) does not reduce the risk of stroke in these patients (11387, 96150). However, there is concern that the lack of benefit may have been due to the decline in kidney function from high doses of cyanocobalamin (96150). Additional research is needed to determine if folic acid supplementation is beneficial in patients with impaired kidney function when used with other forms of vitamin B12 such as methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin.\nless\nVitiligo. Oral folic acid seems to improve vitiligo symptoms.\nTaking folic acid orally seems to improve symptoms of vitiligo (2153, 2154). This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of observational research which shows that patients with vitiligo have higher serum homocysteine levels when compared with patients without vitiligo (100951).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral folic acid does not seem to prevent cognitive decline in healthy elderly adults.\nMost clinical research shows that taking folic acid, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, does not improve cognitive function, including memory, language, or executive function, in elderly adults with age-related cognitive decline (50318, 50412, 50510). In fact, a large-scale observational study in the US has found that people over 65 years of age who consume large amounts of folic acid (median of 742 mcg daily) have cognitive decline at a rate twice as fast as those consuming smaller amounts (median of 186 mcg daily) (13068).\n\nWhile most research on folic acid for age-related cognitive decline lacks positive findings, many of the studies are small, short-term (<1 year), underpowered to detect significant differences, and not specific to patients with high homocysteine levels. Population research has found that high homocysteine levels are associated with decreased cognition in older adults, suggesting that using folic acid to lower homocysteine levels might mitigate cognitive decline in these patients (50094). Two long-term clinical trials examining the effects of folic acid in elderly adults with high homocysteine levels show mixed results. A large-scale clinical trial of patients aged 50-70 years from the Netherlands who have high homocysteine levels shows that taking folic acid 800 mcg daily for 3 years increases memory, information processing, and other measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo (15271). However, another large-scale clinical trial of patients aged 65 years and older from the Netherlands who have high homocysteine levels shows that taking folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily for 2 years lowers homocysteine levels, but does not appear to improve overall measures of cognitive function, when compared with placebo (90392). The reasons for the discrepant findings in these two studies are not clear but might relate to differences in the dose of folic acid, duration of treatment, and age of patients included.\nless\nAnemia. Adding oral folic acid to oral iron therapy does not seem to improve hematologic parameters in patients with anemia.\nIn postpartum patients with anemia, clinical research shows that taking iron as ferrous fumarate 600 mg and folic acid 1 mg daily is no more effective than iron alone for improving hemoglobin status (91319). Also, clinical research in non-pregnant menstruating females shows that taking folic acid 0.4 mg daily or 2.8 mg once weekly for 16 weeks with iron 60 mg daily does not reduce anemia or improve iron status when compared with iron alone (109193). During pregnancy, clinical research shows that folic acid supplementation does not decrease the risk of pre-delivery anemia or low hemoglobin levels (91307).\nless\nCataracts. Oral folic acid does not seem to reduce cataract development.\nClinical research in females with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with risk factors for CVD shows that taking folic acid 2.5 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for an average of 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of developing cataracts. Furthermore, the risk of cataract extraction was increased by 28% in these patients (96149).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral folic acid does not seem to reduce the risk of diarrhea, and might even increase the incidence of diarrhea in children.\nIn children aged 6-30 months at risk of malnourishment, clinical research shows that taking a nutritional supplement (Nutriset Ltd) enriched in folic acid 75-150 mcg, with or without vitamin B12 0.9-1.8 mcg, daily for 6 months does not reduce the incidence of diarrhea when compared with placebo. Enrichment with folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, actually seems to increase the likelihood of having more episodes of both persistent diarrhea and diarrhea lasting over 3 days (90391).\nless\nFall prevention. Oral folic acid does not seem to reduce the risk of falls.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily, for 2 years, does not prevent falls when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D (96148).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem prevent mortality in premature infants.\nClinical research shows that supplementation with folic acid during pregnancy does not decrease the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death (91307, 96156).\nless\nLeukemia. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce the risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nA meta-analysis of results from two case-control studies has found that increased folate intake during pregnancy is not associated with a reduced risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (50247).\nless\nMale infertility. Oral folic acid does not seem to improve sperm parameters or pregnancy rates in males with infertility.\nSome small clinical studies show that taking folic acid, alone or with zinc, increases sperm count in males with idiopathic infertility or in males with a grade III varicocele (9334, 90194). However, another small study in males with asthenozoospermia shows that taking folic acid 5 mg, selenium 200 mcg, and vitamin E 400 IU daily for 3 months does not improve sperm parameters when compared with placebo (104907). Furthermore, there seems to be no improvement in clinical outcomes. One large, high-quality clinical study in males with idiopathic infertility shows that taking folic acid 5 mg with zinc 30 mg daily for 6 months does not improve sperm morphology, pregnancy rate, or live birth rate when compared with placebo (102085).\n\nFolic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A retrospective study in males with or without varicocele-related infertility suggests that taking a specific combination product containing folic acid 0.2 mg, vitamin C, zinc, L-carnitine fumarate, acetyl-L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, selenium, and vitamin B12 (Proxeed Plus, Sigma-Tau) twice daily for 6 months is associated with improvements in sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility when compared to baseline. Improvement in semen parameters were greatest in subjects with more severe varicoceles (111296). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral folic acid does not seem to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.\nClinical research in elderly adults or adults with a history of cerebrovascular disease shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg and folic acid 0.4-2 mg, with or without vitamin B6 25 mg, daily for 2-3 years does not seem to reduce the risk for osteoporotic fractures when compared with placebo (90377, 90393). A 5-7 year follow-up of this research has also found no benefit (103981).\nless\nPhysical performance. Oral folic acid does not seem to improve physical performance in older adults.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily for 2 years, does not improve hand strength or improve performance such as walking when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D (96148).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral folic acid does not seem to prevent pre-eclampsia in pregnant patients.\nWhile the effect of low-dose prenatal folic acid is unclear, high-dose folic acid does not seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. Some population research has found that low-dose folic acid is associated with a 22% reduced odds of pre-eclampsia, while other research has found no association (91308, 99370, 99372, 110447). A large clinical trial evaluating high-dose folic acid in pregnancies at risk for pre-eclampsia shows that taking 4 mg daily, starting at 8-16 weeks of gestation and continuing until delivery, does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo (103929). A secondary analysis of this study in twin pregnancies has also found no benefit with high-dose folic acid supplementation (103977).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Oral folic acid does not seem to prevent respiratory tract infections.\nClinical research in children aged 6-30 months at risk of malnourishment shows that taking a nutritional supplement (Nutriset Ltd) enriched in folic acid 75-150 mcg, with or without vitamin B12 0.9-1.8 mcg, daily for 6 months does not reduce the incidence of lower respiratory infections when compared with a supplement not enriched with folic acid and vitamin B12 (90391).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nColorectal adenoma. Oral folic acid does not prevent colorectal adenomas.\nAlthough some population research and one clinical study has found that high folate intake is associated with reduced colorectal adenoma risk (2142, 2143, 91303), most clinical research does not support this finding. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 2.5 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for up to 9.2 years, does not reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma in females at high risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with placebo (90389). Other clinical research suggests that taking folic acid does not reduce the occurrence or recurrence of adenomas or incidence of advanced adenomas (34596, 50241, 50265, 50369, 50394, 50449, 50522). Furthermore, treatment with folic acid for more than 3 years seems to be associated with an increased risk of advanced adenomatous lesions (50378).\nless\nFragile X syndrome. Oral folic acid does not improve symptoms in children with fragile X syndrome.\nClinical research shows that taking folic acid orally does not improve symptoms of fragile X syndrome (2155, 2156, 2157, 2158, 2159, 2160, 50575).\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral folic acid does not seem to reduce the risk of preterm birth.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that supplementation with folic acid 200 mcg to 5 mg during pregnancy does not decrease the risk of preterm birth (91307, 96155). An observational study in patients with and without epilepsy found that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower odds of preterm birth in patients receiving antiseizure medications; however, no link between folic acid and preterm labor was reported in patients without epilepsy or in those with epilepsy not receiving antiseizure medications (110447).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbdominal wall defects. It is unclear if oral folic acid helps to prevent abdominal wall defects in newborns.\nObservational research in a population in northern China has found that taking folic acid supplements until the end of the first trimester modestly reduces the risk of abdominal wall defects and the risk of omphalocele, specifically, in the newborn when compared with not taking folic acid. However, this association was not found in a population in southern China (109191). These differing outcomes may be related to the lower dietary folate intakes in northern China.\nless\nAcne. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults and children with inflammatory acne shows that taking 1-4 tablets of a specific product (NicAzel, Elorac Inc.) containing folic acid, vitamin B6, nicotinamide, azelaic acid, zinc, and copper for 8 weeks reduces inflammatory lesions and improves appearance in 88% and 81% of patients, respectively, when compared with baseline (90800).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large-scale clinical study shows that taking folic acid 2.5 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily reduces the risk of developing AMD in females over 40 years of age with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with risk factors for CVD. Those who took this combination for an average of 7.3 years had a 34% reduced risk of developing AMD and a 41% reduced risk of visually significant AMD when compared with placebo (14620). It is unclear if this effect is due to folic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. Folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in males with overweight or obesity, mild erectile dysfunction, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing folic acid 400 mcg, alpha-lipoic acid, myo-inositol, and apple (Sinopol Forte) increases testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and measures of erectile dysfunction but not follicle-stimulating hormone or sperm parameters when compared to baseline (111674). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to folic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk of developing this condition.\nLow levels of folate and high levels of homocysteine have been linked to a greater risk of Alzheimer disease (50094). Also, some observational studies have found that higher intake of folate from the diet and supplements in elderly adults is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with lower intake (13165, 15270). One small clinical trial in patients with Alzheimer disease who are taking cholinesterase inhibitors shows that taking folic acid 1 mg daily for 6 months increases the likelihood of treatment response, classified as global improvement in behavioral and/or functional status with no decline in mental status scores, by 78% to 87% when compared with placebo (50246). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease who are not consuming a folate-fortified diet shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily plus folic acid 1.2 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves some measures of cognitive performance and decreases levels of homocysteine when compared with placebo (107150).\n\nHowever, not all research agrees. Clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease using routine medications shows that taking folic acid 5 mg, vitamin B12 1 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg daily for 18 months does not have a beneficial effect on cognitive function or the severity of disease when compared with placebo (50319). However, all patients in this study were also consuming a folate-fortified diet.\nless\nAngioplasty. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome evidence suggests that folic acid 1 mg, vitamin B12 400 mcg, and pyridoxine 10 mg daily can decrease the rate of restenosis in patients treated with balloon angioplasty (8009, 9412). However, this combination does not seem to be as effective for reducing restenosis in patients after coronary stenting (8009). An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mg, vitamin B6 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after bare metal coronary stenting also does not seem to reduce restenosis and might actually increase restenosis (12150, 12151). Due to the lack of evidence of benefit and potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral folic acid during pregnancy reduces the risk of eczema in the child.\nObservational research has found that consuming both iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy is associated with a four-fold reduced risk for developing atopic dermatitis in the child. However, use of either iron or folic acid supplementation alone is not associated with an effect on the child's risk for atopic dermatitis (102387).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral folic acid intake during pregnancy reduces the risk of autism spectrum disorder in the child.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that consumption of folic acid of at least 400 mcg daily from both diet and supplements during pregnancy is associated with a 45% reduced risk of autism in the child at 2-15 years of age. Also, supplementation with folic acid during the prenatal to early period of pregnancy is associated with an approximate 43% reduced risk of autism in the child. This association did not differ between countries with or without a folate fortification program (109198). An individual population study has also found that prenatal folic acid supplementation initiated the first day of the last menstrual period before conception is associated with a 39% reduced odds of autism in the child at age 3.3-10.2 years when compared to pregnancies without folic acid supplementation (91324).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. There is limited evidence on the oral use of folic acid for beta-thalassemia minor.\nPatients with beta-thalassemia minor may experience decreased muscle strength and increased bone or muscle pain. A small clinical study in children with this condition shows that taking folic acid 1 mg, with or without L-carnitine 50 mg/kg, daily for 3 months reduces bone pain by 64% to 84% and increases the number of stairs climbed by 2- to 5-fold when compared with baseline (90631). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if adding oral folic acid to conventional bipolar therapy further improves symptoms.\nSome clinical evidence suggests that folic acid does not improve the antidepressant effects of lithium in patients with bipolar disorder (50566). However, other clinical evidence suggests that taking folic acid in combination with valproate during the acute phase of mania improves the effects of valproate (50357).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces breast cancer risk.\nSome older population research suggests that increased intake or levels of folic acid alone does not affect the risk of breast cancer or breast cancer-related mortality (50218, 50224). However, in a specific group of women who also consume high amounts of dietary methionine, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), or pyridoxine (vitamin B6), dietary intake of folate is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (9328, 50224). Also, more recent population research has found that folic acid plus folate dietary intakes between 153-400 mcg are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. This risk is further reduced in those who drink relatively large amounts of alcohol (90794). Folate intakes greater than 400 mcg daily do not appear to be protective against breast cancer (90794).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid prevents cancer.\nA large cohort study of children born to mothers with epilepsy on antiseizure medications suggests that prenatal folic acid exposure of 1 mg daily or more, at an average of 4.3 mg daily, is associated with a 2.7-fold greater risk of pediatric cancer when compared with children born to mothers with epilepsy but without prenatal exposure to high-dose folic acid. Additionally, this risk is not present in children of mothers without epilepsy taking high-dose folate (112103). It is unclear how maternal epilepsy, antiseizure medications, and folate interact to increase the risk of pediatric cancers. However, in the absence of clear guidelines, mothers with epilepsy should take no more than 4 mg of folic acid daily (112101, 112102).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although oral folic acid does not seem to prevent most CVD events, some research suggests that increased dietary folic acid might lower the risk of stroke and CVD-related mortality in patients at high risk for CVD.\nIn 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368). Meta-analyses of available research show that folic acid might lower the risk of stroke in patients with CVD (97619, 102386, 107136). Some clinical research shows that taking folic acid reduces the risk of CVD by 15% in patients with kidney failure or chronic kidney disease (50444, 91311). However, most research shows that folic acid supplementation, alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, does not improve endothelial function or reduce the risk of death or CVD events in patients with existing hyperhomocysteinemia, coronary heart disease, CVD, kidney disease, or prior stroke, despite having a homocysteine-lowering effect (9313, 9322, 11337, 11387, 13482, 50437) (50512, 50527, 96154, 96147, 97619, 102386).\n\nSome population research has evaluated adults at high risk for CVD. This research has found that dietary folate intake of at least 382 mcg daily is associated with a modest reduction in CVD-related mortality and possibly all-cause mortality. Consuming folic acid as a component of fortified food in doses of more than 251 mcg daily is associated with a modest reduction in CVD-related mortality. Conversely, folic acid supplementation is associated with a higher risk of CVD and overall mortality, and there is a J-shaped association between folate intake, serum folate levels, and red blood cell folate levels, with both CVD-related and all-cause mortality (109199).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid prevents cervical cancer.\nEpidemiological evidence has found that increasing folate intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin B12, might decrease the risk of precancerous cervical lesions (11074).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral folic acid supplementation during pregnancy improves child development.\nClinical research in Northern Ireland shows that taking folic acid 400 mcg daily starting in the 14th week of gestation and continuing until the end of pregnancy improves word reasoning in the child at 7 years of age when compared with placebo. When compared with a historical cohort from Britain, folic acid supplementation was associated with an increase in full scale IQ, verbal IQ, performance IQ, and general language at 7 years of age (102385). At age 11, benefits in word reasoning were no longer significant. However, there were modest benefits in some measures of processing speed when compared with placebo. Verbal comprehension was modestly improved in females, but not males (109192). Observational research in pregnant individuals and their children in Spain has found that taking less than 400 mcg of folic acid daily during pregnancy is associated with lower mental alertness scores in children at ages 7-9 years when compared with folic acid 400-999 mcg daily, while taking folic acid 1000 mcg or more daily during pregnancy was associated with improvements in some measures of working memory in the children. However, no relationship between folic acid dosing and most other measures of cognitive function was identified (110449).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral or injectable folic acid for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of folic acid for this condition.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). While adding oral folic acid to enalapril might slow CKD progression, adding folic acid to high-dose vitamin B12 does not seem to be beneficial.\nClinical research in adults with hypertension and CKD shows that taking enalapril with folic acid 800 mcg for a median of 4.4 years reduces the risk of worsening kidney function by 21% and slows the rate of kidney function decline by 44% when compared with enalapril alone (96153). However, clinical research does not support the use of folic acid in patients with CKD when used in combination with high-dose vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). Vitamin B12 might increase the risk of negative outcomes (50253, 50409, 96150). More research is needed to determine the benefits of folic acid when used alone.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid prevents colorectal cancer.\nAlthough the majority of population research suggests that taking folic acid orally from dietary and supplemental sources reduces the risk of colorectal cancer (505, 2140, 2144, 2145, 2250, 6271, 9325, 9326, 50109, 50427, 50450)(91306, 91323, 96160, 109188, 110450), clinical evidence in general is not supportive. Most clinical research and meta-analyses of clinical trials suggest that taking folic acid from dietary or supplemental sources does not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (2141, 34596, 50394). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Some observational research suggests that an inverse association between folate intake and risk of colorectal cancer was not apparent until at least 12 years after baseline folate intake was determined (109188). A meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that the benefits of folic acid supplementation on colorectal cancer risk might be limited to patients with moderate to high alcohol consumption (110450). Other clinical evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of folic acid may be limited to colon, but not rectal, cancer (21501). Furthermore, the beneficial effect for colon cancer may be limited to only certain subtypes. For instance, females with folate intake of at least 400 mcg daily seem to have a 46% reduction in the risk of p53-overexpressing colon cancer, but not p53-negative tumors, when compared with those who consume less than 200 mcg daily (21300). Also, the source of folic acid may influence its effects. Some observational research suggests that dietary folate, but not folic acid supplementation, reduces the risk of colon cancer (21501).\nless\nCongenital heart disease. It is unclear if oral folic acid prevents congenital heart disease.\nThe exact cause of congenital heart disease is unknown but is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Population research has found that supplementation with folic acid or folic acid-containing prenatal vitamins during pregnancy is associated with up to a 40% lower risk of congenital heart defects in newborns (99373).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral folic acid is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of dementia.\nWhile some preliminary research shows that folic acid might aid in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease (13165, 15270, 50246, 90374), two small clinical trials show that taking folic acid 15-20 mg daily for 10-12 weeks does not seem to improve cognitive function or the severity of dementia in patients with various forms of dementia, including vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, probable Alzheimer disease, or dementia due to other causes (50062, 50597).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that oral folic acid does not improve glycemic control.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes show that folic acid does not reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) when compared with placebo (50528, 109197). Another small clinical study in patients with diabetes who are stabilized on metformin and/or a sulfonylurea shows that taking folic acid 5 mg daily for 8 weeks does not affect HbA1C when compared with placebo (104917). The validity of this study is limited by its small size and lack of blinding. Conversely, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking folate modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as measures of insulin resistance, when compared with placebo or no intervention (109197). There was no clear relationship between these changes and the dose or duration of folate. However, the studies included in this analysis evaluated multiple patient populations; the effect of folate in patients with diabetes, specifically, is unclear.\n\nBeyond glycemic control, some research has assessed the impact of dietary folate intake on cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. An observational study in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes has found that dietary intake of folate in the highest quartile is associated with 68% lower odds of developing cardiovascular disease, defined as a non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, when compared with folate intake in the lowest quartile (110452).\n\nFolic acid has also been evaluated in gestational diabetes. A meta-analysis of 20 studies shows that serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels are higher in patients with gestational diabetes than without gestational diabetes. Subgroup analysis suggests that patients with gestational diabetes have higher serum and RBC folate levels in the second trimester than in those without gestational diabetes, while RBC folate levels in patients with gestational diabetes were higher in the first trimester than those without gestational diabetes. Overall, higher serum folate levels are associated with a slight increase in the odds of gestational diabetes when compared with lower serum folate levels (112107).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid (L-methylfolate), vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate), for 24 weeks does not improve neural dysfunction based on vibration perception, but does seem to improve total neuropathy symptoms, when compared with placebo. These symptoms, which include both sensation and pain, decreased by 25% with the B vitamin combination, compared with only 15% in those taking placebo (90375).\nless\nEpilepsy. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces seizure frequency.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that taking folic acid does not reduce seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy (50124). However, there is some speculation that folate deficiency might be linked to increased seizure frequency. A preliminary clinical study in folate-deficient children with epilepsy shows that taking folic acid 5 mg daily for 3 months reduces seizure frequency when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a control group that is not deficient in folate (99371).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in males with mild erectile dysfunction, overweight or obesity, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing folic acid 400 mcg, alpha-lipoic acid, myo-inositol, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared to baseline (111674). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to folic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. Higher dietary folate intake is associated with a lower risk of esophageal cancer.\nOne meta-analysis of observational research has found that higher levels of dietary folate are associated with a 34% lower risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and a 50% lower risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma when compared with low levels of dietary folate (50208). Another meta-analysis of observational research has found that consuming high amounts of folate is associated with a 36% decrease in the odds of esophageal cancer when compared with lower dietary folate intake (100950).\nless\nFenofibrate (Tricor)-induced hyperhomocysteinemia. Folic acid seems to attenuate increases in homocysteine in people taking fenofibrate.\nA small open-label clinical trial in patients taking fenofibrate shows that adding folic acid 10 mg every other day might reduce elevated plasma homocysteine levels by up to 59% when compared with taking fenofibrate alone (9321).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces gastric cancer risk.\nObservational research has found that taking folic acid reduces the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma by 17% and the risk of noncardia gastric cancer by 33%, but does not reduce the risk of gastric cancer overall (50208). Also, a meta-analysis of 13 small clinical studies in patients with gastric precancerous conditions shows that taking folic acid 20-30 mg daily for 3-6 months improves gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia but does not seem to improve symptoms when compared with a control (110448). Whether these findings are associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer is unclear.\nless\nGout. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk for gout.\nAn observational study has found that increased dietary folate intake is associated with a lower incidence of gout (50454).\nless\nHead and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid is beneficial for head and neck cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that the highest intake of dietary folate is associated with a 50% reduced risk of head and neck cancer when compared with the lowest intake of folate. Each 100 mcg increase per day seems to reduce the risk by about 4% (96151).\nless\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral folic acid prevents hearing loss.\nLow levels of serum folate seem to be a risk factor for sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adults (21283). Observational research in females has found that serum folate levels in the lowest quintile are associated with a 19% increased risk for hearing loss when compared with levels in the second quintile. Also, folate levels in the highest quintile are associated with a 12% lower risk of hearing loss when compared with the second quintile (109807). A clinical study in older adults from the Netherlands shows that taking folic acid 800 mcg daily for 3 years slows the decline of age-related low-threshold hearing loss when compared with placebo (15163). However, at the time of this study, folate enrichment of foods was not allowed in the Netherlands. As a result, baseline folate levels in this study population were about 50% lower than in the US population. The effect of folic acid supplementation in people with higher baseline folate levels is unclear.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 is more beneficial than folic acid alone for increasing pregnancy rate in females undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART).\nRetrospective research from Italy suggests that taking 5-MTHF 400 mcg, vitamin B12 5 mcg, and vitamin B6 3 mg daily results in clinical pregnancy and live birth rates of approximately 60% and 49%, respectively, compared with 45% and 35% of those taking folic acid 400 mcg daily. A sub-analysis suggests that beneficial effects on pregnancy rates are limited to individuals aged less than 40 years (109189). The findings from this study are limited by its retrospective design. Also, it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to countries with folate fortification.\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral folic acid is beneficial in patients with kidney failure.\nBecause hemodialysis removes folate from the body, there is concern that folate deficiency may cause complications in patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. Observational research in Taiwanese patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis has found that taking folic acid 5 mg daily for an average of 5.8 years is associated with a 31% lower risk of arteriovenous access thrombosis when compared with folic acid 5 mg weekly. However, daily folic acid supplementation was not linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular events, cancer, or mortality when compared with weekly folic acid (110120).\n\nOral folic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small, low-quality clinical study in adults with kidney failure undergoing regular hemodialysis shows that taking oral folic acid 30 mg daily with thiamine 90 mg daily for 96 weeks reduces overall mortality by 67% and improves cognitive scores by 31% when compared with no intervention (107724). It is unclear if these findings are due to folic acid, thiamine, or the combination.\nless\nLometrexol toxicity. While oral folic acid might reduce lometrexol toxicity, intravenous folic acid does not seem to help.\nIn a phase I trial, intravenous folic acid 5-25 mg administered 1 hour or 3 hours prior to lometrexol 15-30 mg/m2 every 3 weeks does not seem to reduce cumulative lometrexol toxicity (2161). However, in a phase II study, taking oral folic acid 3 mg/m2 daily in addition to lometrexol 10 mg/m2 weekly seems to attenuate cumulative toxicity and improve its tolerability in cancer patients (104948).\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral folic acid supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of a low birth weight.\nClinical research shows that supplementation with folic acid 200 mcg to 5 mg daily during pregnancy increases mean birth weight when compared with placebo (91307). Furthermore, some population research has found that pre- or peri-conception folic acid supplementation, usually 400 mcg daily, is associated with a reduced risk of a child born small-for-gestational age. However post-conception folic acid supplementation is not associated with reduced risk (91304, 103983). An observational study in pregnant Chinese patients found that supplementation with folic acid is associated with a 20% lower odds of low birth weight when compared with no supplementation. This association was observed when folic acid was used both before conception and during pregnancy for at least 24 weeks or during pregnancy only for at least 12 weeks. Increased dietary folate intake was not linked to a lower risk of low-birth-weight infants (110446). However, other observational research has found no association between folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and the risk for small-for-gestational age births (110447).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces lung cancer risk.\nThere does not appear to be a relationship between deficiency of folate and lung cancer (9454). However, consuming at least 130.4 mcg of folate per 1000 kcal daily seems to reduce the risk of lung cancer by 40% in former smokers when compared to those with lower dietary folate intake (50065).\nless\nMelanoma. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces melanoma risk.\nPopulation research has found that folic acid supplementation of 2-2.5 mg daily in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 is linked with a 53% reduced risk of melanoma (91312).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there is interest in using oral folic acid for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of folic acid for this condition.\nNitrate tolerance. It is unclear if oral folic acid helps to prevent the development of tolerance to treatment with nitroglycerin.\nSome clinical evidence suggests that taking folic acid 1 mg daily for 1 week does not prevent the development of nitroglycerin-induced endothelial dysfunction or tolerance in healthy individuals (50442). However, other research suggests that taking folic acid 10 mg daily for 1 week prevents nitric oxide synthase dysfunction caused by continuous nitroglycerin (9316).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral folic acid is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA cross-sectional analysis suggests that adults with NAFLD have lower levels of serum folate and its major component 5-MTHF when compared with healthy controls. Additionally, adults with NAFLD seem to consume less supplementary and dietary folate when compared with healthy controls. Overall, serum folate levels are negatively associated with the risk of NAFLD, and inadequate folate intake is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (112104).\nless\nOral clefts. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk of oral clefts in infants.\nObservational research has found that maternal folic acid supplementation is associated with an up to 49% reduced risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (50220, 104921). Furthermore, a large clinical trial in pregnancies at-risk for oral cleft suggests that taking a higher dose of folic acid 4 mg from pre-conception until the end of the first trimester results in a similar oral cleft recurrence rate of 2.5%, compared with a 2.9% recurrence with a lower dose of folic acid (400 mcg). Both doses demonstrate a lower incidence of oral clefts when compared with historical rates of 6.3% (91322). Although there is speculation that genetic markers of folate status impact the effect of folic acid on orofacial cleft incidence, the current data do not show a relationship (104921).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk of overall mortality.\nObservational research in US adults has found that dietary intake of folic acid in the highest quintile is associated with a 14% to 23% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 41% to 47% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with the lowest quintile of dietary folic acid intake (110451).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces pancreatic cancer risk.\nConsuming greater than 280 mcg daily of dietary folate is associated with a decreased risk of exocrine pancreatic cancer (9327). A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies suggests that consuming higher amounts of dietary folate reduces the risk of pancreatic cancer by 51% compared to low levels of dietary folate (50208). However, another meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies suggests that folate/folic acid intake does not significantly affect the overall risk of pancreatic cancer (50499). The contradictory results may be associated with the form of intake or may be related to the gender of the participants. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that dietary folate, but not folic acid, significantly reduces the risk of pancreatic cancer (50387). Also, one meta-analysis of observational studies has found that high dietary folate decreases the risk of pancreatic cancer in females, but not males (50387).\nless\nPeripheral neuropathy. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows taking a combination of folic acid 400 mcg, vitamin B12 3 mcg, and uridine monophosphate 50 mg daily (Keltican) for 60 days reduces pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. Use of this product reduces pain intensity by approximately 44%, with loss of burning pain in approximately 50% of patients, strong tingling or pricking in approximately 57% of patients, strong pain attacks in 92% of patients, and numbness in 90% of patients when compared with baseline. Radiating pain and the use of concomitant medications are also reduced (90384). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefits are due to folic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces pharyngeal cancer risk.\nPopulation research has found that intake of folic acid and folate from natural, fortified, and supplemented sources, may protect against oropharyngeal cancer. Intake of at least 258-816 mcg total folate/folic acid reduces the odds by 35% when compared with intakes of less than 344 mcg. Furthermore, folate/folic acid may be more beneficial for oral cancer versus pharyngeal cancer and in heavy alcohol users versus non users or light users (91302).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral folic acid is beneficial for PCOS.\nOne clinical study in overweight or obese patients with PCOS shows that taking folate 1 mg or 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces levels of homocysteine, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. However, only the 5 mg dose modestly reduces insulin, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Neither dose appears to affect fasting plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (109200). Other clinical research in patients with PCOS taking metformin shows that taking folate 400 mcg daily for 6 months does not affect glycemic parameters, plasma lipid levels, or hormone levels when compared with placebo (109194). The reasons for discrepancies between studies are unclear but may relate to patient characteristics. One study included only overweight or obese individuals with at least two of the three PCOS criteria, whereas the other study limited enrollment to patients in any weight category but with all three PCOS criteria (109194, 109200).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk of hypertension during pregnancy.\nPopulation research has found that taking folic acid during pregnancy is not associated with a reduced risk of gestational hypertension (91308, 99370, 99372).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). Although there is interest in using oral folic acid for RLS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of folic acid for this condition.\nSchizophrenia. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of folic acid 2 mg and vitamin B12 400 mcg daily for 16 weeks improves negative symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia who have persistent symptoms and a specific genetic variant of the folate transporter gene FOLHI. This variant normally results in reduced folate absorption. However, in patients without this genetic variant, folate is not beneficial with respect to negative symptom improvement (90387).\nless\nSickle cell disease. Oral folic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other B vitamins; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin B12 4.2-6 mcg, folic acid 700 mcg, and vitamin B6 4.2-6 mg daily might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is unknown if this will reduce the risk of endothelial damage in these patients (9324).\nless\nSuicidal ideation. It is unclear if oral folic acid reduces the risk of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.\nOne observational study has evaluated the association between folic acid supplementation and suicidal events in patients with various underlying conditions, including 12% with depression, 15% with anxiety, and 46% with pain. This within-person cohort study found that filling a prescription for folic acid 0.4-5 mg daily, either alone or as part of a multivitamin, is associated with a 44% reduced rate of suicidal events during the months after the prescription when compared with the months without the prescription. For the 48% of patients who received folic acid 1 mg daily, each additional month of taking the prescription was associated with a 5% decrease in suicidal events (109201). Prospective clinical research is needed to confirm any benefits of folic acid and to determine whether baseline folate deficiency plays a role in these outcomes.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate folic acid for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for folate are expressed in Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE). DFEs reflect the difference in bioavailability between supplemental folic acid and folate found in foods. Folic acid is estimated to be 85% bioavailable. Dietary folate, however, is only 50% bioavailable. Thus, 1 mcg DFE is equivalent to 1 mcg dietary folate or 0.6 mcg folic acid.\n\nThe daily RDA for adults is 400 mcg DFE. In pregnancy, the RDA is 600 mcg DFE; in lactation, the RDA is 500 mcg DFE (6243). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nAbsorption of supplemental folic acid is reduced by about 15% when taken with food (6241, 6243). This reduction may not be clinically significant.\nAll other ROAs:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily adequate intakes (AI) for infants are 65 mcg DFE for 0-6 months of age and 80 mcg DFE for 7-12 months of age (6243). The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for folate are: 1-3 years, 150 mcg DFE; 4-8 years, 200 mcg DFE; 9-13 years, 300 mcg DFE; 14-18 years, 400 mcg DFE. For pregnancy, 600 mcg DFE; for lactation, 500 mcg DFE (6243).See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSupplements typically contain synthetic folic acid (96155). However, some products contain reduced folate formulations such as L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), also known as [6S]-5-MTHF (104912, 104913, 104916).",

Additionally, in one case report, taking folic acid 15 mg daily might have contributed to increased toxicity, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, edema, hand-foot syndrome, and eventually death, in a patient prescribed capecitabine (16837).\nless\nMETHOTREXATE (Trexall, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nFolic acid might reduce the efficacy of methotrexate as a cancer treatment when given concurrently.\nMethotrexate exerts its cytotoxic effects by preventing conversion of folic acid to the active form needed by cells. There is some evidence that folic acid supplements reduce the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and theoretically they could reduce its efficacy in the treatment of other cancers (9420). Advise cancer patients to consult their oncologist before using folic acid supplements. In patients treated with long-term, low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriasis, folic acid supplements can reduce the incidence of side effects, without reducing efficacy (768, 2162, 4492, 4493, 4494, 4546, 9369).\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nFolic acid might have antagonistic effects on phenobarbital and increase the risk for seizures.\nFolic acid can have direct convulsant activity in some people, reversing the effects of phenobarbital and worsening seizure control (4427, 9357, 9358). Monitor closely for increased seizure activity.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nFolic acid might reduce serum levels of phenytoin in some patients.\nFolic acid may be a cofactor in phenytoin metabolism (4471). Folic acid, in doses of 1 mg daily or more, can reduce serum levels of phenytoin in some patients (4471, 4477, 4531, 4536). Increases in seizure frequency have been reported. If folic acid supplements are added to established phenytoin therapy, monitor serum phenytoin levels closely. If phenytoin and folic acid are started at the same time and continued together, adverse changes in phenytoin pharmacokinetics are avoided (4471, 4472, 4473, 4531). Note that phenytoin also reduces serum folate levels.\nless\nPRIMIDONE (Mysoline)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nFolic acid might have antagonistic effects on primidone and increase the risk for seizures.\nFolic acid can have direct convulsant activity in some people, reversing the effects of primidone and worsening seizure control (4427, 9357, 9358).

Folic acid doesn't antagonize the effects of pyrimethamine in the treatment of malaria, because malarial parasites cannot use exogenous folic acid. Use folinic acid as an alternative to folic acid when indicated (9380).\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGREEN TEA\nTheoretically, green tea might decrease the activity of folic acid.\nIn vitro, the green tea constituent, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), appears to inhibit the activity of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (15012). Dihydrofolate reductase is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form, tetrahydrofolate. In pregnancy, consuming more than 57 mL green tea per 100 kcal decreases circulating folate levels (91314). Theoretically, green tea could lead to functional folic acid deficiency.\nless\nZINC\nTheoretically, folic acid might reduce the absorption of zinc.\nThere is concern that folic acid might reduce the absorption of zinc. However, evidence on the effects of supplemental folic acid on dietary zinc absorption is conflicting (9389, 9390, 9391, 9392, 9393, 9421). Of note, normal supplemental doses of folic acid are unlikely to have an adverse effect on zinc balance in people with adequate dietary zinc intake (7135, 9391).\nless",

An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mg, vitamin B6 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after coronary stenting might actually increase restenosis rates (12150). Due to the potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151).\nless\nCANCER\nThere is some concern that folic acid might increase the risk of certain cancers. Preliminary clinical research suggests folic acid in doses of 0.8-1 mg daily might increase the risk of cancer, possibly by increasing cell growth. However, other research has shown no effect. Until more is known, avoid folic acid in doses higher than the RDA in people with a history of cancer (12150, 13482, 16822).\nless\nSEIZURE DISORDERS\nHigh supplemental doses of folic acid might exacerbate seizures in people with seizure disorders. Doses less than 1 mg have rarely been associated with increased seizure activity (9901).\nless\nVITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY\nThere is some concern that folic acid can improve hematologic signs of megaloblastic anemia, without resolving the underlying cause, thereby masking vitamin B12 deficiency. This may allow potentially irreversible neurological damage to progress in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency (2677, 3092, 5646, 9411, 20504, 20505).\nless",

For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nAMINOSALICYLIC ACID\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nAminosalicylic acid might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nAminosalicylic acid can reduce dietary folate absorption, worsening folate deficiency often seen with active tuberculosis, or preventing reversal during treatment (9363, 9388, 9395, 9396, 9397). Megaloblastic anemia occurs rarely, and usually with other contributing factors such as concurrent vitamin B12 malabsorption (4559). Advise patients being treated for tuberculosis to take folic acid supplements if their dietary folate intake is low. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nANTACIDS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, antacids might reduce folate absorption; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nFolic acid absorption in the small intestine is optimal at a pH of 5.5-6 (8441). Chronic use of large doses of antacids can reduce folic acid absorption, but this is likely only significant if dietary folate intake is very low (2677, 8441). Advise patients to maintain the recommended daily intake of folic acid in their diet. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nANTIBIOTIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, antibiotics might reduce folate absorption; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nAntibiotic therapy can disrupt the normal gastrointestinal (GI) flora, interfering with enterohepatic recirculation (reabsorption) of folic acid (4436). The normal GI flora also synthesizes and consumes folic acid, which may also be disrupted by antibiotics (2677, 4437, 6243). Folic acid synthesized by GI bacteria can be absorbed in the large intestine, but the amount synthesized and absorbed is variable (4437, 6243). For instance, it can depend on dietary fiber intake and gastric pH; hypochlorhydria causes bacterial overgrowth and increased folate synthesis (4437, 9364). In most people it's unlikely that a course of antibiotics will reduce folic acid levels significantly, and therefore supplements are unnecessary. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nASPIRIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nAspirin might affect folate protein binding and affect folate excretion; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nAspirin may decrease serum folate levels by reducing binding to plasma proteins, especially when large doses are taken regularly (e.g., for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis). But there doesn't seem to be an increase in urinary folate losses and red blood cell levels remain normal (9351, 9360). This suggests folate is being redistributed in the body and deficiency isn't likely. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nCARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCarbamazepine might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nCarbamazepine can reduce serum folate levels, but megaloblastic anemia has not been reported (4426, 4427, 4428, 4429, 9359). Reduced folate levels might contribute to mild, asymptomatic reductions in nerve conduction velocities, and mental changes seen with carbamazepine (4427, 4429). Possible mechanisms include reduced folic acid absorption and increased metabolism by induced hepatic enzymes (4426, 4428, 4429). Pregnant patients taking carbamazepine may be especially at risk from reduced folate levels, as low folate levels during pregnancy may contribute to birth defects and pregnancy loss (9355, 9356). However, folic acid supplements have worsened seizure control in some people with epilepsy (4427). Advise patients taking carbamazepine chronically to consult their physician before starting folic acid supplements.

It can lower serum and red blood cell folate levels in children taking large doses (0.2 to 1.1 grams/kg/day) for several months (4455). There aren't any reports of deficiency in adults. Encourage patients to maintain a good dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nCOLESTIPOL (Colestid)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nColestipol might interfere with folic acid absorption and reduce serum folate levels.\nColestipol can interfere with absorption of folic acid, and reduce serum folate levels (4461). Encourage patients to maintain good dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nCYCLOSERINE (Seromycin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCycloserine might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nCycloserine can reduce serum folate levels; rare cases of megaloblastic anemia have occurred (4531, 4536, 9363). The mechanism is uncertain, but may involve changes to the absorption and metabolism of folate (4531, 4536). Advise patients receiving long-term treatment to maintain a good dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nDiuretics might increase folate excretion; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nLimited data suggests diuretics may increase excretion of folic acid. Reduced red blood cell folate levels, possibly contributing to increased homocysteine levels, were found in one group of people taking diuretics for six months or longer (1898). The need for folic acid supplementation during diuretic therapy hasn't been adequately studied. Advise patients to maintain a good dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nESTROGENS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nEstrogens might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nReduced serum and red blood cell folate levels can occur with the use of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) or oral contraceptives, although this is unlikely with adequate dietary folate intake (4459, 4498, 7843, 7844, 9371, 9373). There are rare reports of megaloblastic anemia associated with oral contraceptive use, usually in patients with other conditions contributing to folate deficiency (9371, 9372). Possible mechanisms by which estrogens contribute to folate deficiency include reduced absorption of dietary folate, increased excretion, induction of liver enzymes, and increased protein binding of folate in serum (4459, 9371). There is some evidence that oral contraceptives can increase the rate of progression of cervical dysplasia to cervical cancer, and that folic acid can slow or reverse this dysplasia (9352, 9370). Advise patients taking oral contraceptives or other estrogens to maintain a good dietary intake of folate. Recommend supplements only for those with inadequate dietary intake or other conditions that contribute to folate deficiency (4459, 9371, 9373), and for those diagnosed with, or at increased risk for, cervical dysplasia. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nH2 BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, H2 blockers might reduce folate absorption; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nFolic acid absorption from the small intestine is optimal at a pH of 5.5-6 (8441). The increased pH associated with use of H2 blockers may therefore reduce folic acid absorption, but this is probably only significant if dietary folate intake is very low (4483, 8441). Advise patients to maintain the recommended daily dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nMETFORMIN (Glucophage)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nMetformin might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nReduced levels of vitamin B12 and, to a lesser extent, folic acid occur in some people with diabetes and can contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia, adding to their already increased risk of cardiovascular disease (32, 4490, 9366, 9367). The reduced folate levels seen in people with diabetes have been linked to metformin use in some cases, possibly as a result of reduced folic acid absorption (32, 9367, 9368). Symptomatic folate deficiency is unlikely to occur with metformin, but people with diabetes may need folic acid supplements to reduce hyperhomocysteinemia (9367). For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nMETHOTREXATE (Trexall, others)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nMethotrexate reduces serum folate levels and increases the risk of folate deficiency.\nMethotrexate is a folate antagonist which prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form, and lowers plasma and red blood cell folate levels (4492, 4493, 4494, 4546). In patients treated with long-term, low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriasis, the development of folate deficiency is associated with increased risk of certain side effects. These include gastrointestinal effects, stomatitis, alopecia, abnormal liver function tests, myelosuppression, megaloblastic anemia, and increased homocysteine levels (768, 4492, 4493, 4494, 4546). Folic acid 0.8-5 mg daily reduces these side effects without reducing the efficacy of methotrexate (768, 2162, 4492, 4493, 4494, 9369, 9418, 102388). Advise patients taking methotrexate for these conditions to take a folic acid supplement, especially if their dietary folate intake is low and they are experiencing the side effects described (4494, 4546, 9369, 9419). It's likely that people who have experienced side effects will need to continue taking folic acid for the duration of methotrexate therapy (9418). Advise patients being treated with methotrexate for cancer to avoid folic acid supplements, unless recommended by their oncologist. Folic acid could interfere with the anticancer effects of methotrexate (9420).\nless\nMETHYLPREDNISOLONE\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nIt is unclear if methylprednisolone can reduce serum folate levels.\nReduced serum folate levels were noted in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) after treatment with methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1 gram daily for 10 days. The clinical significance of this change isn't known (9362). For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nNONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nIt is unclear if NSAIDs can reduce serum folate levels.\nFolate-dependent enzymes are inhibited in vitro by NSAIDs with carboxylic acid-containing side chains (2677, 9361). The clinical significance of this inhibition is unknown. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPANCREATIC ENZYMES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPancreatic enzymes can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nReduced folate levels can occur in some people taking pancreatic enzymes. This may be due to reduced absorption, since folate can form insoluble complexes with pancreatic enzymes (9374). Advise patients to have their folate levels checked if they take pancreatic enzymes for prolonged periods, and to take a supplement if the level is low. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPENTAMIDINE (NebuPent)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPentamidine can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nPentamidine is a weak folate antagonist which prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form, although this isn't thought to contribute significantly to its antiprotozoal activity (9378). Decreased serum folate levels and megaloblastic bone marrow changes can occur rarely with prolonged parenteral pentamidine therapy (9378). Most patients are unlikely to need folic acid supplements. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPhenobarbital can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nIn people with low dietary folate intake, phenobarbital might reduce serum folate levels leading to megaloblastic anemia, and possibly contributing to neurological side effects, mental changes, and cerebral atrophy (4427, 4530, 4536, 9333, 9357, 9358, 9359). Possible mechanisms include reduced folic acid absorption, increased metabolism, increased demand for folic acid as a coenzyme for induced hepatic enzymes, or competitive interaction between folate coenzymes and phenobarbital (9357). Pregnant patients taking phenobarbital may be especially at risk for reduced folate levels, as low folate levels during pregnancy may contribute to birth defects and pregnancy loss (9354, 9355, 9356). Folic acid therapy seems to reverse these neurological effects (9333). However, folic acid can worsen seizure control. Advise patients taking phenobarbital to consult their physician before taking folic acid supplements. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPhenytoin can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nPhenytoin can reduce serum folate levels, occasionally leading to megaloblastic anemia, and possibly contributing to neurological side effects and mental changes (4427, 4536, 9357, 9358, 9359, 107146). Population research has found that taking phenytoin for over two years is associated with a reduction in folate levels and an approximately 6-fold increase in risk for folate deficiency when compared with taking phenytoin for less than one year (107146). Possible mechanisms include reduced folic acid absorption, increased metabolism, increased demand for folic acid as a coenzyme for induced hepatic enzymes, or competitive interaction between folate coenzymes and phenytoin (9357). Folic acid supplements may reduce phenytoin side effects (4471, 4477). Pregnant patients taking phenytoin may be especially at risk from reduced folate levels, as low folate levels during pregnancy may contribute to birth defects and pregnancy loss (9354, 9355, 9356). However, folic acid can reduce phenytoin serum levels and increase seizure frequency. Advise patients taking phenytoin chronically to consult their physician before taking folic acid supplements. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPRIMIDONE (Mysoline)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPrimidone can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nIn people with low dietary folate intake, primidone might further decrease serum folate levels and might lead to megaloblastic anemia, possibly contributing to neurological side effects, mental changes, and cerebral atrophy (4427, 4530, 4536, 9333, 9357, 9358, 9359). Possible mechanisms include reduced folic acid absorption, increased metabolism, or increased demand for folic acid as a coenzyme for induced hepatic enzymes (9357). Pregnant individual taking primidone may be especially at risk for reduced folate levels, as low folate levels during pregnancy may contribute to birth defects and pregnancy loss (9354, 9355, 9356). Folic acid therapy seems to reverse these neurological effects (9333). However, folic acid can worsen seizure control.

For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, PPIs might reduce folate absorption; however, folate deficiency has not been reported.\nFolic acid absorption in the small intestine is optimal at a pH of 5.5-6 (8441). The increased pH associated with use of PPIs could theoretically reduce folic acid absorption (8441), but preliminary data suggests use of PPIs for several years doesn't cause folate deficiency (4483). Advise patients to maintain the recommended dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nPYRIMETHAMINE (Daraprim)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPyrimethamine can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nPyrimethamine is a folate antagonist that prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form (4425, 4532). At high doses, 50-75 mg daily, megaloblastic anemia may occur due to deficiency of active folate, and it's recommended that all patients receive folinic acid (leucovorin calcium, an active form of folic acid) (4532). Folinic acid doesn't antagonize the therapeutic effect of pyrimethamine because Toxoplasma does not have a membrane transport system for exogenous folinic acid (9380). Advise patients to avoid other forms of folic acid since they can antagonize the therapeutic effect of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma and Pneumocystis carinii. Advise patients taking lower doses of pyrimethamine for prolonged periods to maintain the recommended dietary folate intake. Monitor for folate deficiency. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nRETINOIDS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nRetinoids reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nIsotretinoin (Accutane), a retinoid vitamin A derivative, reduces serum levels of folic acid in patients with acne (91305). Advise patients taking isotretinoin to maintain the recommended dietary intake of folic acid. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nSULFASALAZINE (Azulfidine)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nSulfasalazine can reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nSulfasalazine competitively inhibits absorption of folic acid in the intestine (2677, 4515, 4560, 9353). It also interferes with the breakdown of dietary folate to its absorbable form, and can cause hemolysis, which increases folate requirements for formation of new red blood cells (4515, 4560). Long-term sulfasalazine therapy can cause reduced serum and red blood cell folate levels and hyperhomocysteinemia (4515, 9377). Occasionally, megaloblastic anemia develops, usually with high doses of sulfasalazine ( >2 grams/day), and when there are other factors contributing to folate deficiency (4515, 4516, 4517, 4536, 9376, 9377). Reduced folate levels might contribute to the increased risk of colon cancer and colonic mucosal dysplasia seen in people with ulcerative colitis (9379). Advise patients on chronic sulfasalazine therapy to increase their dietary folate intake, and to take a supplement if they have any other condition which could also contribute to deficiency (2677, 9353, 9379). For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nTRIAMTERENE (Dyrenium)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTriamterene might reduce folate absorption and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nTriamterene is a folate antagonist that prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form, and also reduces folate absorption (4425, 4536, 4537, 9375). Reduced serum and red blood cell folate and occasional cases of megaloblastic anemia have occurred, usually in people with other conditions contributing to folate deficiency (4537, 9375). Advise patients on chronic triamterene therapy to maintain the recommended dietary folate intake, or to take a supplement if this is not possible. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nTRIMETHOPRIM (Trimpex)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTrimethoprim might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nTrimethoprim, alone or combined with sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, Bactrim, Septra), inhibits the enzyme involved in the conversion of folic acid to its active form (4468, 4531). The bacterial and protozoal enzymes are 1,000-10,000 times more sensitive to trimethoprim than human enzymes (2677, 4468, 9382). Therefore, while low doses of trimethoprim (10 mg/kg daily) don't seem to reduce folate levels (9381, 9383, 9394), high doses of trimethoprim (20 mg/kg daily for 2-4 weeks or 500 mg daily for several months) might precipitate megaloblastic anemia, especially in those with other risk factors (4468, 9382, 9383, 9384, 9394). If megaloblastic anemia occurs, trimethoprim should be stopped and treatment with folinic acid (an active form of folic acid) should be initiated (9382). There is no consensus on the use of prophylactic folinic acid to prevent megaloblastic anemia with trimethoprim use. The practice may not be effective, especially in people with AIDS in whom immunologic reactions, as well as folate deficiency, probably contribute to hematologic changes (9385, 9386, 9398). There is a general belief that supplements don't interfere with the therapeutic effects of trimethoprim, because infecting organisms can't utilize exogenous folate sources (2677, 9382, 9384). However, this view has been challenged (4468, 9386), and failure of trimethoprim therapy has occurred rarely when folinic acid is given concurrently (9387, 9399). Advise patients taking low doses of trimethoprim (100-200 mg daily) for treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections that they are unlikely to need folate supplements. Advise patients taking high doses of trimethoprim (20 mg/kg daily) to maintain good dietary folate intake, but to avoid folate supplements unless prescribed by their physician. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless\nVALPROATE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nValproate might reduce serum folate levels and increase the risk of folate deficiency.\nValproate may reduce folate levels in some people, but symptomatic deficiency has not been reported (4428, 9356, 9359). Pregnant patients taking valproate may be especially at risk from reduced folate levels, as low folate levels during pregnancy may contribute to birth defects and pregnancy loss (9355, 9356). However, most research suggests that taking folic acid 1-5 mg daily perinatally with valproate does not reduce the rate of fetal malformations (104919). Furthermore, folic acid supplements have worsened seizure control in some people with epilepsy (4427). Advise patients taking valproate chronically to consult their physician before taking folic acid supplements. For information on foods that are rich in folate, see our chart.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with folic acid.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFolate in food is about 20% to 50% less bioavailable than synthetic folic acid, which is almost 100% bioavailable. Before folate from food can be absorbed, the polyglutamate side chain must undergo enzymatic deconjugation in the small intestine to form the absorbable monoglutamate form (6241, 9300, 50227). Folate deconjugation occurs maximally at a pH of 6-7 (6241, 9300). Folate levels in the blood increase approximately 30 minutes following consumption in foods and levels remain elevated for up to 5 hours with no difference in the area under the curve (AUC) for monoglutamyl vs. polyglutamyl folates (50187). The bioavailability of polyglutamyl forms of folic acid appears to be approximately 50% to 78% of monoglutamyl folic acid (50084, 50099, 50217).\n\nSome vitamin manufacturers claim that supplements containing L-methylfolate are better than folic acid-containing supplements. There is some evidence that L-methylfolate is slightly more bioavailable than folic acid. However, with continuing use of the supplements there is no difference in blood levels. Some manufacturers claim that L-methylfolate is a better alternative to folic acid because some people lack the enzymes to convert folic acid to L-methylfolate. But so far, there is no reliable evidence that this makes a meaningful difference. For example, equivalent doses of folic acid and L-methylfolate raise folate levels in pregnant women equally well (17321, 17322, 17323).\n\nThere is also interest in the reduced form of synthetic folate, L-5-methyltetra-hydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), which is dependent on vitamin B12 for metabolism. A single dose of L-5-MTHF seems to result in faster and greater absorption when compared with folic acid, both in those with the homozygous (TT) MTHFR and the wild-type (CC) MTHFR genotypes (104916). During longer supplementation periods of up to 16 weeks, this increased bioavailability seems to be less pronounced but maintained. Two small clinical studies in females show that taking L-5-MTHF (Metafolin, Eprova) 1.3 mg or L-5-MTHF 416 mcg daily for 12-16 weeks resulted in slightly higher folate concentration in red blood cells when compared with taking the molar equivalent of folate 1 mg or 400 mcg daily for 12-16 weeks (104912, 104913).\nDistribution\nIn patients with coronary artery disease, plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate increases proportionately with treatment dose of folic acid, whereas vascular tissue 5-methyltetrahydrofolate does not (50233).\nMetabolism\nAfter folic acid is absorbed, it is reduced to tetrahydrofolate and then enters a methylation cycle (9317). Tetrahydrofolate is then converted to L-methylfolate. In patients with coronary artery disease, plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate increases proportionately with treatment dose of folic acid (50233). However, unmetabolized folic acid is also found in both plasma and breast milk when folic acid is consumed (50327, 50329).\nExcretion\nFolic acid is excreted mainly in the urine; however, it is also found in the feces (50306, 50625, 50657). Folate is also lost during hemodialysis (50002).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFolate is the general term that refers to a variety of chemical forms of folic acid. Folic acid, or pteroylmonoglutamic acid, is the form used in vitamin supplements and fortified foods. Folate in food is pteroylpolyglutamate, which has a polyglutamate side chain with peptide linkages (6241). Foods that are naturally high in folate content with 60% to 90% bioavailability include asparagus, mushrooms, yeast, legumes, leafy vegetables such as spinach, broccoli, and lettuce, fruits such as bananas, melons, oranges, tomatoes, and lemons, and animal proteins such as beef liver and kidney (6241, 8739, 9300, 9518). Folate in food is about 40% to 50% less bioavailable than synthetic folic acid, which is almost 100% bioavailable (6241, 9300). Although some vitamin manufacturers claim that supplements containing L-methylfolate are better than folic acid-containing supplements, with continuing use of the supplements there is no difference in blood levels and there does not appear to be meaningful differences between the two products, including for neural tube defect reduction (17321, 17322, 17323).\nAlzheimer protective effects\nFolic acid might play a role in Alzheimer disease. Preliminary evidence indicates that low folate concentrations might be related to atrophy of the cerebral cortex, particularly in people with neocortical lesions related to Alzheimer disease (6234). Also, homocysteine is thought to be neurotoxic, causing DNA damage and cell apoptosis (9331). Low serum folate levels are strongly correlated with cerebral atrophy on autopsy (6234). Functional and mental deterioration is also sometimes associated with low folate levels and low intake of folate in elderly people (6238, 9330). In patients with Alzheimer disease, folic acid may improve the response to cholinesterase inhibitors by reducing homocysteine levels (50246).\nAnti-depressive effects\nFolic acid deficiency is common among people with depression (10879, 10880, 10881). Low folate levels have been linked to poor response to antidepressant treatment (6239, 10880). In the general population, people with low folate status or lower dietary folate intake have a higher risk for depression (10882, 10883). The exact role of folic acid in depression is unknown. It is required for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and for s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) conversion (5232). Folate is also required for the methylation of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for the hydroxylase enzymes involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (10884, 10885).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlthough some individual clinical trials disagree, most clinical research shows that taking folate reduces levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). A smaller number of studies suggest that folate does not affect levels of interleukin (IL)-6 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (109195).\nCancer effects\nThere is evidence in support of a relationship between folate/folic acid levels and both a prevention and a positive association with cancer. Some researchers suggest that folic acid is thought to prevent carcinogenesis. Folate and methionine are important factors in the methylation of DNA. There is evidence that folate deficiency might cause massive misincorporation of uracil into DNA and increased chromosomal breaks (9325, 9236, 9327, 9328). Low red blood cell folate levels have been associated with the development of dysplasia and cancer in ulcerative colitis (2140). Also, there is some preliminary evidence that increased dietary folate intakes may reduce the risk of some specific cancers (9328, 16822, 50078, 50109, 50208, 50387, 50427, 50450). However, the role of folic acid supplements in the development or prevention of cancer is unclear. There is some concern that high dose folic acid might increase the risk of cancer. Evidence from population research suggests that taking a folic acid supplement or having high blood levels of folate/folic acid might increase the risk of developing prostate cancer (15607, 17041, 50411, 50497, 90393, 91316). Other research suggests that there is no association between folate and folic acid intake and the risk of various types of cancers (50411, 91312, 91316, 91317, 91321). It is possible that discrepancies are due to the different relationship with dietary folate/folic acid intakes vs. blood levels and cancer risk.\nCardiovascular effects\nFolic acid might improve endothelial dysfunction, arterial blood flow, and the coagulation and oxidative status in individuals with high coronary risk and atherosclerotic disease. Improvements in endothelial dysfunction have been shown following an acute myocardial infarction (50509, 50229), as well as in patients without cardiovascular disease (50087, 50410). There is also preliminary evidence folic acid can decrease concentrations of von Willebrand factor, which is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Folic acid might also decrease fibrinogen concentrations, while increasing plasminogen, antithrombin III, glutathione peroxidase, red cell glutathione, and red cell superoxide dismutase concentrations (9319).\n\nLow folate levels are associated with increased plasma homocysteine levels and hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for coronary, cerebral, and peripheral atherosclerosis; recurrent thromboembolism; deep vein thrombosis; myocardial infarction; and ischemic stroke (1899, 3323, 9402, 9405, 9408), However, most analyses of clinical research suggest that folic acid supplementation, alone or in combination with pyridoxine and vitamin B12, does not improve endothelial function or reduce the risk of death or cardiovascular events in people with existing coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or prior stroke despite having a homocysteine-lowering effect (9313, 9322, 11337, 11387, 13482, 50437, 97619) (50512, 50527).\nFetal development effects\nFolic acid also plays an important role in pregnancy. Low folate levels are associated with recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss (6237). Folic acid supplementation also prevents neural tube defects in the fetus, but the exact role of folic acid in this process is not completely understood.\nFolic acid deficiency\nIn humans, tetrahydrofolate-based coenzymes play a major role in intracellular metabolism. Tetrahydrofolate plays an indirect role in the rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis. Abnormalities in this process that occur with folic acid deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid reduces damage to DNA and prevents replication errors (2139, 2144). Folic acid deficiency disturbs cell cycling, induces cell apoptosis, and increases the rate of cell death (9329). In the bone marrow, abnormal cellular maturation and division caused by folic acid deficiency leads to the development of abnormal red blood cell precursors, which are known as megaloblasts. Megaloblasts are unable to mature into red blood cells properly and many of them are phagocytosed by macrophages in the bone marrow, which contributes to the development of megaloblastic anemia (9518).\n\nSome patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) also have decreased folic acid levels (6082, 6083), so some people try folic acid supplements for chronic fatigue.\n\nCrohn's disease (6269) and venous thrombosis (90398) have also been associated with decreased folate levels.\nHomocysteine-lowering effects\nFolic acid is involved in the metabolism of homocysteine. Low folate levels are associated with increased plasma homocysteine levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for coronary, cerebral, and peripheral atherosclerosis; recurrent thromboembolism; deep vein thrombosis; myocardial infarction; and ischemic stroke (1899, 3323, 9402, 9405, 9408). Low serum folate levels (less than 9.9 nmol/L) and low dietary folate intake (less than 211 mcg per day) are also associated with an increased risk for acute coronary events and cardiovascular disease mortality (9311, 9312). A 5 micromole increase in plasma homocysteine increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease by 50%, and the risk of coronary heart disease by 60% in men and 80% women (9407, 9411). The best predictor of response to folic acid therapy is the baseline homocysteine plasma concentration. The higher the homocysteine level, the better the response is to folic acid therapy. Folic acid has little effect on normal homocysteine levels. Genetic variations in the enzyme 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can influence the effectiveness of folate in reducing homocysteine levels (9219). The mechanisms of the adverse effects of homocysteine isn't fully understood, but might include vascular endothelial cell damage, impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide activity, arterial stiffening due to increased oxidation and arterial deposition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased platelet adhesiveness, and activation of the clotting cascade (9310, 9403, 9408).\n\nHomocysteine is metabolized via two pathways; remethylation or trans-sulfuration. Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and vitamin B12 as cofactors (9310, 9320, 9407). The methyl donor is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and the enzymes involved are 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine-methyltransferase, which is vitamin B12-dependent (2148, 9310). Impairment of this pathway leads to increased fasting homocysteine levels, and can occur in people with folate deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or who are homozygous for the mutations of the gene for MTHFR (TT genotype) (1489, 9301, 9315). Mutation of the MTHFR gene produces a variant of the enzyme that is thermolabile, less active, and it impairs the formation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (9301, 9320). Folic acid supplements increase the activity of this pathway, which lowers homocysteine levels (2146, 2148, 3886, 9301). Trans-sulfuration of homocysteine results in degradation to cystathionine and then to cysteine by the pyridoxine (vitamin B6) dependent enzymes cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-synthase (2148, 9310, 9407). This pathway is primarily active after ingesting a methionine load (animal protein). Deficiencies of pyridoxine or cystathionine-beta-synthase impair this pathway, raising post-methionine load homocysteine levels (1489, 2148, 9408). Elevation of these levels is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, independent of elevated fasting homocysteine levels (1489).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in the use of folic acid for improving nerve conduction velocity, a measure of nerve damage and dysfunction. A small clinical study in patients with diabetic neuropathy suggests that taking folic acid 1 mg daily for 16 weeks improves the amplitude of sensory nerve conduction and the amplitude and velocity of motor nerve conduction when compared with placebo, suggesting that folic acid may enhance nerve function in these patients (100949).\nNitrate tolerance effects\nFolic acid might prevent nitroglycerin-induced nitrate tolerance and cross tolerance to endothelial nitric oxide. Nitrate tolerance is associated with an increased vascular production of superoxide anions by NADPH oxidase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Folic acid is thought to deplete NADPH and decrease the activity of these enzymes (9317)."

The lignans arctiin, arctigenin, and matairesinol are the major constituents in forsythia extract (102049, 102050).

Forsythia extracts may exert anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase and human leukocyte elastase (12615). Other in vitro research suggests it might inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), from mast cells and macrophages (12617, 106674). It also seems to inhibit leukotriene B4, which suggests it might be useful for treating skin conditions such as psoriasis (12615). In an animal model, topical application of forsythia extract reduced symptoms of atopic dermatitis by reducing production of inflammatory factors and inflammatory cell activity (98530).\n\nForsythia contains tannic acid which seems to have both antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties (12616).

Fo-ti has been linked to several cases of liver damage in adults and at least one case in a 5-year-old child (14339, 92895).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Fo-ti contains anthraquinone constituents, which can exert a stimulant laxative effect. Bulk-forming or emollient laxatives are preferred in pregnancy (272).

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, fo-ti may be unsafe.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting with use of unprocessed fo-ti.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hepatotoxicity with processed or unprocessed fo-ti.\nDermatologic\nOrally, one case of a fine maculopapular rash was reported in a patient taking the herbal product known as Shen-Min, which contains fo-ti. Symptoms resolved within three weeks after discontinuing the product (14482). It is unclear if the rash was due to fo-ti or other ingredients in the herbal product.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, unprocessed fo-ti may cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting (12, 50733).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, one case of mild eosinophilia was reported in a patient taking the herbal product known as Shen-Min, which contains fo-ti. Symptoms resolved within three weeks after discontinuing the product (14482). It is unclear if this reaction was due to fo-ti or other ingredients in the herbal product. A case of agranulocytosis was reported in a 65-year-old female taking fo-ti 30 grams/day for 17 days. The patient recovered gradually following a 15-day hospitalization, which included treatment with intravenous steroids and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (112231).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, cases of liver damage due to both processed and unprocessed fo-ti have been well documented in the medical literature. (7626, 7627, 14327, 14339, 14347, 14482, 16459, 17192, 50711, 50726)(50727, 50729, 92892, 92895, 112231).\n\nIn a systematic review, around 450 cases of hepatitis associated with fo-ti were identified. These cases occurred in patients 5-78 years of age. Liver damage occurred at a wide range of doses, formulations, and durations of intake. The type of liver injury ranged from hepatocellular, to cholestatic, or mixed. Outcomes ranged from full recovery to cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and/or death. The evidence suggests that when the daily fo-ti dose is less than 12 grams, the median time to occurrence of liver damage is 60 days. When the daily fo-ti dose is more than 12 grams, the median time to liver damage is 30 days (92895). Presenting signs and symptoms may include jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, myalgias, and elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), ferritin, transferrin, prothrombin time, and INR (17192, 92892). Other manifestations may include fever, skin rash, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and arthralgias. Symptoms and increased LFTs usually seem to resolve within a month after discontinuing fo-ti (7626, 7627, 14339, 14347, 14482, 16459). In one case series, liver enzymes began to normalize 48 hours after discontinuation of fo-ti and treatment with S-adenosylmethionine, compound glycyrrhizin injection, polyene phosphatidylcholine, and reduced glutathione. All patients were eventually discharged home in stable condition (92892). Rechallenge with fo-ti should not be attempted. A patient who had recovered from hepatitis associated with fo-ti use presented with myalgias and markedly elevated LFTs after a single dose of the herb (17192).\n\nIt is thought that this idiosyncratic reaction leading to liver damage is at least partially related to genetic polymorphisms. Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the predominant enzyme involved in biotransformation of emodin, a constituent of fo-ti thought to play a role in liver damage. In one genetic study, the frequency of CYP1A2*1C mutation in fo-ti induced drug-induced liver injury patients was 46.5%, which is significantly higher than the 27.9% frequency of liver injury reported in healthy patients without the mutation. Patients with a CYP1A2*1C mutation may have decreased activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme, which could inhibit the metabolism of fo-ti, causing an accumulation of toxic substances (92897).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nPatients presenting with fo-ti overdose may experience signs and symptoms consistent with liver damage. While hepatotoxicity associated with the use of fo-ti is more commonly reported after chronic use, some cases of fo-ti-related liver damage after only 1-5 days have been reported (92895). Presenting signs and symptoms of liver damage from fo-ti may include jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, myalgias, and elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), ferritin, transferrin, prothrombin time, and INR (17192, 92892).

For most constituents, the half-life was increased in animal models of liver injury (109611).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of fo-ti is the rhizome. Fo-ti root contains 40% to 50% starch and roughly 20% tannin. Constituents of fo-ti include stilbene glucosides (50723, 50731, 50704, 50713, 50709, 50714, 50722, 50715); anthraquinone derivatives such as chrysophanol, emodin, and physcion (emodin-3-methyl ether); a small amount of rhein (5, 16459), and questin, among others (50715).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that several chemical constituents of fo-ti (emodin, physcion, emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, physcion-8-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydtoxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) decrease significantly with processing (50714). Curing fo-ti reduces these constituents by 42% to 96% (50734).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that an ethanol extract of the stem of fo-ti exhibits inhibitory activity against at least one of a panel of enzymes often associated with inflammation (12480). The compound 2,3,4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-Β-D-glucoside suppresses the expression of COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (92896). In vivo and/or in vitro studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects occur by inhibition of the expression of certain pro-inflammatory signaling factors such as nuclear factor-kappa-Beta, TNF-alpha, iNOS, COX-2, and certain chemokines and cytokines (92899).\nAntiaging effects\nCured fo-ti might increase the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and decrease levels of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), lipid peroxide, and malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) (11); these are believed to be markers for anti-aging effects. In an animal study, a Chinese 13-herb mixture (Shou Xing Bu Zhi) that included fo-ti was reported to improve markers associated with the aging process (50730).\nAntiatherosclerosis\nAnimal research suggests that fo-ti stilbene glycoside, a water-soluble fraction of fo-ti, reduces the severity of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, and the atherosclerotic lesion area (50707). In addition, in vitro research shows that 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG), a compound extracted from the root of fo-ti, exhibits antiatherosclerotic effects on smooth muscle (50718). Other in vitro research shows that fo-ti extracts have protective effects against endothelial vascular cells by significantly inhibiting apoptosis in endothelial cells. This was accompanied by down regulation of caspase-3 gene expression and inhibition of DNA synthesis and growth (50717).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, fo-ti has antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (50725).\nAnticolitis effects\nIn vivo research suggests that 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside, an active component extracted from fo-ti, ameliorates colon damage in animal models of acute and chronic colitis, possibly by decreasing oxygen and nitrogen free radical levels and downregulating iNOS expression (50719).\nAntifibrotic effects\nIn humans, a mixed-ingredient decoction containing fo-ti decreased serum levels of hyaluronic acid, laminin, procollagen III, and collagen IV (32730).\nAntiosteoporosis effects\nEmodin regulates bone remodeling by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and stimulating osteoblast formation. Due to the antiinflammatory effects of 2,3,4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-Β-D-glucoside, it speculated that it may suppress osteoporosis as an immunological disorder. It also has a protective effect on H2O2-induced damage to osteoblasts (92896). Hot water extracts of fo-ti have been shown to inhibit bone deterioration in ovarectomy induced osteopenia in mice (92896). Additionally, in rats with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis,ethanol extracts of fo-ti improved bone density, reduced bone resorption, and suppressed cell death in bone marrow (115310).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that fo-ti extracts have antioxidant effects (50721, 99859). Some in vitro research shows that both processed and fermented fo-ti root have reduced antioxidant capacity compared with raw fo-ti root (99855).\nAntitumor effects\nThe root of fo-ti has been used for cancer. The extract has been reported to reduce tumor incidence in rats (50732). An emodin azide methyl anthraquinone derivative isolated from fo-ti had cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines in vitro (50724). In vitroresearch showed that three anthraquinones, physcion, emodin, and questin, isolated from a methanolic extract of the roots of fo-ti, inhibited the activity of Cdc25B phosphatase, which is involved in mitosis and has oncogenic properties. In addition, emodin and questin strongly inhibited the growth of a human colon cancer cell line (50715). A compound isolated from the roots of fo-ti inhibited DNA topoisomerase I and II In vitro (50713).\nAntiviral effects\nAn aqueous fo-ti extract has been shown to inhibit the replication of hepatitis B (11).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nSome evidence suggests the alcoholic extract of fo-ti might increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; reduce total cholesterol, free cholesterol, triglycerides; and slow development of atherosclerosis (11). Animal research has shown that the root of fo-ti exhibits inhibitory effect on triglyceride accumulation in the liver (50706). Some laboratory evidence and preliminary clinical research also suggests that fo-ti antagonizes the oxidation of lipoproteins and may regulate certain genes involved in the synthesis and/or metabolism of lipoproteins (99854).\nEstrogenic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that fo-ti has approximately 0.3% of the estrogen activity of 17-beta-estradiol itself and is approximately equivalent to the estrogen activity found in soy and red clover (10143, 16061, 50710).\nHair growth effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that fo-ti extracts can increase hair growth (99856, 99857). In vitro research shows that various constituents extracted from fo-ti root increase the proliferation of dermal papilla cells, which are major components of hair follicles. Specifically, the constituent torachrysone-8-O-beta-D-glucoside seems to have a greater effect on these cells than minoxidil (Rogaine). This compound also appears to increase hair fiber length (99856). Additionally, topical application of an extract of fo-ti leaves to mice with hair follicles in the resting (telogen) phase appears to induce the growth (anagen) phase of the hair growth cycle (99857).\nHypoglycemic effects\nFo-ti reportedly has hypoglycemic effects (5, 19).\nImmunologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that emodin, an active principle component of fo-ti, dose-dependently suppresses the mixed lymphocyte reaction (50723). Some evidence suggests fo-ti might also increase serum ceruloplasmin levels, reduce thymus gland atrophy, and inhibit atrophy of adrenal glands; enhancing nonspecific and cellular immunity, and antagonizing the immunosuppressive effects of prednisolone or hydrocortisone (11).\nLaxative effects\nRaw fo-ti root contains the anthraquinone derivatives, chrysophanol, emodin, and physcion (emodin-3-methyl ether), along with a small amount of rhein (5, 16459). These constituents have stimulant laxative effects, which may account for fo-ti's use in constipation. Some in vitro research shows that both fermented and processed fo-ti root have reduced laxative effects compared with raw fo-ti root (99855).\nLiver protective effects\nSome evidence suggests that isolated stilbene glycoside constituents in the raw fo-ti root might have liver protectant effects, including inhibition of alanine aminotransferase (ALT, formerly SGOT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (11). However, the anthraquinones in fo-ti are converted to highly reactive anthrones in the gastrointestinal tract, which may cause hepatitis (7626, 7627, 16459). In human research, a mixed-ingredient decoction containing fo-ti improved various serum markers of liver function and liver biochemistry, including ALT, total bilirubin, the albumin:globulin ratio, cholylglycine, prealbumin, and serum ferritin (32730). Experiments in mice have shown that the root of fo-ti exhibits inhibitory effects on triglyceride accumulation in the liver of mice induced by CCl4, cortisone acetate, and thioacetamide (50706). The root of fo-ti and its processed products also reduced enlargement of the liver.\nNeuroprotective effects\nSome research shows that fo-ti and the fo-ti constituent tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons in animal models of Parkinson disease, possibly through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (50716, 99858). Fo-ti extract also seems to protect against cognitive decline in mice with chemically-induced Alzheimer disease, possibly through increased antioxidant activity (99859).\nVasorelaxant effects\nIn vitro research showed that emodin, an active principle component of fo-ti, dose-dependently relaxed rat aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine and suppressed the response of human mononuclear cells to phytohemagglutinin (50723).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research suggests that fo-ti might reduce body weight. In mice fed a high-fat diet, supplementation with fo-ti reduced body weight and white adipose tissue while improving insulin sensitivity. Researchers theorize that fo-ti suppresses lipogenesis through downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and lipogenesis (109612)."

The main constituents of frankincense resin extract are boswellic acids (36.9%), such as alpha-boswellic acid and acetyl-boswellic acid (103854). Over 50 chemical constituents have been isolated in frankincense essential oil, with monoterpene hydrocarbons making up the majority (87.5%) of these compounds.

However, the antibacterial effects of frankincense essential oil were much weaker than ampicillin, rifampicin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and imipenem. (100931, 111507).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that frankincense essential oil has antifungal activity, with stronger effects on Cladosporium sphaerospermum, C. uredinicola, Aspergillus europaeus and Penicillium lanosum and weaker effects on P. atrosanguineum, P. bilaiae, A. niger, and A. flavus. It is thought that the antifungal activity is related to the frankincense constituents limonene, linalool, and alpha-terpineol. Frankincense essential oil vapor also appears to have some antifungal effects against some of these fungi, reducing detectable airborne fungi by 45.4% (100931).\nDermatologic effects\nIn human research, cream containing boswellic acids may improve the appearance of aging skin by reducing skin sebum and the ability to be distended, and increasing thickness (21156, 21157).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research suggests that frankincense, in combination with myrrh, may improve urothelial wound healing. In a study of female rats with chemically induced urothelial injury, oral use of frankincense and myrrh for 3 days improved pain tolerance and increased expression of zonula occluedens-2, a tight junction associated protein thought to be important for urothelial wound healing. It is unclear if this effect is due to frankincense, myrrh, or the combination (103856)."

These symptoms can occur commonly in some patients, but are generally mild at doses under 10 grams per day (745, 750, 8509, 98651, 107931). However, a meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies shows that taking FOS at doses ranging from 2.5 grams to 15 grams daily for up to 8 weeks does not increase the rate of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, or intestinal sounds when compared with control groups (110710).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nConstipation. Small clinical studies suggest that oral FOS may modestly improve symptoms in patients with constipation when used in combination with probiotics. The benefits of FOS when used alone are unclear.\nMost clinical research has evaluated the use of FOS for constipation in conjunction with probiotics. Preliminary clinical research in adults with chronic functional constipation shows that taking an unspecified dose of a specific product (Hexbio) consisting of FOS, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium infantis orally twice daily for 7 days increases defecation frequency by 3-fold when compared with placebo. Taking this product also improved patient reported symptoms of straining, lumpy hard stools, and incomplete evacuation sensations (90266). Other clinical research in adult females with constipation shows that taking a different product (Lactofos, SKL Functional Nutrition Ltda.) containing FOS 6 grams and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis 0.1-1 billion colony-forming units each, orally twice daily for 30 days, modestly increases the frequency of evacuation and decreases constipation severity when compared with placebo (90300). It is unclear if these effects are due to FOS, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nIn children aged 4-8 years with functional constipation, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a mixture of FOS 0.45 grams and polydextrose 4.17 grams orally daily for 45 days improves the weekly frequency of bowel movements, clinical manifestations of constipation, and quality of stool type when compared with baseline (106482). It is unclear if these effects are due to FOS, polydextrose, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nClinical research evaluating the use of FOS alone is limited. Preliminary clinical research in elderly males shows that taking FOS alone 3-10 grams daily for 30 days increases the frequency of defecation by 1.5-fold when compared with baseline (8505). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. In non-breastfeeding infants 6-24 months of age with constipation, preliminary clinical research shows that fortifying formula or milk with FOS daily for 4 weeks increases the frequency of soft stools by 33% and decreases the frequency of straining by 55% when compared with placebo. However, the use of FOS did not increase the percentage of infants who achieved normal bowel pattern. The daily dose of FOS was 6 grams for infants 6-8.9 kg, 9 grams for infants 9-11.9 kg, and 12 grams for infants over 12 kg (98651).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral FOS has only been evaluated in combination with probiotics; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a combination product containing FOS 500 mg, Bacillus coagulans 100 billion spores, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), and Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 billion CFUs once daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 17 mg/dL, compared with an increase of 3 mg/dL with placebo. However, taking this product did not affect body weight, waist circumference, or cholesterol levels. It is unclear if this effect is due to FOS, other ingredients, or the combination (107731).\nless\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is unclear if oral FOS is beneficial in patients undergoing HSCT.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT shows that taking a specific oral FOS supplement, (Fibrulose F97, Cosucra Groupe) 5-15 grams daily for 21 days, beginning 5 days before transplant, does not reduce acute graft-versus-host disease, blood stream infections, or Clostridioides difficile infections or improve overall survival when compared with control (107931). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there has been interest in using oral FOS for hypercholesterolemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of FOS for this purpose.\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral FOS for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of FOS for this purpose.\nOsteoporosis. Oral FOS has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking a specific FOS product (NutraFlora, Ingredion Inc.) 3.2 grams plus calcium 800 mg daily for 24 months reduces the decline in total-body bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with calcium alone, but not when compared with a maltodextrin control. In a subgroup of patients with osteopenia, this combination reduced the decline in BMD in the lumbar vertebrae when compared with calcium alone or a maltodextrin control (94931).\nless\nTravelers' diarrhea. It is unclear if oral FOS is beneficial for preventing traveler's' diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking FOS 10 grams orally daily for 4 weeks, starting 2 weeks before traveling to a medium- to high-risk destination, does not reduce the incidence of travelers' diarrhea when compared with placebo (10373).

They are not absorbed in the body (750, 8505, 8507, 8508, 8509, 8563).\nMetabolism\nIn the colon, FOS are metabolized by bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (750, 8505, 8507, 8508, 8509, 8563). They are not hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes (746), and they are not recoverable in the feces. This suggests complete metabolism by colonic microflora (747).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFOS are plant sugars. They occur in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and cereals. Chemically, FOS are made up of one sucrose molecule bonded to two, three, or four fructose molecules. They are produced commercially from sucrose using an enzymatic process, or they can be produced by partial hydrolysis of chicory inulin from asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, and soybeans (746, 750, 8507, 8563, 98651).\nAnti-colon cancer effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that FOS might protect against colon cancer (748). In experimental models of colon cancer, FOS seem to stimulate local immune surveillance to inhibit tumor formation (8506).\nAntidiabetes effects\nThere is interest in using FOS as a replacement for dextrose in patients with diabetes. Preliminary clinical research in adults without diabetes shows that fully or partially replacing dextrose with FOS, either alone or as part of a meal, reduces postprandial elevations of blood glucose and insulin. However, the effects of FOS on total daily sugar or calorie consumption have not been evaluated (107732).\nBone health effects\nSome evidence in post-menopausal adults taking calcium shows that FOS might help to maintain bone mass. It is thought that calcium absorption might be enhanced with the use of FOS. Lab markers also suggest that taking FOS with calcium reduces bone turnover. However, more research is needed (94931).\nGastrointestinal effects\nFOS, alone or in combination with probiotics, increase defecation frequency and reduce bowel transit time in humans (8505, 90266, 90300, 98651). As a prebiotic fiber, FOS promote colonic fermentation leading to increased fecal biomass (744).\nHypolipidemic effects\nFOS promote colonic fermentation leading to increased fecal biomass, decreased ceco-colonic pH, and production of short chain fatty acids. The short chain fatty acids exert systemic effects on lipid metabolism similar to dietary fiber (744).\nIron absorption effects\nThere is interest in using FOS to increase the oral absorption of iron. Preliminary clinical research in adult females shows that taking FOS 15 grams orally as a single dose increases the fractional iron absorption from oral ferrous sulfate, containing 104 mg iron, by 51% when compared with control (107729).\nPrebiotic effects\nFOS have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are substances that selectively promote the growth and activity of specific species of bacteria in the gut. FOS passes undigested through the small intestine. Colonic bacteria that produce acids, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, are symbiotic with FOS. In the colon, FOS specifically promote the growth of these beneficial bacteria, which in turn produce enzymes that metabolize FOS (750, 8505, 8507, 8508, 8509, 8563, 94930, 98651). Numerous studies have shown that prebiotics (such as inulin, FOS, and galacto-oligosaccharides) promote the establishment of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the infant gut, which mimics the flora of breastfed infants (26719, 26730, 99215). Clinical research studies in adults also suggest that FOS intake increases bifidobacteria population and proportion of gut microbiota, an effect that is amplified at durations exceeding 4 weeks and doses exceeding 5 grams daily when compared with individuals without FOS supplementation. Researchers theorize that bifidobacterial contain beta-fructosidase, which an enzyme is selective for the abundant beta-1-2 glycosidic linkages found in FOS (110710).\nSatiety effects\nSome types of soluble fiber aid in satiety, potentially reducing food intake and helping with weight maintenance. It is thought that the production of short chain fatty acids by bacteria in the colon exposed to FOS has systemic effects on gut hormones, gastric motility, or glucose response. It is not clear if FOS increase satiety or reduce food intake in humans; evidence is mixed, with at least some research suggesting no effect (94928).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using FOS for weight loss. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults shows that taking a combination product containing FOS 3 grams, cocoa 250 mg, coffee 6 grams, and up to 1.98 grams caffeine twice daily for 10 weeks does not reduce body weight or waist circumference when compared with baseline. However, taking the combination did reduce body fat by 2% to 3% when compared with baseline (107932). It is unclear if this effect is due to FOS, other ingredients, or the combination."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Fucus vesiculosus is the entire plant. Fucus vesiculosus is a brown alga (seaweed). It contains a high concentration of iodine, which is present in varying amounts. It can also contain heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium. Fucus vesiculosus is also a source of fiber, minerals such as iron and vitamin B12, and polysaccharides such as fucoidan (12789, 12798).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model of inflammation, fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, can inhibit leukocyte recruitment (74149).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that a mucopolysaccharide isolated from Fucus vesiculosus can inhibit the growth of Neisseria meningitides and Escherichia coli (12791). Other in vitro research shows that Fucus vesiculosus extracts have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), regardless of what season the seaweed was harvested (100848).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary research suggests that fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, might have antiangiogenic and antitumor activity (12798, 97791). In vitro, fucoidan has possible additive or synergistic effects with chemotherapy agents. Any anticancer effects of fucoidan are possibly related to the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (97791). Fucoidan might also help prevent cancer metastasis. In vitro research shows that fucoidan can inhibit the adhesion of breast cancer cells to platelets, which might prevent tumor metastasis (74149). Other in vitro research shows that Fucus vesiculosus extracts have radical scavenging activity, resulting in apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. The highest activity occurs if the seaweed is harvested during the summer months and has high levels of phlorotannin (100848).\nAnticoagulant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, has anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and antiplatelet adhesion effects (12797, 74116, 74156, 74240). However, pharmacokinetic research shows that taking 3 grams of 75% fucoidan orally does not have clinically relevant anticoagulation activity, probably due to low intestinal absorption (74183).\nAntidiabetes effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of extract from Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus (Insea2, innoVactiv Inc.) 250 mg decreases postprandial insulin concentrations by about 12%; however, postprandial glucose concentrations are not significantly affected (74215). In vitro evidence suggests that this combination of Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus improve postprandial insulinemia by inhibiting alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities (74215).\nAntifertility effects\nLaboratory research suggests that fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, might have antifertility effects by preventing the binding of sperm to egg (12795).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that a lectin-like mucopolysaccharide isolated from Fucus vesiculosus can inhibit the growth of Candida guilliermondii (74247).\nAntiviral effects\nFucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, seems to be active against a variety of viruses including the herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1, and cytomegalovirus (12792, 12794, 74195).\nDermatologic effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests topical application of Fucus vesiculosus extract might reduce skin thickness and other signs of aging (12799). In vitro evidence suggests that Fucus vesiculosus alters skin thickness and other mechanical properties of the skin by increasing the expression of cell surface integrins (12799).\n\nFucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, seems to stimulate the activity of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta to increase fibroblast proliferation in vitro. This suggests that Fucus vesiculosus might be useful for treatment of wound healing (12796).\nHormonal effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Fucus vesiculosus 0.7-1.4 grams daily during menstrual cycle can extend the menstrual cycle and have anti-estrogenic effects in premenopausal women. It may also increase progesterone levels (12790).\nNeuroprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, protects against cholinergic neuronal death. Potential mechanisms of action include its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory , and cholinesterase inhibitory effects (74197).\nWeight loss effects\nTheoretically, the thyroid stimulatory properties of Fucus vesiculosus may cause hypermetabolic weight loss. Although its anorectic properties have not been adequately evaluated in humans, genomic studies suggest fucoxanthin, a constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, can induce thermogenin in abdominal white adipose tissue mitochondria, resulting in fatty acid oxidation and heat production (74196). Fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol, another constituent of Fucus vesiculosus, may inhibit the differentiation of adipocyte cells, perhaps by downregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma (74140)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFulvic acid is a group of low molecular weight (approximately 2 kDa) yellow-brown, aromatic, organic, acidic polymers formed by the action of microbes on dead plant and animal material. It is a component of humus, the organic matter found in soil, sediment, peat, lignite, and aquatic environments. Fulvic acid forms a loose mass of polymers with many carboxyl groups that can release hydrogen ions, making it reactive with metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and heavy metal toxins (27721, 27727, 27733, 27738, 29970, 29971).\nAnti-allergy effects\nIn vitro research shows that fulvic acid does not affect the viability of rat histamine-releasing cells. However, fulvic acid inhibits beta-hexosaminidase release from these cells following IgE-sensitization and antigen-stimulation, at the antigen-antibody binding stage and the antibody-receptor binding stage. Also, fulvic acid inhibits histamine release from stimulated human basophilic cells, and decreases intracellular calcium levels (27729).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that fulvic acid, at concentrations greater than 200 mcg/mL, reduces the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from differentiated U937 cells (27732).\nAnti-prion effects\nIn vitro research suggests that fulvic acid reduces the amount of beta-sheet content in human prion protein fragment 90-231 (27739). There was also an increased sensitivity to protease K, an inhibition of entering in the fibrillogenic pathway, the development of unstructured peptide aggregation, and an inhibition of human prion protein fragment 90-231 internalization in human neuroblastoma cells.\nAntidementia effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that fulvic acid interrupts the formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) (17-42) dimer and trimer, suggesting an inhibition of Abeta (17-42) aggregation (27730). In vitro, fulvic acid inhibits the aggregation of tau protein, inhibiting fibril length production as well as acting on preformed fibrils (27731).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that oxifulvic acid (fulvic acid derived from coal using controlled wet oxidation) has antimicrobial effects against microbial pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae at concentrations of less than 5 grams/L (27733).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro research shows that fulvic acid has anticancer activity against breast, cervical, and lung cancer cell lines (27734).\nAntioxidant and oxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that aqueous fulvic acid has antioxidant effects, resulting in reduced hydroxyl radical formation. However, at certain pH values, hydroxyl radical formation increases (27735). Other research suggests that fulvic acid increases lipid peroxidation of cartilage cell membranes in vitro, as well as increasing lipid peroxidation in the liver and blood of animals. This peroxidation is reduced when the hydroxyl group of fulvic acid is blocked and inhibited by selenium or superoxide dismutase (27736, 27737). In vitro research suggests that some fulvic acids accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals and scavenge superoxide radicals; however, fulvic acid from peat scavenges both of these agents (27738).\nAntiviral effects\nFulvic acid contains envelope virus-neutralizing compounds (27740). Therefore, it may render vaccinia virus, HIV, and SARS virus noninfectious. Also, it may inactivate various strains of influenza, including H5N1. In vitro, fulvic acid reduces poliovirus recovery in filters from water seeded with poliovirus (27741).\nHematological effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that some fulvic acids shorten prothrombin time in human plasma (27726).\nImmune effects\nAnimal research shows that fulvic acid increases the ovalbumin antibody titer and the immune response, and increases the diameter of the B-dependent lymphoid tissue in ileum and spleen, suggesting that fulvic acid may function as a humoral immune stimulant (27727).\nSkeletal effects\nIt is hypothesized that fulvic acid can increase the production of free radical carriers that may interfere with chondrocyte metabolism (27722). In animal research, fulvic acid from contaminated drinking water was shown to accumulate in the skeletal system in the form of semiquinone radicals (27723). Other evidence from an animal embryo model suggests that treatment of a fertilized chicken egg with fulvic acid decreases the mass of long bones by 25%, decreases mineral content of long bones by 15%, reduces total protein and DNA content, and increases the amount of precursor forms of collagen II in articular cartilage, when compared with untreated fertilized chicken eggs (27724).\nThyroid effects\nAnimal research shows that fulvic acid increases the level of plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and decreases the thyroxine (T4):triiodothyronine (T3) ratio (27727).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research in rats with skin wounds shows that applying fulvic acid 0.5% topically for 4 weeks improved wound healing rates and neutrophil infiltration rates when compared with control (112189)."
