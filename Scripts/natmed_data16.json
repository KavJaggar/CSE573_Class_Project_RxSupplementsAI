            "Overview": "Oak moss (Evernia prunasti) is a species of lichen (102534). It often grows on deciduous trees, especially oaks and other broadleaf trees or shrubs. It has been traditionally used as an antipyretic and astringent (106676).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in prepared teas or aqueous forms for short periods of time. Although water extracts of oak moss may contain thujone and usnic acid, which can cause toxicity, the concentrations are thought to be relatively low (12). Oak moss products that are thujone-free have generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status in the US for use as a food additive (4912).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally long-term, in large amounts of tea, or as a hot alcoholic extract (12). These formulations may contain a toxic ethyl ester or enough thujone to cause kidney damage (4, 12). There are also case reports of hepatotoxicity associated with usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss (7091, 81595, 81600, 81607, 81612, 81619).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of oak moss when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. The constituent thujone shows evidence of uterine stimulant activity (19).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, oak moss seems to be well tolerated when taken in small amounts, short-term. However, a high-quality assessment of safety has not been conducted. When oak moss is used long-term, in large amounts of tea, or as a hot alcoholic extract, it may be unsafe due to various constituents, including thujone and usnic acid.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nTopically: Oak moss may cause contact sensitivity and allergic reactions in people with lichen and moss allergy. Usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, also can cause conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, and local irritation.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Large amounts or long-term use of oak moss may cause convulsions, kidney damage, liver damage, restlessness, tremors, vertigo, and vomiting.\nDermatologic\nTopically, use of oak moss may cause contact sensitivity and allergic reactions in people with lichen and moss allergy (4023, 4033, 4034, 4039, 108403). In patch testing, very late reactions have occurred, some as late as 27 days after application (108403). Usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, also can cause allergic contact dermatitis with respiratory symptoms (11720, 81580, 81632).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, large amounts or long-term use of thujone-containing products may cause vomiting (12).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, has been associated with reports of hepatotoxicity. From July to December 2000 there were at least seven cases of acute hepatotoxicity in patients taking LipoKinetix, a product containing usnic acid as sodium usniate. Symptoms including nausea, weakness and fatigue, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin usually developed from 2 weeks to 3 months after starting LipoKinetix and resolved upon discontinuation (7091). It is unclear if the sodium usniate ingredient is the cause of these adverse events. There are also individual case reports suggesting the development of hepatotoxicity related to the use of other weight loss products containing usnic acid (81595, 81600, 81607, 81612, 81619).\nless\nImmunologic\nTopically, use of oak moss may cause contact sensitivity and allergic reactions in people with lichen and moss allergy (4023, 4033, 4034, 4039, 108403).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of oak moss.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of oak moss is the plant body. Oak moss contains polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, sterols, and terpenoids. Notable constituents include atranorin, evernic acid, usnic acid, and a ketone compound called thujone, (12, 106676, 115968).\nAnalgesic effects\nUsnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (11720, 81630).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAtranorin, evernic acid, and usnic acid, constituents of oak moss, demonstrate anti-inflammatory potential through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, specifically cyclooxygenase-2 (11720, 81630, 115969).\nAntibacterial effects\nOak moss extract has demonstrated in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Laboratory research suggests that the constituents usnic acid and/or evernic acid are responsible for these antibacterial effects (106676).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary research on leukemia cells suggests that the usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, might have anti-proliferative activity (11720). Usnic acid also seems to have cytotoxic effects and inhibits the proliferation of other cancer cell lines in vitro and in animal models (81597, 81599, 81605, 81611).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn an animal model of diabetes, oak moss extract reduces blood glucose levels, triglycerides, and very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (115968). Additional research suggests that oak moss constituents may help regulate blood glucose levels through inhibition of alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity (115969).\nAntifungal effects\nOak moss extract has demonstrated in vitro activity against Candida albicans (106676).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, oak moss extract acts as an antioxidant through free radical scavenging and metal ion chelation. These antioxidant properties may be related to polyphenol content in oak moss, especially atranorin and evernic acid (106676, 115969).\nAntiparasitic effects\nUsnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, has antiprotozoal activity in vitro and in animal models. Usnic acid seems to cause parasitic lysis (11720, 81602, 81627, 81633).\nAntipyretic effects\nUsnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (11720, 81630).\nAntiviral effects\nUsnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, has antiviral activity (11720, 81582). Usnic acid seems to inhibit RNA transcription (81582, 81626).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using oak moss for hypertension. In vitro research shows that oak moss induces vasodilation, possibly via activity in the soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine-3',\"-'onophosphate pathway. Animal research in rats with chemically-induced hypertension shows that taking oak moss orally 200 mg/kg daily for 1-7 days reduces systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate by 15% to 28% when compared with baseline (106677).\nGastroprotective effects\nIn an animal model of gastric ulcers, usnic acid, a constituent of oak moss, had gastroprotective effects related to antioxidant activity. The gastric lesions were reduced (81615, 81616).\nHepatotoxic effects\nOak moss contains thujone. Some evidence suggests thujone might exacerbate liver conditions, including porphyria (12). Laboratory results suggest that usnic acid, another constituent of oak moss, is a strong hepatotoxic agent that triggers oxidative stress and disrupts the normal metabolic processes of cells (81593, 81594, 81600, 81607, 81612). An animal study reported that high doses of usnic acid may cause destruction of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in hepatocytes, causing hepatotoxicity (81593). Usnic acid is thought to induce hepatotoxicity through stimulation of porimin (pro-oncosis receptor inducing membrane injury), a protein responsible for the formation of irreversible pores in the membranes of human liver cells and their subsequent death (108404).\nNeurologic effects\nOak moss contains thujone, a neurotoxin. Thujone intoxication causes psychoactivity resembling that of cannabinoid intoxication (12).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that oak moss extracts, and the constituents evernic acid and atranorin, demonstrate potential neuroprotective properties through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of enzymes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase enzymes (115969). In a mouse model of Parkinson disease, usnic acid, another constituent of oak moss, ameliorated motor dysfunction and protected against dopaminergic neuronal loss through attenuation of neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra and by reducing astroglial activation (108405).\nUterine effects\nOak moss contains thujone (12). Some evidence suggests thujone-containing volatile oils have uterine stimulant effects (19).\nWeight loss\nOak moss contains usnic acic. Certain dietary supplements that are promoted as a diet aid for weight loss have used isolated usnic acid. It is hypothesized that the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by usnic acid would cause cells to burn up excess energy stored in fats (81614)."

    "Oats": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Oats are a type of cereal grain that has been cultivated since the Bronze Age (91458). When consumed as part of the diet they are a good source of protein, fat, and fiber (4960, 4961, 4963, 4970). The FDA allows food products containing oats, with at least 750 mg of soluble fiber per serving, to include a health claim stating that they may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol (5792, 5797, 102336).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in food amounts (4960, 4969, 5792, 5797). Oat bran has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912). Whole grain oats 50-100 grams daily have been used for up to 1 year without serious adverse effects (97520).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used topically and appropriately (12). Lotion containing colloidal oat 1% has been used topically without adverse effects for up to 6 weeks (97518, 103340).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of oats when used orally in medicinal amounts.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in food amounts (5792, 5797).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, oats are well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal distension, bloating, flatulence, and unpleasant taste.\n\nTopically: Burning, contact dermatitis, itching, and redness.\nDermatologic\nTopically, oat-containing preparations can cause contact dermatitis (12515). Redness, burning, and itchiness have also been reported (103340).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nWhen consumed orally, oats provide fiber. Increasing fiber in the diet can cause flatulence, bloating, abdominal distention, and unpleasant taste. To minimize side effects, doses should be slowly titrated to the desired level. These adverse effects usually subside with continued use (12514).\n\nIn patients who have difficulty chewing food, or those with conditions that decrease small bowel motility, oat bran may cause bezoars (concretions) and intestinal obstruction. Oats and oat bran are unlikely to cause obstruction without other causative factors (4979, 4985).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn a case report, a 45-year-old male developed acute generalized urticaria, facial angioedema, and dyspnea immediately after consuming oat flour. The reaction resolved after emergency care for anaphylaxis. Further investigation revealed an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to oat proteins (113490).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). A diet high in soluble fiber, such as that found in oats, reduces the risk of CHD.\nClinical research shows that a diet containing foods high in fiber, such as oats, oat bran, or whole oat flour, reduces the risk of CHD (2737, 4960, 4962, 4963, 4964, 4965, 4966, 4967, 4968). In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a health claim stating that consuming at least 3 grams of soluble fiber per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD (102336). However, clinical studies show that at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber daily is needed to reduce the risk of CHD (5786, 5787, 5788, 5794, 5795, 5796).\nless\nDyslipidemia. A diet rich in soluble fiber, such as that found in oats, can reduce cholesterol by a moderate amount.\nOats, oat bran, and other soluble fibers can modestly reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, especially when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat. Consuming 56-150 grams of whole oat products such as oatmeal and oat bran, containing 3.6-10 grams of soluble fiber daily, can significantly lower total and LDL cholesterol levels. For each gram of soluble fiber consumed, total cholesterol decreases by about 1.4 mg/dL and LDL by about 1.2 mg/dL. Eating 3-10 grams of soluble fiber daily can reduce total cholesterol by about 4-14 mg/dL (4976, 4977, 5786, 5788, 5792, 5794, 5795, 8521, 107749, 113488, 113495). For example, eating 3 bowls of oatmeal (28 gram servings) daily, providing a total of 3 grams of soluble fiber daily, can decrease total cholesterol by about 5 mg/dL (5788). However, consuming more than 10 grams of soluble fiber daily doesn't seem to increase effectiveness (5788).\n\nA meta-analysis comparing the effects of oats and isolated beta-glucans shows that both products similarly impact lipid profiles, suggesting that the bioactive component of oats are beta-glucans (113488). Oat bran products, such as oat bran muffins and oat bran flakes, may vary in their ability to lower cholesterol, depending on the total soluble fiber content and other dietary variables (6188). Whole oat products might be more effective for lowering LDL and total cholesterol than foods containing oat bran plus soluble fiber (10145).\n\nAlthough oats are shown to lower total and LDL cholesterol, a meta-analysis and a small clinical study in adults with and without dyslipidemia shows that consuming oatmeal or oat products does not reduce triglycerides or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with controls (113488, 113495).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. A diet rich in whole grains, such as oats, may help prevent diabetes or improve blood glucose control in patients with type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes.\nPopulation research shows that for every 16 gram daily serving of whole grains, including oats, there is a 7% to 11% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (100622). There is also evidence that consuming oats can decrease blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as lipid levels, in patients with diabetes. The glycemic effects of oats depend on the level of processing of the oat products. Consuming intact oat kernels or thick-cut oats (>0.6 mm) reduces postprandial blood glucose and insulin, but consuming thin-cut, or \"quick\", oats has no effect (105536). Clinical research shows that consuming oats and oat bran for 4-8 weeks decreases pre-prandial blood glucose, 24-hour plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes (4980, 4982, 6266, 103345). Various doses have been used, including 3 grams of soluble fiber daily, or bread providing 34 grams of total fiber daily (9 grams of soluble fiber) (4961, 4980). Additional clinical research in obese adults with type 2 diabetes shows that eating whole grain oats 50-100 grams daily in place of other carbohydrates reduces postprandial blood glucose by 19-27 mg/dL when compared with other carbohydrates in a healthy diet. After 1 year, the groups consuming 50 grams and 100 grams of oats had an additional 0.48% and 0.64% reduction in HbA1c, respectively, when compared with the regular healthy diet group (97520). There is also some evidence that consuming oats 50 grams daily, containing 25 grams of soluble fiber, might be more effective for improving glycemic control and decreasing hyperinsulinemia than the standard moderate fiber diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (6266).\n\nOats have also been evaluated in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. One very small clinical study shows that taking 50 grams of a specific oat product (Betaglucare), providing beta-glucans 6 grams, in three divided doses daily for one week is beneficial for glycemic control and variability when compared with a standard diet without beta-glucans or with taking only 25 grams of the product daily. Maximal, mean, and pre- and post-meal blood glucose levels were modestly lower, and minimal blood glucose levels were modestly higher. Most measures of glycemic variability were statistically different, although there were no differences in the duration of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia between groups (105261).\n\nOats have also been evaluated in patients with gestational diabetes. A randomized, controlled trial shows that taking 30 grams of a specific oat bran product (OAB; Golden Light Cup Company) orally twice daily at lunch and dinner for 4 weeks improves mean fasting blood glucose and two-hour postprandial glucose when compared with a control group. After 4 weeks, the mean fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose in the treatment group were 85 mg/dL and 104 mg/dL, respectively, compared with 93 mg/dL and 117 mg/dL, respectively, in the control group (107751). The validity of this study is limited by the short treatment duration and lack of follow-up.\nless\nGastric cancer. A diet rich in soluble fiber, such as that found in oats, might reduce the risk of gastric cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming a diet that includes cereal fiber, such as oats and oat bran, might reduce the incidence of gastric cancer (10435).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nColorectal cancer. Regular consumption of oats does not seem to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming oat bran or oats orally doesn't seem to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Additionally, consuming fiber, including oat-bran fiber, is not associated with a reduction in the risk for recurrence of colorectal adenomas (4820, 5104).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there is interest in using topical oats for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nAnxiety. Although there is interest in using oral oats for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical colloidal oatmeal cream may be beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream containing colloidal oatmeal 1% daily for 2 weeks moderately reduces the severity of atopic dermatitis when compared with baseline (103344). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nOther research suggests that colloidal oatmeal may be beneficial when used in combination with topical steroids. Clinical research shows that the benefits obtained from applying an ointment containing fluocinolone 0.025% to the hands for 2 weeks were better maintained in the patients who also used a cream containing colloidal oatmeal 1% during this time period and for an additional 4 weeks when compared with patients using fluocinolone and the cream base without colloidal oatmeal. Quality of life was also improved in the patients using colloidal oatmeal (103340).\nless\nBreast cancer. Observational research suggests that regular oatmeal intake may be associated with reduced mortality from breast cancer.\nPopulation research in postmenopausal patients has found that those who have eaten 50 grams of oatmeal daily prior to a breast cancer diagnosis have a 20% reduced risk of all-cause mortality in the 7 years following the diagnosis when compared with patients who have not eaten oatmeal. However, no benefit was seen when post-diagnostic oatmeal intakes were examined (103343).\nless\nBurns. Although there is interest in using topical oats for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral oats for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral oats are beneficial in healthy adults with mild memory impairment.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy middle-aged adults with self-reported memory decline shows that consuming a specific wild green-oats extract (Neuravena, Frutarom) 800 mg as a single dose improves overall speed, but not overall accuracy, of cognitive performance when compared with placebo. However, a higher dose of 1600 mg was ineffective (97519).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if applying lotion containing colloidal oat extract improves dry skin to a greater extent than other lotion products.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a lotion containing colloidal oat extract (Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief 24Hr Moisturizing Lotion, Johnson & Johnson) twice daily for 2 weeks improves itchiness, cracking, scaling, dryness, and roughness when compared to baseline in females with dry skin (91458). Additional preliminary clinical research shows that applying a colloidal oatmeal lotion to the legs twice daily for three weeks reduces skin dryness and improves skin integrity when compared to baseline in adults with dry skin (97518). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral oats are beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nA small clinical trial shows that eating two cookies containing oat flour 60 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces muscle soreness 48 or 72 hours after downhill running when compared with baseline (103341).\nless\nFat redistribution syndrome. It is unclear if oral oats are beneficial for fat redistribution syndrome.\nConsumption of a high fiber diet, including oats, with adequate energy and protein might prevent fat deposition in patients with HIV. A one-gram increase in total dietary fiber may decrease the risk of fat deposition by 7% (12517).\nless\nGallbladder disease. Although there is interest in using oral oats for gallbladder disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral oats are beneficial for hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 21 clinical studies in healthy adults and those with a variety of metabolic conditions including hypertension shows that consumption of oat products reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 3 mmHg but has no effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with control. Subgroup analysis suggests that consuming oat products reduces SBP by 10 mmHg in patients with hypertension at baseline. An additional subgroup analysis suggests that consuming at least 5 grams of beta-glucan-enriched oats daily or consuming oats for a duration at least 8 weeks reduces SBP and DBP (113494).\n\nObservational research has found that consumption of oats as oatmeal or oat cereal does not seem to reduce DBPor SBP in males with minor elevations in blood pressure or patients with dyslipidemia (2956, 113495). A randomized, controlled trial in patients with stage 1 hypertension receiving dietary guidance shows that taking 30 grams of oat bran, providing 8.9 grams of dietary fiber, once daily with breakfast or in between meals for 3 months improves various blood pressure measures when compared with dietary guidance alone. After 3 months of treatment, 24-hour maximum SBP and DBP decreased by 14 mmHg and 11 mmHg, respectively, and office SBP and DBP decreased by 15 mmHg and 10 mmHg, respectively. Oat consumption may also have impacted antihypertensive medication use. Two patients in the control group increased doses of antihypertensive medications, whereas 6 patients in the treatment group decreased doses and 1 patient discontinued use (107750). The effect of oral oat bran on patients with stage 2 hypertension or pre-hypertension is unknown.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although there is interest in using oral oats for IBS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nMetabolic syndrome. Limited research suggests that oats may not be beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that adding oat bran 40 grams daily for 6 weeks to a low-calorie diet does not reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome. Oat bran also does not improve body weight, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood glucose levels when compared with a low-calorie diet alone in patients with metabolic syndrome (103342).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there is interest in using oral oats for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this condition.\nPruritus. Applying oat lotion topically may improve some types of pruritus.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying an oat lotion (Espanol) twice daily for up to 2 weeks can decrease itching intensity by about 20% when compared to baseline in patients with pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease (uremic pruritus). This decrease is similar to the effects of applying vinegar 5% solution or taking hydroxyzine 10 mg orally. However, applying the oat lotion does not appear to decrease the frequency of itching (91457).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using topical oats for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there is interest in using oral oats for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oats for this purpose.\nStroke. It is unclear if oral oats are beneficial for reducing the risk of stroke.\nPopulation research suggests that consuming oatmeal for breakfast once weekly might reduce the incidence of stroke by a small amount when compared with consuming white bread or eggs for breakfast (103337).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral oats have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific oat-based product (Profermin, Nordisk Rebalance) containing fermented oat flour, Lactobacillus plantarum, barley malt flour, and lecithin, 250 mL orally twice daily for 8 weeks, reduces disease activity and increases remission in about two-fold more patients with relapsing ulcerative colitis, when compared with treatment with a specific nutritional beverage (Fresubin Original, Fresenius Kabi) (90271).\nless\nWound healing.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the pharmacokinetics of oats.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of oats are the seeds, straw, and bran. Oat bran is milled from the outer layer of hulled whole oats. Oats are a good source of protein, fat, and fiber. They contain both soluble and insoluble fiber, but a greater proportion of soluble fiber than any other grain (4960, 4961, 4963, 4970). Colloidal oatmeal is the ground and processed oat grain (91458).\n\nAvenanthramides are a group of phenolic compounds thought to be found only in oats. Oat products contain 2-82 mcg/gram of these compounds, and typical daily intakes in people who consume oats regularly are between 0.3 and 2.1 mg daily (100623). Oats also contain many more bound than free phenolics, including cinnamic acids, benzoic acids, and benzaldehydes (113493).\nAnti-cancer effects\nAlthough earlier studies did not differentiate between types of fiber (5105, 5106, 5108), later studies indicate that oat bran, unlike wheat bran, does not protect against colon cancer (5104, 5107).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of oats. A meta-analysis and a small clinical study in patients with various health conditions shows no difference in changes in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-8 following at least 2 weeks of oat consumption. Sub-analysis suggests that oat consumption may reduce CRP and IL-6 levels in patients with one or more comorbidities, such as hyperlipidemia (107752, 113495).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe avenanthramides found in oats have strong antioxidant activity that reduces blood inflammatory markers, decreases generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increases antioxidant capacity during exercise. In healthy, young females, consuming oat flakes at a dose providing 1 gram/kg body weight of carbohydrates prior to high-intensity interval training reduces post-exercise levels of ROS in capillary blood when compared with not consuming oats (105535). In individuals with mild hypercholesterolemia, consuming oats for 45 days increases serum total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and decreased malondialdehyde when compared with control (113495).\nDermatological effects\nOats are commonly added to creams and lotions for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that might reduce itchiness, redness, and other symptoms. Constituents such as avenanthramides have been shown to reduce skin symptoms and histamine release from mast cells in animal models (91457, 91458). Other possible benefits include reducing skin pH and improving the skin microbiome composition and skin barrier function (91457, 103344). In laboratory research in keratinocytes, oat extracts inhibit the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines (91458). Oat extracts might also have antioxidant effects in skin cells (91458).\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nOat bran decreases serum cholesterol, decreases absorption of cholesterol or fatty acids, and decreases absorption of biliary cholesterol or bile acids (4974, 4960, 4963). Oats contain beta-glucan, also known as oat gum, a water soluble polysaccharide fiber (4961, 4981). Beta-glucan is thought to be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effects of oats. Soluble fibers, such as beta-glucan, lower cholesterol levels by binding with bile acids in the gut and increasing fecal bile acid excretion (4974, 5786, 5787, 5789). This decreases enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, which increases hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, increases up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and increases clearance of LDL cholesterol (4984, 5786, 5787).\n\nBeta-glucan might also decrease cholesterol absorption by inhibiting the formation of micelles, which are necessary for fat absorption (5786). There is also some evidence that consuming oats can alter and improve the gut microbiome, resulting in fermentation of soluble fibers, such as beta-glucan, into beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valeric acid. Absorption of these SCFAs might inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver (5786, 5787, 5788, 107749, 113495). However, the exact mechanism of how the gut microbiome and its metabolites are impacted by oat consumption to improve lipid profiles remains unclear.\n\nOats also contain alpha-tocotrienols, an isomer of vitamin E. There is some preliminary evidence that alpha-tocotrienols can inhibit hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme required for cholesterol synthesis (5786).\nHypoglycemic effects\nThe beta-glucan in oats increases the viscosity of food in the small intestine and delays absorption, thereby reducing peak postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels in people with and without diabetes (4961, 4980, 4981, 4982, 4983, 5796, 100662). Beta-glucan also reduces the porosity of the mucus in the intestinal mucus layer, slowing nutrient absorption (105536). One study shows that drinking orange juice with beta-glucan enriched oat bran reduces urinary flavanone excretion by about 70% without impacting time to excretion, supporting the theory that oat bran fiber reduces absorption as opposed to impacting transit time in the gastrointestinal tract (113493).\n\nSome clinical research shows that oats consumed as flakes result in lower blood glucose and insulin levels when compared to oats consumed as flour in healthy adults. This might be explained by the greater availability of starch in the oat flour compared to the oat flakes (97521). Processing oats compromises the structural integrity of the kernel, enhancing starch digestion by pancreatic amylases and resulting in a loss of the glycemic benefits of the grain (105536).\nLaxative effects\nOats are high in fiber. Thus, they can increase stool weight and accelerate colonic transit time (12513).\nPrebiotic effects\nExploratory clinical research suggests that oats may have prebiotic effects. There is some evidence that consumption of oats increases the production of short-chain fatty acids in the gut, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Additionally, oats may increase the abundance of bacteria in the gut (107749). Further research is needed to assess these effects.\nWeight loss effects\nBeta-glucan might help control appetite by slowing stomach emptying, prolonging the feeling of fullness and stabilizing blood sugar (11135)."

Octacosanol is most commonly consumed as a constituent of policosanol. Policosanol is a mixture of long chain alcohols that contains approximately 67% octacosanol (65364).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that octacosanol has anti-inflammatory effects. In a mouse model of obesity, octacosanol inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Researchers theorize that octacosanol exerts this anti-inflammatory effect by modulating the MAPK/NF-kappa B pathway (111255).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn an animal model of obesity induced by a high-fat diet, octacosanol seems to attenuate a gain in fat and total weight and prevent the undesired metabolic consequences of obesity. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, octacosanol seems to prevent the high-fat diet-induced enlargement of the adipocytes in brown adipose tissue and inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue. Also, octacosanol seems to increase levels of proteins involved in thermogenesis, including uncoupling protein-1, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-gamma, and others in brown adipose tissue, as well as some genes involved in adaptive thermogenesis in inguinal white adipose tissue (106315). In addition, octacosanol inhibits the inflammatory processes in adipose tissue that lead to undesired metabolic consequences. Octacosanol inhibits the infiltration of macrophages and the expression of genes associated with inflammatory proteins (106315). Octacosanol also seems to prevent the development of fatty liver by a mechanism related to the suppression of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, as well as inhibiting hepatic uptake of cholesterol (106315).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that octacosanol has anti-inflammatory effects. In a mouse model of obesity, octacosanol inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Researchers theorize that octacosanol exerts this anti-inflammatory effect by modulating the MAPK/NF-kappa B pathway (111255).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human and animal research, octacosanol protected against oxidative stress (106316, 106317).\nAntiplatelet effects\nPolicosanol decreases arachidonic acid and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (2933, 2935, 2936, 2937, 2938). Policosanol 20 mg per day reduces platelet aggregation about as much as aspirin 100 mg per day (2937), but it does not seem to significantly affect coagulation time (2935, 2937). It is unclear if octacosanol is the constituent of policosanol responsible for this effect.\nCardiovascular effects\nOctacosanol is the main component of policosanol. Policosanol demonstrates a protective effect against the development of atherosclerotic lesions in animal research (65353). It is unclear if octacosanol is the constituent of policosanol responsible for this effect.\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that octacosanol might have gastroprotective effects. In a mouse model of ulcerative colitis (UC), administration of octacosanol relieved clinical symptoms of UC by preventing weight loss, inhibiting colon shortening, lowering disease activity index, and reducing inflammation of the gut barrier. Higher doses appear to be more effective. Researchers theorize that octacosanol exerts these effects by improving intestinal flora diversity, reducing inflammation by downregulating tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6, and degrading toxic compounds (111256).\nGlycemic effects\nOctacosanol appears to improve fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, plasma lipids, antioxidant status, and inflammatory response in a mouse model of obesity. Researchers theorize that octacosanol exerts these effects by regulating gut microbiota, inhibiting the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B inflammatory pathway, and reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 (111257).\nHypolipidemic effects\nOctacosanol is the main component of policosanol. Policosanol seems to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis (2934, 2939) and increasing the degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2939). It is unclear from these latter studies if octacosanol is the constituent of policosanol responsible for this effect. Further, clinical and animal studies addressing the effects of octacosanol on plasma lipids are limited and conflicting (106315, 106316, 106317, 106318, 111255).\n\nGenetic analysis suggests that octacosanol might modulate lipid metabolism signaling pathways by altering gene expression of acetyl-COA carboxylase, AMP-activated protein kinase, fatty acid synthase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, which are associated with fatty acid degradation, sphingolipid metabolism, and insulin resistance (111255). The hypolipidemic effects of octacosanol might also be related to its activity on proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The protease PCSK9 promotes degradation of the LDL receptor, playing a role in regulation of LDL levels in the blood. Statins have been shown to increase levels of PCSK9. Although octacosanol did not reduce levels of LDL cholesterol in patients given statin therapy, it did restore the positive correlation between levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol (106318).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using octacosanol for various central nervous system disorders. Even though octacosanol is not a typical component of the diet, it is present in the central nervous system (12156). In clinical research, administration of isopolicosanol or octacosanol 3.6 mg daily for seven days seems to decrease reaction time (65352)."

Peak urine levels occur approximately 4 hours after intake and return to baseline within 22 hours (100097).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOctopamine is a chemical related to norepinephrine that is derived from the amino acid tyrosine (100089, 100090, 11995). It is considered a trace amine, a type of biogenic amine found in levels of less than 1% of the total in mammalian brain regions (11995, 100094).\nAthletic performance effects\nOctopamine is used for athletic performance enhancement. However, it has not been shown to help with endurance or perceived exertion in humans. Also, a small clinical study shows that taking octopamine does not seem to help slow the heart rate or reduce levels of stress hormones or use of fat as energy (100089).\nNeurological effects\nIn mammals and other vertebrates, octopamine is found in the central nervous system, as well as peripheral tissues and plasma. It functions as part of the noradrenergic system (11995, 100094). Although no specific receptors exist, trace amine-specific receptors are present in the brain for octopamine and other trace amines. These receptors seem to signal intracellular functions and help octopamine play a role in the fine-tuning of neurotransmission as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter (100090, 100094, 100098, 100100). In animal models, octopamine seems to play a role in locomotor activity and blood pressure changes (11995). Changes in octopamine levels might also alter the pain threshold (100098).\n\nSome researchers have suggested that octopamine metabolism is altered in people with various neurological disorders. For example, octopamine levels are lower in the blood of patients with Parkinson disease or depression (100090, 100100). In contrast, platelet octopamine levels are higher in patients with migraine, especially those with migraine headaches in the absence of aura, and in those with cluster headaches (11996, 100098). Also, in patients with hepatic coma, higher octopamine levels are associated with a deeper coma, but there is no relationship with the presence or seriousness of hepatic encephalopathy (100102, 100103). The reason for these changes is not clear but might be related to a change in tyrosine metabolism (100098).\nWeight loss effects\nIn vitro, octopamine stimulates lipolysis and inhibits the uptake of glucose in animal adipocytes by acting as an agonist at the beta-3-adrenergic receptor and inhibiting the effects of insulin (11995, 100095). However, in human adipocytes, octopamine only very weakly stimulates lipolysis, and only at extremely high levels (11995, 100081, 100095). However, it stimulates glucose uptake with insulin-like properties following oxidation by monoamine oxidase and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, especially in subcutaneous adipose cells (11995, 100099). This suggests that octopamine has more than one action on adipose cells. However, it is unlikely to play a large role in weight loss associated with supplements containing octopamine and other ingredients, such as synephrine, in humans (100081, 11995)."

Oleander can also cause hyperkalemia (2532, 3495, 65419, 65435, 94429, 94436, 94437, 103239, 103241). Hyperkalemia after oleander ingestion is generally due to inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Digoxin is usually detectable by radioimmunoassay, due to the cross-reactivity between digoxin and the cardiac glycosides contained in oleander (98220).\n\nTopically, applying an oleander paste to penile and perianal ulcers has caused asymptomatic bradycardia. The paste contained oleander bark and leaves, as well as holy basil, tamarind, onion, and neem.

Other symptoms include bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiovascular collapse, complete heart block, hypotension, malignant dysrhythmias, second degree atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremia, metabolic acidosis, and death (17, 2532, 3495, 65395, 65411, 65415, 65418, 65419, 65422, 65433, 65437, 94417, 94429, 94432, 94435, 94436, 94437, 103238, 103239, 103241, 106426).\nTreatment\nTreatment of oleander toxicity involves gastric lavage, supportive care, and pharmacological management of arrhythmias (98220, 103238).

It is excreted in the urine (94429).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAll parts of the oleander plant contain cardiac glycosides. However, in yellow oleander cardiac glycosides are more concentrated in the roots and seeds (94430). The types of cardiac glycosides depend on the species of oleander. Common oleander contains oleandrin, oleandroside, folinerin, neriine, nerioside, and digitoxigenin. Yellow oleander contains thevetin A and B, thevetoxin, neriifolin, peruvoside, and ruvoside (3495, 94430, 94431, 106426).\nAnticancer effects\nOleander has been studied to treat cancer. A specific oleander extract (Anvirzel) containing the constituent oleandrin has demonstrated anti-cancer properties in vitro. This and other oleander constituents seem to have cytotoxic effects and inhibit cellular communication (65397, 65399, 65402).\nAntimicrobial effects\nConstituents of oleander are reported to have insecticidal, parasitic, and anthelmintic properties (5000, 6002).\nCardiac effects\nThe cardiac glycosides in oleander bind to sodium- and potassium-sensitive membrane-bound enzymes called ATPases and inhibit enzyme activities. This results in increased intracellular sodium and calcium ions and increased extracellular potassium levels (3477, 5000). At toxic levels, the sodium and calcium ions depolarize the cell after repolarization, causing late depolarization and increased automaticity. Severe toxicity produces bradycardia and heart block (3477).\nCNS effects\nNerizoside, delta dehydroadynerigen, neritaloside, and odoroside, isolated from common oleander, have CNS depressant activity in mice. A constituent of yellow oleander, cerebrin, is also thought to have strychnine-like actions (65420, 65440) as is rosagenin (65442)."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that there is credible evidence to support a qualified health claim stating that consuming oils high in oleic acid (at least 70% oleic acid) in quantities of 1.5 tablespoons (20 grams) daily reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. However, this evidence is supportive, not conclusive, and the statement must note that oleic acid-containing oils should not increase the total number of calories eaten in a day (98563).",

Supporting, but not conclusive, evidence suggests that consuming fats and oils rich in oleic acid might reduce the risk of CHD. However, the relationship between blood levels of oleic acid and risk of CHD is unclear.\nIn 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that replacing dietary fats and oils higher in saturated fat with oils containing at least 70% oleic acid may reduce the risk of CHD. To achieve this benefit, high-oleic acid containing oils should not increase total daily energy intake. The suggested daily dietary intake is about 20 grams (1.5 tablespoons) of high oleic acid oils in place of other fats and oils. These oils include olive oil, high-oleic acid sunflower oil, and high-oleic acid canola oil (98563). A meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that replacing 7.5% of energy from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils with high-oleic acid sunflower oil can reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 9% to 19%. Furthermore, analysis of results from observational studies suggests that replacing partially hydrogenated oil with high-oleic acid sunflower oil is associated with a 16% to 35% reduction in the risk of CHD events (95745). Clinical research in patients with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk shows that taking high-oleic acid canola oil 60 grams per 3000 kcal of energy daily as part of a fixed composition diet for 4-6 weeks reduces the Framingham 10-year CHD risk scores by 6.8% compared to baseline. However, taking the high-oleic acid canola oil is no more effective than regular canola oil, which contains approximately 62% oleic acid (26466, 101821).\n\nThe relationship between blood levels of oleic acid and risk of CHD or CVD is unclear. While some observational research suggests that having the highest blood levels of oleic acid is associated with an increased risk of CVD when compared with having the lowest blood levels of oleic acid, other research suggests an inverse association or no association at all (101832, 101834, 101838). One study suggests that having the highest blood levels of oleic acid is associated with a 1.4- to 2-fold increased risk of heart failure, other cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality (101832). In contrast, another study suggests that having the highest blood levels of oleic acid is associated with a 73% reduced risk of stroke (101838). A third study suggests no association between plasma levels of oleic acid and risk of heart failure (101834). The clinical significance of these findings is unclear, and results should not necessarily be extrapolated to dietary oleic acid (101832). While plasma oleic acid levels seem to be a weak indirect marker of moderate to high olive oil use, it is also a weak marker of butter and avian fat intake (101838). Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that plasma levels of oleic acid directly correlate with dietary oleic acid, especially where dietary oleic acid intake is relatively low (101832). As a non-essential fatty acid, oleic acid is endogenously synthesized in the liver from saturated fats (101832, 101834, 101838).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Small clinical studies suggest that consuming oils rich in oleic acid as part of the diet in place of other dietary fats may improve cholesterol levels.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia show that consuming oleic acid as part of a high-oleic acid sunflower oil- or high-oleic acid canola oil-rich diet for 3-4 weeks decreases total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by a moderate amount when compared with diets rich in palm oil, medium-chain triglycerides, or a blend of fats found in a regular Western diet (21698, 67569). Other moderate sized clinical trials in patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor show that consuming oleic acid as part of high-oleic acid canola oil for up to 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol by around 3% to 9% and LDL cholesterol by around 6% to 12% when compared with baseline or a diet higher in saturated fats. However, high-oleic acid canola oil appears to be no more effective than regular canola oil, also a source of oleic acid (26466, 101821).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for the prevention of bladder cancer.\nObservational research suggests that the highest blood levels of oleic acid are associated with a 46% lower risk of bladder cancer when compared with the lowest blood levels (101844). However, plasma oleic acid levels are only a weak indirect marker of dietary oleic acid intake. As a non-essential fatty acid, oleic acid is endogenously synthesized in the liver from saturated fats (101832, 101834, 101838). The effect of oleic acid supplementation on bladder cancer risk is unknown.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for the prevention of breast cancer.\nObservational research suggests that there is no association between dietary fatty acid intake, including oleic acid, and the risk of breast cancer (96528). The effect of oleic acid supplementation on breast cancer risk is unknown.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial in patients with depression.\nAn observational study in perimenopausal patients aged 42-52 years suggests that increasing dietary intake of oleic acid is associated with an increase in depression symptom scores. The odds ratio for depressive symptoms was approximately 2-fold higher for the highest quartile of oleic acid intake when compared with the lowest quartile (108924).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nA small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking oleic acid as part of a low-fat diet containing 15% monounsaturated fatty acids for 3 weeks does not alter levels of total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or the change in LDL oxidation when compared with taking linoleic acid as part of a low-fat diet containing 15% polyunsaturated fatty acids (101847).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial in patients with chronic diarrhea.\nA small clinical trial in patients with chronic diarrhea shows that taking oleic acid 1.6 mL or 3.2 mL before a meal reduces bowel movements over the next 24 hours by approximately 22% when compared with taking no oleic acid. Oleic acid 1.6 mL and 3.2 mL also increased intestinal transit time by around 28 minutes and 54 minutes, respectively (101848). Since the specific cause of chronic diarrhea differed among the patients included in this study, it is unclear if oleic acid is beneficial for most or only certain forms of chronic diarrhea.\nless\nDumping syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral oleic acid for dumping syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oleic acid for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nA moderate sized clinical study in patients with central obesity and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor shows that taking oleic acid as high-oleic acid canola oil for 4 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure compared to baseline (26466).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although there has been interest in using oral oleic acid for NAFLD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oleic acid for this purpose.\nObesity. Some clinical research suggests that consuming oleic acid as high-oleic acid canola oil slightly reduces abdominal fat mass and lipid levels; however, it is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity.\nA moderate sized clinical trial in patients with central obesity shows that taking oleic acid as high-oleic acid canola oil for 4 weeks reduces abdominal fat mass by approximately 0.1 kg compared to baseline (98564). Another moderate sized clinical study in patients with central adiposity and at least one other risk factor of cardiovascular disease shows that taking high-oleic acid canola oil for 6 weeks reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 3.4% and 5.6%, respectively, when compared with a control oil lower in monounsaturated fats and higher in saturated fats (101821). However, these studies also suggest that taking the high-oleic acid canola oil is no more effective than regular canola oil, also a source of oleic acid (98564, 101821). Any effect of oleic acid itself is unclear.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for the prevention of pancreatic cancer.\nMost observational research suggests no association between dietary oleic acid intake and pancreatic cancer risk. However, one large observational study suggests that the highest intake of oleic acid, at around 24 grams or more daily, is associated with a 71% lower risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with the lowest intake. The benefit is only observed in individuals with overweight or obesity (101833). The effect of oleic acid supplementation on pancreatic cancer risk is unknown.\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial in patients with short bowel syndrome.\nA small clinical trial in patients with surgical short bowel syndrome of at least 2 years shows that taking oleic acid 3.2 mL in 50 mL of a beverage daily for 3 months does not lengthen intestinal transit time, reduce diarrhea, or improve body weight when compared with placebo. In addition, energy absorption was reduced by 14% (101843).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for the prevention of stroke.\nObservational research suggests that having the highest blood levels of oleic acid is associated with a 73% lower risk of stroke when compared with the lowest blood levels of oleic acid (101838). However, plasma oleic acid levels are only a weak indirect marker of dietary oleic acid intake. As a non-essential fatty acid, oleic acid is endogenously synthesized in the liver from saturated fats (101832, 101834, 101838). The effect of oleic acid supplementation on stroke risk is unknown.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral oleic acid is beneficial for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.\nAlthough some contradictory evidence exists, a large observational study suggests that, after adjusting for dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, the highest dietary intake of oleic acid is associated with a 97% lower odds of developing ulcerative colitis when compared with the lowest intake (101846). The effect of oleic acid supplementation on ulcerative colitis risk is unknown.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate oleic acid for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOils enriched in oleic acid increase levels of oleic acid in the blood (98567, 101822, 101847).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOleic acid is a non-essential omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid. It can be produced in adequate amounts in the body from saturated fats. In the diet, oleic acid is found widely in oils and fats. The highest amounts of oleic acid are found in olive oil (70% to 80%, high oleic acid sunflower oil (79%), high oleic acid canola oil (71%), and canola oil (62%) (90681, 101821, 101824, 101830, 101832, 101845). It is also found in tree nuts and peanuts, especially high oleic acid varieties of peanuts (81% of the fat) (101822, 101823, 101825, 101837), and other high oleic acid food products including ground beef (101829).\nAnti-cancer effects\nDietary oleic acid is thought to play a role in the prevention of various types of cancer. In vitro, oleic acid has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, as well as the progression and metastasis of most investigated cell lines. Possible mechanisms of action are related to the inhibition of oncogenes such as HER-2, as well as interference in other intracellular signalling pathways (101836). Oleic acid has also been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cell lines in vitro, possibly by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species interfering with other cellular cascades (101836).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIncreased dietary oleic acid intake may be beneficial for patients with diseases involving inflammatory processes, including cardiovascular disease and ulcerative colitis. Oleic acid appears to inhibit adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells in vitro, possibly by inhibiting expression of molecules involved in this process. Oleic acid also seems to inhibit inflammatory processes in aortic endothelial cells (101837). In males, an oleic acid-rich diet reduces levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) when compared to a diet rich in palmitic acid (101827). In a meta-analysis of 31 trials, adding extra oleic acid to the diet for at least 4 weeks reduces levels of CRP, but not other inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, or soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (108925). In overweight males 18-50 years of age, supplementing a reduced-calorie diet with 56 grams daily of peanuts high in oleic acid does not reduce fasting or postprandial levels of inflammatory or oxidative stress markers when compared with the same quantity of lower oleic acid peanuts or a control (108922).\nCardiovascular effects\nCardiovascular benefits of oleic acid might be related to its effects on lipids. Human research shows that taking high-oleic acid canola oil prevents binding of LDL particles to the arterial wall (98567). High-oleic acid ground beef increases levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to low-oleic acid ground beef (101829). A possible mechanism for the reduction in LDL cholesterol levels seen is the increased expression of the liver LDL receptor as shown in animal research, as well as a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (101827).\nCognitive effects\nPreliminary research in Japanese adults 60 years and older who have normal cognitive function and are not overweight shows that dietary intake of oleic acid is positively correlated with scores on cognitive function tests (108291).\nHepatoprotective effects\nOleic acid is thought to have hepatoprotective effects. Laboratory research shows that oleic acid protects against palmitic acid-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in liver cells. In an animal model, oleic acid reverses steatohepatitis (101845).\nImmune effects\nAlthough human research is limited, in vitro and animal models show that oleic acid inhibits the proliferation and activity of T cells and natural killer cells. The mechanism of action may involve changes in lipid signaling molecules (101837).\nInsulin effects\nIncreasing the oleic acid content of the diet reduces fasting blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes (8132). Increasing dietary intake is also associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (101833). The mechanism of action may be related to an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in levels as shown in humans, and in animal and cell models (101833, 101835). In vitro, oleic acid stimulates insulin-induced activation of the receptor and glucose uptake in adipocytes (101835). Some evidence suggests that higher levels of insulin promote pancreatic cell carcinogenesis, possibly by promoting inflammatory processes in cells or by direct mechanisms on growth (101833).\nWeight loss effects\nSome, but not all, evidence suggests that oleic acid might affect body weight and body composition. Oleic acid might play a role in satiety and diet-induced thermogenesis (90681, 98589, 101823, 101825, 101830). When eaten in a meal, oleic acid promotes the production of the endocannabinoid oleoylethanolamide (OEA), which reduces subsequent energy intake (101824). Research in adults aged 18-50 years shows that using a mouth rinse containing oleic acid in skimmed milk for 30 seconds after a standardized, low-fat breakfast is associated with higher scores on a satiety scale and lower scores on a hunger scale over the subsequent 3 hours. Fatty acids such as oleic acid are thought to bind to receptors in the mouth that can trigger release of satiety hormones and slow gastric emptying (108923)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBreast cancer. Increased olive oil in the diet is linked to a reduced risk of developing breast cancer.\nMost epidemiological research has found that a higher dietary intake of olive oil is associated with a lower risk of developing breast cancer (2221, 2222, 2223, 92249, 108325).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that olive oil has modest benefit for primary prevention of CVD. However, clinical research on the use of olive oil for secondary prevention of CVD is limited and inconsistent.\nMeta-analyses and observational research suggest that higher dietary intake of olive oil (usually 20-54 grams daily) is associated with a 16% lower risk of CVD events and lower rates of CVD and overall mortality when compared with a lower dietary intake (8131, 92243, 101864, 105018, 108317, 108324, 111653). The reduced CVD risk might occur because replacing dietary saturated fats with olive oil is associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, including reduced blood pressure and cholesterol (2219, 2220, 108317). One population study suggests that replacing 10 grams daily of margarine, butter, mayonnaise, and/or dairy fat, but not vegetable oils, with the equivalent amount of olive oil is associated with a reduced risk of CVD and overall mortality (108317).\n\nIn clinical research, olive oil supplementation has been studied as a part of the Mediterranean diet, showing modest benefit, if any, for primary prevention. A non-randomized study involving nearly 7,500 patients with high cardiovascular risk shows that following a Mediterranean diet with supplemental extra virgin olive oil reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or CVD mortality, by about 30% when compared with following a low-fat Mediterranean type diet (97097). However, when clinical endpoints were analyzed separately, the Mediterranean diet with supplemental olive oil reduced only the risk of stroke by 35%; there was no significant reduction in the risk of MI, total mortality, or CVD mortality (97097, 100687). This study has been criticized for various reasons. First, the control diet used was not notably different from the Mediterranean diet apart from increased consumption of olive oil in one group. This makes it unclear whether any beneficial effects are attributable to the Mediterranean diet. It does, however, support the protective effects of olive oil itself (99509). More importantly, the original study (18241) was retracted because of serious protocol violations affecting approximately 21% of participants. These protocol violations included non-randomized enrollment and incorrect randomization. Based on these findings, the study was republished as a non-randomized trial; however, some scientists still question the controversial nature of this publication and its resulting secondary publications (101078).\n\nWith regard to secondary prevention, two studies of the Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil show inconsistent results. One large clinical study in patients with a history of MI within the last 6 months shows that following this diet for about 4 years reduces the risk of CVD mortality and non-fatal MI by 72%, and the risk of CVD mortality by 65%, when compared to usual care (100687). However, a smaller study in patients 6 weeks post-MI shows that following this diet does not significantly reduce the risk of CVD mortality, MI, heart failure, unstable angina, or stroke, when compared to following a low-fat diet (100687). Since the Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil, fruits, and vegetables, and lower in saturated fats, the specific effect of olive oil on CVD outcomes in these studies is not known.\n\nThe FDA allows a qualified health claim stating that consuming products that contain at least 70% oleic acid per serving of oil reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Olive oil and olive oil-containing products that have at least 70% oleic acid can now place this health claim on their labels (98563). The FDA also allows food labels to state that limited, but not conclusive, evidence suggests that consuming 23 grams/day (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of heart disease (12211).\nless\nConstipation. Oral olive oil can help to alleviate constipation. It is unclear if topical or rectal olive oil are beneficial for constipation in children.\nOlive oil is used as a mild laxative for reducing constipation. Based on a 2012 Consensus Statement of the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Italian Society of Colo-Rectal Surgery, olive oil can act as a stool softener when taken in adequate doses to exceed the absorptive capacity of the small intestine (16, 99301).\n\nTopical and rectal olive oil have also been investigated. In children aged 1-4 years, a small clinical trial shows that gentle massage with an ointment containing olive oil 85% for five minutes twice daily for 4 days increases stool frequency by about one per day when compared with a placebo ointment (108323). In children with severe and chronic constipation of varying causes, a retrospective study has found that use of an enema providing olive oil 1-2 mL/kg was effective for treating fecal impaction in 44% of patients and as a lubricant in 75% of patients. Efficacy was increased to 83% to 84% when the olive oil enema was followed by a glycerin enema several hours later (108318).\nless\nDiabetes. Increased consumption of olive oil in the diet seems to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Olive oil also seems to improve glycemic parameters in people with type 2 diabetes.\nMeta-analyses of clinical and observational research show that high dietary intake of olive oil for 5 to 22 years is associated with a 16% to 22% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with the lowest dietary intake (96244, 111653). This inverse association persists for doses up to 15-20 grams daily. A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that olive oil intake for 2 weeks to 4 years reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.3% and fasting plasma glucose by 6 mg/dL when compared to control. The effect of olive oil on HbA1c is similar to that of fish oil and polyunsaturated fatty acid oils, and slightly better than that of a low-fat diet (96244). One meta-analysis shows no benefit of extra virgin olive oil on glycemic indices in various populations, including those with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and other underlying conditions (108320). However, only two studies included in this analysis were specific to patients with type 2 diabetes and one of these studies used refined olive oil as a comparison group.\nless\nHypertension. Adding olive oil to the diet might help to reduce blood pressure.\nConsuming a modified diet including high amounts of extra virgin olive oil over 6 months, in conjunction with conventional treatments for hypertension, can improve blood pressure. In some cases, patients with mild to moderate hypertension can decrease doses or discontinue use of antihypertensive medications (2219, 2220, 5091).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nObesity. Oral olive oil does not seem to improve body composition, including body mass index (BMI) and body fat, in people with obesity.\nWhile some individual study results are mixed (98696, 108222), a meta-analysis of 53 clinical trials in adults shows that taking olive oil capsules 0.43-30 grams daily for up to 52 weeks or adding up to 128.5 grams of olive oil to the diet daily for up to 240 weeks does not reduce BMI or total body fat and does not alter body fat distribution when compared with placebo. Furthermore, taking olive oil capsules may increase waist circumference, and adding large amounts of olive oil to the diet long term may reduce lean mass (111654).\nless\nOtitis media. Applying olive oil drops into the ear does not seem to reduce pain in children with otitis media.\nClinical research in children with acute otitis media shows that applying olive oil drops into the ear does not seem to reduce ear pain when compared with using a preparation of antipyrine and benzocaine (Auralgan) (3276).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of developing age-related fatigue and frailty.\nPopulation research has found that consuming an average of 20 grams (3 tablespoons) of olive oil daily is associated with about a 50% reduction in the risk of developing frailty over a 3.5-year follow-up when compared with consuming an average of 12.7 grams daily. Risk was reduced by 21% for every 5 grams consumed. When olive oil types were separated, any benefit was limited to virgin, as opposed to common, olive oil (108326).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a topical mixture of olive oil, honey, and beeswax along with topical betamethasone can improve atopic dermatitis when compared with baseline (24373). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Another small clinical study in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that applying a specific olive oil and aloe vera combination product (Olivederma) twice daily for 6 weeks seems to improve symptoms to a greater degree than applying betamethasone (unknown strength) twice daily for 6 weeks (105020). This finding is limited due to significant differences in dermatitis severity between treatment groups at baseline.\nless\nBladder cancer. Although there is interest in using oral olive oil for bladder cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of olive oil for this condition.\nCancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of cancer or cancer-related mortality.\nResearch is conflicting on whether olive oil is beneficial for preventing cancer or cancer-related mortality. Some meta-analyses of available observational research have found that higher olive oil intake is associated with 31% to 34% reduced odds of developing cancer when compared with lower olive oil intake (92249, 108325). However, another meta-analysis of 10 observational and clinical studies shows no association between olive oil intake and the development of cancer (111653).\n\nIt is unclear from large population studies whether consuming olive oil is associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality (92243, 108317). One study has found that consuming high amounts of olive oil (more than 29.4 grams per 2000 kcal daily) is not associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality when compared with consuming smaller amounts of olive oil (less than 14.8 grams per 2000 kcal daily) (92243). However, another study has found a 17% reduced risk of cancer-related mortality in individuals with the highest consumption of olive oil, or at least 0.5 tablespoons or 7 grams daily, when compared with never or rarely consuming olive oil (108317). A meta-analysis of 10 studies, including those mentioned above, shows no association between olive oil intake and cancer-related mortality (111653). More studies are needed to determine the effects of olive oil on cancer-related mortality.\nless\nChylothorax. It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for reducing postoperative chylothorax.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administering olive oil 100 mL 8 hours prior to an esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell cancer reduces the incidence of postoperative chylothorax to 0%, compared to approximately 3% in those not given olive oil (101863).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if consuming olive oil in the diet is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nPopulation research has found that middle-aged females who use olive oil as their primary cooking oil may have improved verbal learning, memory, and concentration when compared with those who use other cooking oils (101858).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for improving cognitive impairment.\nA small clinical study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that adding high or moderate phenolic extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) 50 mL daily to the Mediterranean diet for 12 months modestly improves scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) when compared with baseline and when compared with following the Mediterranean diet without additional olive oil. However, there was no consistent improvement on other cognitive tests such as clock drawing, trail making, or memory recall (105024). Another small study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking EVOO or refined olive oil 30 mL daily for 6 months improves clinical dementia rating, behavioral scores, and some logical and visual memory scores when compared to baseline. Furthermore, brain imaging shows that EVOO improves brain connectivity and blood brain barrier permeability when compared to baseline, while refined olive oil does not (111652). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of colorectal cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nPopulation research has found that consuming more than 43.4 grams of olive oil daily is associated with a slightly decreased risk of developing colorectal cancer when compared with consuming only 23.4 grams daily (24370). Other population research has found that increased olive oil intake is associated with a reduction in colorectal mucosal changes and polyp formation, which are two factors involved in the development of colorectal cancer (3362). However, a meta-analysis of population research has found that there is no association between olive oil intake and colorectal cancer risk (108325).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for patients with acute respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU).\nA small clinical study in adults with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition in the ICU shows that ingesting a fat-based diet high in olive oil for 14 days increases the odds of successful ventilator weaning but does not impact other clinical outcomes including ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, or sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score when compared with control (111657). The study may be insufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for depression.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking extra virgin olive oil 25 mL daily for 52 days modestly reduces symptoms of depression in patients with severe symptoms, but not mild to moderate symptoms, when compared with sunflower oil as control (108327).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical olive oil is beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying a topical olive oil dressing in addition to standard care daily for 4 weeks improves wound healing and ulcer status as measured by degree, color, drainage, and amount of surrounding tissue healing when compared with standard care alone (111658).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Substituting olive oil for saturated fats in the diet might help to reduce cholesterol levels. However, olive oil may be less effective than other plant oils.\nObservational research and small clinical trials suggest that increasing dietary intake of olive oil in place of saturated fat may reduce total cholesterol levels (2219, 2220, 3286, 3288, 24362, 24367). However, a more recent clinical trial in obese adults shows that taking olive oil 52 mL daily for 12 weeks, alone or in addition to following a traditional Brazilian diet, does not reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared to baseline or following the traditional Brazilian diet alone (105022). Also, a meta-analysis of heterogeneous clinical research suggests that olive oil might be less effective than other plant oils for reducing total and LDL cholesterol (101862).\nless\nEarwax. It is unclear if applying olive oil into the ear is beneficial for reducing cerumen impaction.\nLimited research suggests that applying oil-based preparations, such as those containing olive oil, into the ear appears to aid with ear wax removal and irrigation when compared with not using any solution. However, oil-based preparations seem to be no better than water or saline-based preparations for aiding in earwax removal (97511).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of esophageal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of available observational research has found that higher olive oil intake is associated with 53% reduced odds of developing esophageal cancer when compared with lower olive oil intake (108325).\nless\nGallbladder disease. Although there is interest in using oral olive oil for gallbladder disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of olive for this condition.\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of gastric cancer.\nA meta-analysis of available observational research has found that higher olive oil intake is not associated with a reduced odds of developing gastric cancer when compared to lower olive oil intake (108325).\nless\nGingivitis. Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study of patients with gingivitis shows that brushing teeth daily with a toothpaste containing a combination of extra virgin olive oil, xylitol, and betaine for 4 months decreases gingival bleeding and supragingival biofilm and increases pH when compared with placebo and commercial toothpaste (111372). It is unclear if these effects are due to olive oil, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral olive oil improves Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nA small clinical study shows that taking virgin washed olive oil 30 grams each morning before breakfast for 14 days, or taking the same dose of unwashed olive oil for up to 28 days, results in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in 10% to 27% of infected patients when compared with baseline (92244). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nLaryngeal cancer. Although there is interest in using oral olive oil for laryngeal cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of olive oil for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for improving body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis shows that taking extra virgin olive oil 32 grams daily for 60 days seems to modestly reduce weight and fatty liver index, but does not improve glycemic or lipid parameters, when compared with baseline (105021). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMigraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral olive oil for migraine, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of olive for this condition.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for improving NAFLD.\nClinical research shows that in addition to a hypocaloric diet, taking olive oil 20 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces the NAFLD severity grade 2-fold and reduces body fat when compared with taking sunflower oil. There was no difference in cholesterol or liver enzymes between groups (101861).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral olive oil is beneficial for oral mucositis.\nA small clinical study in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia with chemotherapy-related oral mucositis shows that swishing then swallowing 2.5 mL of olive oil for one minute 3 times daily until healing or for 7 days reduces pain and the severity of oral mucositis when compared with control, but not as much as Manuka honey (111661). This study may have been insufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.\nPopulation research has found that a higher dietary intake of olive oil is associated with a decreased risk of developing ovarian cancer (24371).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of overall mortality.\nSome population research suggests that consuming higher amounts of olive oil is associated with reduced odds of overall mortality (92243, 108317). A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies suggests that every 25 gram increase in olive oil consumption daily is associated with an 11% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared with control groups (111653). The validity of this finding is limited by substantial heterogeneity in the included studies.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. Although there is interest in using oral olive oil for pancreatic cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of olive oil for this condition.\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if topical olive oil is beneficial for improving periodontitis symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using topical ozonated olive oil, alone or as an adjunct to scaling and root planing, for 8 weeks improves symptoms of periodontitis, such as plaque index, gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, and probing pocket depth, when compared to scaling and root planing alone or to topical chlorhexidine gel. Bacterial counts are also improved (92248).\nless\nPharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of pharyngeal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of available observational research has found that higher olive oil intake is not associated with a reduced odds of developing nasopharyngeal or oral/pharyngeal cancer when compared with lower olive oil intake (108325).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if topical olive oil reduces postoperative pain.\nA small clinical trial in patients following a Caesarian section shows that topical application with a cream containing virgin olive oil 2% twice daily on postoperative days 2-10 modestly reduces postoperative pain when compared with a placebo cream or no cream (108328).\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical olive oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of pressure ulcers.\nA small clinical study in hospitalized patients with stage 1 pressure ulcers shows that rubbing the affected area with 15 mL of olive oil for 30 minutes daily for 7 days seems to reduce the ulcer area when compared with standard treatment alone (105019). The validity of this study is limited because patients in the control group had larger ulcers at baseline.\n\nOlive oil has also been evaluated for the prevention of pressure ulcers. A meta-analysis of 4 studies in patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers shows that applying olive oil reduces the risk of pressure ulcers by 44% when compared with control groups, with a greater effect in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (111655). However, a small clinical study in hospitalized and immobile patients shows that applying olive oil dressing once daily for 7 days does not seem to prevent the development of pressure ulcers when compared with using fish oil dressing (102392). The duration of this study may have been too short to identify an effect.\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral olive oil reduces the risk of prostate cancer.\nA meta-analysis of available observational research has found that higher olive oil intake is associated with a 39% reduced odds of developing prostate cancer when compared with lower olive oil intake (108325).\nless\nPsoriasis. Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a topical mixture of olive oil, honey, and beeswax along with topical clobetasol can improve psoriasis when compared with pretreatment (24373).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical olive oil is beneficial for preventing radiation dermatitis.\nA meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in adults with breast and nasopharyngeal cancer shows that applying olive oil to the affected area 2-3 times daily for 2 weeks reduces the incidence of severe radiation dermatitis but not mild radiation dermatitis when compared with control (110325). However, the included studies are limited by a lack of blinding, questionable methodological quality, and a high risk of bias.\nless\nStroke. Oral olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with the Mediterranean diet; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA nonrandomized clinical study in adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease shows that following a Mediterranean diet with supplemental extra virgin olive oil reduces the risk of stroke by 35% when compared with following a low-fat Mediterranean diet (97097, 100687). Also, observational research in European populations has found that a dietary intake of olive oil of 20 grams to less than 30 grams daily is associated with a 20% reduced risk of stroke when compared with a dietary intake of less than 10 grams. Higher intakes of olive oil do not appear to provide additional benefit (108324).\nless\nTinea corporis. Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a topical mixture of olive oil, honey, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks is effective for improving and curing tinea corporis when compared to baseline (24372). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nTinea cruris. Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a topical mixture of olive oil, honey, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks is effective for improving and curing tinea cruris when compared to baseline (24372). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nTinea versicolor. Topical olive oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a topical mixture of olive oil, honey, and beeswax three times daily for 4 weeks is effective for improving and curing tinea versicolor when compared to baseline (24372). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical olive oil improves surgical wound healing.\nA small clinical trial in patients following a Caesarian section shows that topical application with a cream containing virgin olive oil 2% twice daily on postoperative days 2-10 modestly improves wound healing when compared with a placebo cream or no cream (108328).\nless\nStretch marks (striae gravidarum). It is unclear if topical olive oil is beneficial for improving stretch marks.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that gently applying olive oil 1 mL twice daily to the abdomen from 18-20 weeks of gestation does not reduce the incidence or severity of stretch marks during the second trimester of pregnancy or at term when compared with not applying any oil or cream (92250, 92251).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of olive oil for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nConjugated metabolites of hydroxytyrosol appear to be the main phenolics in the plasma following consumption of virgin olive oil. Other constituents found in plasma include tyrosol and oleuropein aglycone (92246, 108321). In healthy volunteers, ingestion of olive oil enriched with oleanolic acid and maslinic acid takes 3-4 hours to reach the maximum concentration of these compounds (105017). Some research shows that consuming extra virgin olive oil results in increases in plasma levels of oleic acid (108319).\nExcretion\nConjugated metabolites of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol are found in the urine following consumption of virgin olive oil (92246). The olive oil terpenes, maslinic acid and oleanolic acid, have a half-life of about 1.4-2.3 hours (105017).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOlive oil is the oil of the olive fruit. Olive oil contains the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (56% to 83%), palmitic acid (8% to 20%), and linoleic acid (4% to 20%) (2224, 12211, 108319, 108321). Olive oil is classified, in part, according to fatty acid content, measured as free oleic acid. Extra virgin olive oil contains a maximum of 1% free oleic acid, virgin olive oil contains 2%, and ordinary olive oil contains 3.3%. Unrefined olive oils with more than 3.3% free oleic acid are considered \"unfit for human consumption\" (3273). Olive oil also contains phenolics, including hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol conjugates, oleuropein, ligstroside, and others (108321).\nAnti-cancer effects\nSome researchers think olive oil might have a role in preventing colon cancer. Consumption of olive oil seems to reduce production of deoxycholic acid, a bile acid thought to be involved in the development of mucosal changes and polyp formation preceding colorectal cancer (3362).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nOlive oil might have anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid concentrations and increasing anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid concentrations. The metabolites of oleic acid, an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid, in olive oil seem to competitively inhibit the production of inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Oleic acid metabolites might also suppress production of inflammatory cytokines (3454, 105018). However, in some human research, taking olive oil did not reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (108322).\n\nOlive oil also contains oleocanthal, which might be responsible for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of olive oil. This compound shares some pharmacological properties with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Oleocanthal inhibits both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 but it does not inhibit lipoxygenase. Extra virgin olive oil provides about 200 mcg of oleocanthal/mL of olive oil. It is thought that about 60% to 90% of oleocanthal is absorbed after ingestion (13186).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn obese and non-obese adults, taking a single dose of extra virgin olive oil 25 mL reduces serum levels of acylated ghrelin and increases serum levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In addition, there were modest beneficial effects on postprandial levels of insulin, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. These changes did not occur when common olive oil was consumed (108321).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, olive oil has antimicrobial effects against Helicobacter pylori (92244).\nCardioprotective effects\nPeople use olive oil to prevent cardiovascular disease and atherogenesis because it seems to lower certain cardiac risk factors (2219, 2220, 2224, 10673). Phenolic compounds present in olive oil seem to possess antioxidant, vasodilating, and antiplatelet properties. The compounds act as free radical scavengers, inhibiting platelet aggregation and thromboxane release (10673). Olive oil seems to increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol resistance to oxidation and therefore possibly decreases its contribution to atherogenesis (2219, 2220, 2224). It also seems to improve the function of endothelial tissue in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Olive oil seems to lower blood pressure and decrease postprandial factor VII clotting activity (8131). Preliminary research suggests olive oil might reduce aortic wall thickness in hypertensive animals; however, this occurs to a lesser extent than with fish oils (14040). Olive oil also seems to modestly reduce cardiomyocyte death, which increases in left ventricular hypertrophy (14039).\nHematologic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that a phenol component of olive oil has antiplatelet effects (24365). However, clinical research in healthy patients and patients on dialysis suggests that taking olive oil might not affect platelet aggregation (65646, 66272)."

    "Omega-6 Fatty Acids": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Omega-6 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids with the first carbon-carbon double bond in the sixth carbon position. This family includes the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (18:2n-6) found in many vegetable oils, gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n-6) found in evening primrose seed, borage, and black currant seed oils, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) found mainly in animal fats and fish (7701, 23723).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts found in foods. Dietary intake in amounts of 5% to 10% of daily calories are appropriate according to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) (23723).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of omega-6 fatty acids when used orally in medicinal amounts.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when consumed by children over the age of 12 months as part of the diet in amounts between 5% to 10% of daily calories according to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) (23723).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed as part of the diet in amounts between 5% and 10% of daily calories according to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) (23723).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids are consumed in the diet. Population research suggests that the highest maternal intakes of omega-6 fatty acids (15.2-47.6 grams or 137-428 kcal daily) during pregnancy is associated with a 2.4-times greater odds of giving birth to an infant below the 10th percentile for birth weight when compared with the lowest maternal intakes (0.4-5.7 grams daily) (96913). In addition, population research in women with a history of atopy suggests that the highest blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids during the second trimester is associated with an increased odds of having a child develop atopic dermatitis by age 4-6 years when compared with the lowest intakes (103309). There is insufficient reliable information available about supplemental omega-6 fatty acids; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, consuming omega-6 fatty acids in amounts found in foods is well tolerated.\nCardiovascular\nDietary intake of the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid in amounts of 5% to 10% of daily calories is appropriate according to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) (23723). However, higher intake levels, especially when compared with omega-3 fatty acid intake, might be detrimental. For example, a higher ratio of dietary omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is thought to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease compared to a lower ratio (66678). However, the American Heart Association Nutrition Subcommittee of the Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism, the Council on Cardiovascular Nursing, and the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, suggest that reduction of omega-6 fatty acids in the diet is unlikely to be beneficial for the cardiovascular system if replaced with saturated or trans-fatty acids (66692). Population research has found that higher intake of omega-6 fatty acids might be associated with hypertension and increased levels of plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis (65498, 66640, 66642).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn epidemiological research, increased intake of omega-6 fatty acids was associated with elevated risk of fracture in the elderly (66662).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIn epidemiological research, an increased dietary ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with an elevated risk of having a sleep disorder (107001).\nless\nOncologic\nSome population research has found that high omega-6 fatty acid intake or blood levels are associated with an increased risk for cancer, including breast cancer and prostate cancer (3508, 7824, 66660, 66664, 66729).\nless\nPsychiatric\nIn epidemiological research, adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had higher levels of omega-6 and lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cells (48200). The role of omega-6 fatty acids in ADHD is unclear; it is possible that the low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and essential fatty acids in general may be playing a role. Also, higher levels of some omega-6 fatty acids in the body are associated with greater depressive symptomology and neuroticism (65815, 66659). Higher concentrations of some omega-6 fatty acids in red blood cells of patients with schizophrenia are correlated with positive schizotypal trait measures in healthy adults (66635). This may be related to increased intake of omega-6 fatty acids in the diet of patients with schizophrenia (96916).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most research suggests that increasing dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids does not reduce the risk of CVD.\nA meta-analysis including 19 low-quality randomized controlled trials that followed patients for 1-8 years shows that higher intake of omega-6 fatty acids for at least 12 months does not reduce the risk of primary or secondary CVD events, coronary heart disease (CHD) events, stroke, or all-cause or CVD mortality when compared with a lower intake. The intake of omega-6 fatty acids ranged from 0.8% to 20.6% of energy (99973). Population research conducted over about 7.3 years has also found that baseline red blood cell omega-6 fatty acid levels are not associated with CVD events, CHD events, ischemic strokes, CVD deaths, or all-cause mortality (99974), and red blood cell omega-6 fatty acid levels do not differ between people with or without coronary artery disease in patients hospitalized for coronary angiography (96918).\n\nHowever, some research suggests that individual omega-6 fatty acids may have differing effects in the body. One population study has found that increased levels of shorter chain omega-6 fatty acids in red blood cells, including linoleic acid, gamma linolenic acid, and dihomo-gamma linolenic acid, are associated with a reduced risk of CVD mortality. Higher levels of the longer chain omega-6 fatty acids adrenic acid and docosapentaenoic acid are associated with a moderately increased risk of overall mortality in these patients (96918). Higher quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nChild development. Most research suggests that supplementing infant formula with arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, does not improve infant or child development.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that inclusion of arachidonic acid in infant formula at levels of up to 0.84% of fatty acids, in addition to DHA, for 2-12 months does not improve visual or neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm or full-term infants up to 18 months of age (96919, 96920). Also, giving infants DHA- and arachidonic acid-supplemented formula during infancy does not appear to improve neurodevelopment by the age of 6 years (92503).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Increasing dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids does not seem to lower plasma cholesterol or triglyceride levels.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that increasing intake of omega-6 fatty acids, specifically linoleic acid or gamma-linolenic acid, by replacing dietary saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids modestly reduces levels of total cholesterol. However, the clinical significance is unclear. Also, increasing intake of omega-6 fatty acids does not seem to affect levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides (99973).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Most research suggests that taking omega-6 fatty acids is not beneficial for MS.\nA meta-analysis of the available literature shows that taking omega-6 fatty acids, mainly as linoleic acid, does not seem to prevent disease progression in relapsing-remitting MS patients or chronic progressive MS patients at 24 months (107318).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if increased dietary omega-6 fatty acid intake is beneficial for preventing age-related cognitive decline.\nPopulation research has found that the highest blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids during middle age are associated with the best overall cognitive functioning 13 years later when compared with lower intakes (99979). In addition, the highest tertile of omega-6 fatty acid intake in older adults, at least 8.8 mg per kcal daily, is inversely associated with having low cognitive performance. However, the same pattern was observed for the highest tertile of omega-3 fatty acids, and the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio in the diet had no overall association with cognitive performance (103308).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral omega-6 fatty acids have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids twice daily for 3-6 months does not improve symptoms of ADHD in most children when compared with placebo, although it may improve ADHD symptoms in a subgroup of children with ADHD inattentive subtype plus comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (65864).\nless\nBlepharitis. It is unclear if oral omega-6 fatty acids are beneficial for blepharitis.\nOne preliminary clinical study in patients with Meibomian gland dysfunction shows that taking a specific product (Medilar, Fidia Oftal Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals), which contains the omega-6 fatty acids linoleic acid 28.5 mg and gamma-linolenic acid 15 mg, once daily for 180 days in combination with eyelid hygiene can improve cloudiness from eye secretions and gland obstruction when compared with baseline (66665). However, the lack of a control group limits the validity of these results. Population research involving postmenopausal adults has also found that moderate dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with a reduced risk of developing Meibomian gland dysfunction. However, high intake was not associated with a reduced risk in these patients, and the protective effect of omega-6 fatty acids, if any, in the general population is unclear (99978). Higher quality research is needed to confirm these results.\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if increased dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial for cancer prevention.\nIn a meta-analysis of clinical research, increasing intake of dietary omega-6 fatty acids does not seem to reduce cancer risk or mortality. However, the included research is of low quality (107005). Also, a meta-analysis of population research has found that dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is not associated with cancer risk. However, high blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids were associated with an 8% reduced risk of cancer when compared to low blood levels, with breast cancer carrying the strongest association. Each 5% increase in blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids was associated with a 2% decreased cancer risk (107006). These results should be interpreted with caution, since factors other than omega-6 fatty acid intake, such as alcohol intake or overall diet, may affect blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids (100516).\nless\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral omega-6 fatty acids have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids for 3 months can improve reading, spelling, and behavior, but not motor skills, when compared with placebo in children with DCD (13748).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if higher dietary or supplemental intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes.\nPopulation research has found that the highest blood levels of the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid are associated with a 43% reduced risk of developing diabetes over a period of 5-42 years when compared with the lowest blood levels. Blood levels of another omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid, do not seem to be linked to diabetes risk (96914). These results should be interpreted with caution, since factors other than omega-6 fatty acid intake, such as alcohol intake or overall diet, may affect blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids (100516). In addition, a meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research does not support any benefit of omega-6 fatty acids in the prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes (101504).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if formula supplemented with arachidonic acid is beneficial for diarrhea prevention in infancy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that infant formula supplemented with arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, 17 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) can reduce the incidence of diarrhea in the first year of life when compared with non-supplemented infant formula (92505).\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial for dry eye prevention.\nPopulation research has found that higher intake of dietary omega-6 fatty acids is not associated with a reduced risk of dry eye after menopause (99978).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial for blood pressure reduction.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids, especially linoleic acid, is inversely associated with the odds of hypertension in non-diabetic individuals. However, in patients with diabetes, higher intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with an increased odds of hypertension (99975).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is beneficial for NAFLD prevention.\nCross-sectional population research is mixed with respect to dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids in patients with NAFLD when compared with healthy controls. One large cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2007-2014 has found that consuming omega-6 fatty acids at a dose of at least 250 mg/kg daily is associated with an 82% reduced risk of having NAFLD when compared with consuming less than 121.3 mg/kg daily (107002).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral omega-6 fatty acids are beneficial for reducing cholesterol or triglyceride levels in adults with obesity.\nIn individuals with abdominal obesity, a small clinical trial shows that taking linoleic acid 15 grams (females) or 20 grams (males) (Pharmatech AS) daily for 7 weeks from safflower oil has modest beneficial effects on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-, and total cholesterol when compared with baseline or taking fish oil. However, there was no effect on triglyceride levels (107003).\nless\nPhotoreactive keratectomy. Oral omega-6 fatty acids have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients who have undergone photoreactive keratectomy shows that taking a tablet containing the omega-6 fatty acids linoleic acid and gamma-linolenic acid, as well as beta-carotene, B vitamins, and trace minerals, daily for 30 days can improve tear production and eye healing when compared with a control group (66679).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if supplementing infant formula with arachidonic acid is beneficial for preventing respiratory tract infections.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that infant formula supplemented with arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal and docosahexaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) 17 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) can reduce the incidence of respiratory illness in the first year of life when compared with non-supplemented infant formula (92505).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate omega-6 fatty acids for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with omega-6 fatty acids",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOmega-6 fatty acids are digested along with other dietary fat. The fatty acids are packaged into chylomicrons and absorbed into the lymph before entering the circulation (23723, 66700).\nDistribution\nOmega-6 fatty acids enter the circulation in chylomicrons. Enzymes in the blood remove the omega-6 fatty acids from triglycerides within the chylomicrons to allow uptake into various cells of the body (23723, 66700, 107003). Omega-6 fatty acids are constituents of all cell membranes in the body.\nMetabolism\nOnce taken up by cells, omega-6 fatty acids are metabolized by enzymes that increase their length and unsaturation. Therefore, inIake of linoleic acid (18:2n-6) is metabolized to 20- or 22-carbon omega-6 fatty acids with 3 or more double bonds, such as 20:4n-6 and 22:4n-6. The common elongation and desaturation pathway of omega-6 fatty acids involves elongation by elongases and desaturation by desaturases (23723, 66700).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOmega-6 fatty acids are a family of fatty acids with the first double bond six carbons from the methyl end. Linoleic acid (18:2n-6) is a fatty acid 18 carbons in length with two double bonds. Linoleic acid is one of two fatty acids considered essential in the human body. The other is the omega-3 fatty acid 18:3n-3. Linoleic acid may be metabolized to other fatty acids, including but not limited to gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6), and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) (23723). In foods, linoleic acid is found in vegetable oils, including corn, evening primrose seed, safflower, and soybean oils. Gamma-linolenic acid is found in evening primrose seed, borage, and black currant seed oils. Arachidonic acid is found mainly in animal fats and fish (7701, 23723).\n\nOmega-6 fatty acids are components of cell membrane structures and play a role in cell signaling pathways and function (11120). Some omega-6 fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid, are converted to eicosanoids and other cellular mediators, with both positive and negative effects in the body (66645, 66678). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, make up a third of all lipids in the brain' grey matter (425). Arachidonic acid is essential for brain function, growth, and development. There is interest in the relationship between dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids or blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids and disease development. Lower blood levels of omega-6 fatty acids have been found in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis, HIV, cystic fibrosis, liver injury, and atopic dermatitis (65827, 66637, 66711, 66725, 66737). In general, the clinical effects of increasing omega-6 fatty acids in these patients is not known.\nAnticancer effects\nAlthough the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid has pro-cancer effects in laboratory models (66648), omega-6 fatty acids have also been shown to have anticancer effects (66611, 66669). Population research has not confirmed a relationship between omega-6 fatty acid intake and cancer risk in humans (107005, 107006).\nBlood pressure effects\nMetabolites of the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid are involved in the regulation of blood pressure. These metabolites may have differing and opposing effects, with some inducing vasodilation and blood pressure reduction, and others causing vasoconstriction. Population research has found an association between intake of omega-6 fatty acids and prevalence of hypertension in patients with diabetes, but not in those without diabetes (99975).\nCardiovascular effects\nOmega-6 fatty acids are generally considered to be harmful to the cardiovascular system. In fact, omega-6 fatty acid-rich oils are commonly used as the placebo or control in animal and human studies investigating the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids. However, omega-6 fatty acids are commonly found in vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds and considered to be heart healthy compared with saturated and trans-fatty acids. It is thought that, in North America, people consume enough omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, as linoleic acid is commonly found in cooking oils and salad dressings. The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 levels in the diet have increased over the past 100 years. The Institute of Medicine recommends that 5% to 10% of calories should come from omega-6 fatty acids, as linoleic acid. Overall, there is little evidence suggesting that reducing omega-6 intake is associated with reduced inflammation in the body (66692).\nPulmonary effects\nHigher dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with increased dyspnea and reduced lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (96917). In vitro, the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid induced the release of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators in pulmonary fibroblasts. The mechanism of action is only partially related to cyclooxygenase-related pathways (99976, 99977). However, when pulmonary fibroblasts are taken from individuals with COPD, arachidonic acid is less inflammatory than when pulmonary fibroblasts are taken from individuals without COPD (99976). The reason for this is unclear."

Stomach distress from onion powder appears to be transient (104772). In one case report, consumption of raw onions led to esophageal spasm (66841).\nless\nImmunologic\nAllergy to onion is rare, although there are reports of symptoms to both oral and topical exposure (41752, 101743). In one case, oral exposure or the aroma of onions caused the sensation of throat closing in an allergic woman (88404). In a 35-year-old man, cooked onion ingestion triggered anaphylaxis (101742). In another case, the smell of onion was identified as a trigger for migraines in a 32-year-old female.

Clinical research in adults and children shows that topical application of onion extract, often as part of combination products, for 10 weeks to 6 months is beneficial for preventing scarring; however, the most effective combination of ingredients, dosage form, and dose are unclear.\nMany small clinical trials show that using topical onion extract improves the appearance, as well as pain and itching, associated with postburn hypertrophic scars, keloidal scars, scars following tattoo removal, scars following Cesarean delivery, or scars following surgical removal of tissue when compared with control (66895, 66918, 66939, 66951, 66987, 67089, 67104, 95151, 95156, 95159, 104773). Products evaluated in clinical research have included gels containing a combination of onion extract, heparin, and allantoin (Contractubex, Merz Pharmaceuticals) (66895, 66987, 67089, 67104, 104773); a combination of onion extract and a silicone derivative (Cybele scagel, Bangkok Botanica) (95156, 95159); a combination of onion extract, allantoin, pentaglycan, and a solution of glycosaminoglycans (Kaloidon gel, Laboratori Farmacologici Milanesi) (95151); and a transdermal patch containing a combination of onion extract and allantoin (104771).\n\nHowever, not all research agrees. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using onion extract gel for scar management demonstrated mixed results when compared with control. However, the validity of the study is limited by high heterogeneity (109511). In addition, a specific product containing onion extract and allantoin (Mederma, Merz Pharmaceuticals) for 4-11 weeks does not appear to improve the appearance of new surgical scars (66742, 66883). Similarly, observational research has found that a topical patch containing onion extract and allantoin is not associated with improved provider- or patient-assessed appearance of scars following cesarean-delivery after 4 weeks when compared with those using no scar treatment (104771). It is possible that the duration of treatment in these studies was inadequate to identify improvement.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nObesity. Clinical research does not support the use of dietary onion or onion supplements for weight loss.\nClinical research in overweight patients shows that taking capsules containing steamed onion (Oniro, Kunpoong Bio Co., Ltd) 300 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body mass index (BMI), fat distribution, or fat mass when compared with placebo (101747). In addition, one clinical study in overweight and obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that eating raw red onion 80-120 grams daily can actually increase BMI by 0.36 kg/m2 when compared with eating 20-30 grams of raw red onion (95155).\n\nClinical studies have also used onion products standardized by quercetin content. Preliminary clinical research in overweight and obese patients shows that taking onion peel extract providing quercetin 100 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by up to 1.1 kg and BMI by up to 0.4 kg/m2 when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (95152, 101748). Another small clinical study in healthy, overweight Japanese adults shows that taking an onion powder containing quercetin 60 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, or abdominal fat when compared with the same quantity of quercetin-free onion powder (104772).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlopecia areata.

In vitro research shows that onion consumption inhibits platelet aggregation (19, 66898) and taking onion may reduce blood sugar levels (19, 66800, 66812, 66859, 66982, 67033, 67043, 67053, 67072, 95148, 95160). Tell patients to discontinue using medicinal amounts of onion at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with onion.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, intake of onion products containing quercetin, increased quercetin levels in the blood (1999, 37291, 67120, 95150). Maximum levels occur between 0.7-3 hours after intake (37291, 66894, 67120, 67131, 95150). Quercetin glycosides from onions are better absorbed than pure quercetin aglycone (66745, 66750, 67111, 67121). Absorption of quercetin glycosides from onion was approximately 52% (67111).\nMetabolism\nQuercetin glycosides appeared to be hydrolyzed in the intestine to the aglycones (9443). In the plasma, quercetin is found as conjugates such as quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3'-sulfate, and isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, following consumption of onions and metabolism in the liver (66762, 66894, 67121, 67131).\nExcretion\nIn human research, the elimination half-life of quercetin from onion was 28 hours (67120). Following intake of quercetin in onion, metabolites are excreted in urine (36597, 66856, 66894, 67131).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the onion is the bulb. Onion contains essential oils (2). The main constituents of interest are the di-and tri-sulfide compounds and flavonoids (95148). Quercetin is one flavonoid that is found in high levels in the red skin of onions. Related compounds are found in white onion (95148). Plant sterols are also found in onion (95148). The distinct flavor of onion is due to derivatives of cysteine sulfoxide (51332). Cooking seems to alter the flavonoid content of onions. Boiling, sautéing, and steaming were found to reduce flavonoid content (66772).\nAntiasthma effects\nOnion is traditionally used to reduce symptoms of asthma and other respiratory disorders. In animal research, some onion extracts or onion oil have displayed protective effects on bronchial asthma (67019, 67025, 67036, 67076). The thiosulfinates and isothiocyanates found in onion may be responsible for the antiasthmatic effects (67019, 67025, 67076). These constituents have been found to inhibit enzymes such as 5-lipoxygenease and cyclooxygenase, which promote the production of inflammatory mediators, as well as histamine release (67009, 67019).\nAnticancer effects\nConsuming onion in the diet is thought to reduce the risk of cancer (51341, 51460, 66844, 66849, 67125). Based on laboratory research, the main constituents of interest include the organosulfur compounds (51496, 66788, 67018) and quercetin (66896, 66977). Quercetin has been shown to stimulate macrophage phagocytosis and natural killer cell activity in an animal model (66977). In cancer cells, quercetin has been shown to induce apoptosis (66886, 66896). In healthy women, a meal including fried onions increased resistance of lymphocyte DNA to strand breakage, possibly protecting against mutagenic effects (66762).\nAntidiabetic effects\nHypoglycemic effects of onion have been shown in patients with diabetes, in people without diabetes, and in animal models (66800, 67033, 67072, 95148, 95160). Laboratory research suggests that the hypoglycemic effects of onion may be dependent on the stimulation of insulin secretions or insulin sparing activity (66767, 66806, 95148). Antioxidant activity of onion constituents also seems to play a role (66806, 66812, 95148). Flavonoids such as quercetin, and sulfur-containing constituents, are involved (95148).\nAntihypertensive effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that some products containing onion decrease systolic blood pressure by a small amount (66766, 95149). Although the mechanisms of action are not clear, the antioxidant effects of quercetin and other flavonoids seem to play a role (66813, 66891, 66955).\nAntimicrobial\nOnion has antibacterial and antifungal effects in vitro. Antibacterial effects have been exhibited against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli (67054, 67079, 67087, 67118). Onion has displayed antifungal activity against species of Candida, Malassezia, Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, and Trichophyton. Antifungal effects included both inhibition of mycelial growth and reducing the production of aflatoxin (43653, 57665, 66832, 66892, 67087, 67130).\nBone effects\nOnion might promote bone health. Women who consumed onion daily were found to have increased bone density compared to those who consumed onion once a month or less (66967). In animal research, ingestion of onion significantly reduced bone loss and inhibited bone resorption (66933). The constituent quercetin seems to play a role. In animal study, quercetin was found to inhibit bone loss and increase new bone formation (66932, 66979, 66980).\nCoagulation effects\nPlatelet aggregation is inhibited in vitro following consumption of onion by humans (19, 66898). Onion constituents seem to reduce the formation of inflammatory products from arachidonic acid in platelets (66754, 66794). The organosulfur compounds have also been found to have fibrinolytic potential and antiplatelet activity (66776, 66778, 67106). However, these effects are not necessarily shown in clinical research following consumption of raw onion (1999, 7622).\nDigestive effects\nOnion is traditionally used as an antiflatulent and to prevent dyspepsia. In animal research, onion was found to stimulate digestive enzymes, such as chymotrypsin and intestinal disaccharidases (67135). In vitro, onion enhanced the activity of pancreatic lipase and amylase (46178).\nLipid effects\nOnion has been shown to have hypolipidemic effects in both animal models and adults with normal cholesterol levels (66906, 67044, 67117, 95148, 95155). The main active constituents seemed to be sulfur-containing compounds, such as mainly S-propyl cysteine and the disulfides (66902, 67088).\nWound-healing effects\nOnion extract, alone or in combination with other products, has been shown to improve the look of scars (66895, 66918, 66939, 66951, 66987, 67089, 67104, 95156, 95159). Constituents of interest include flavonoids such as quercetin and kaempferol, which have been studied in laboratory models (66996). Anti-inflammatory effects and antiproliferative effects on fibroblasts are involved, possibly by reducing inflammatory cytokines or cyclooxygenase products. Other mechanisms of action likely include anti-bacterial and collagen down-regulatory properties (66795, 67014, 95151, 95154, 95156)."

    "Oolong Tea": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Oolong tea is made from Camellia sinensis, a woody plant from which a variety of teas, including green tea and black tea, are produced (4218, 89481). Oolong tea is fermented for longer than green tea but for less time than black tea (4218, 94077). It is largely produced and consumed in China (94079).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts (12518, 104785). Oolong tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 4 cups of tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when consumed as a beverage in large quantities. Oolong tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg per day, or approximately 4 cups of tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances (11832). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated oolong tea.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages (11833).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of oolong tea, mothers should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). Use of caffeine in pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 16014).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from oolong tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). In a cohort of mother/infant pairs with a median maternal plasma caffeine level of 168.5 ng/mL (range 29.5-650.5 ng/mL) during pregnancy, birth weights and lengths were lower in the 4th quartile of caffeine intake compared with the 1st. By age 7, heights and weights were lower by 1.5 cm and 1.1 kg respectively. In another cohort of mother/infant pairs with higher maternal pregnancy plasma caffeine levels, median 625.5 ng/mL (range 86.2 to 1994.7 ng/mL), heights at age 8 were 2.2 cm lower, but there was no difference in weights (109846).\nPREGNANCY: In some studies, consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy adults can safely consume doses up to 300 mg daily during pregnancy without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine found in about 3 cups of tea. There is also some evidence to suggest that a component found in oolong tea may inhibit folate metabolism and decrease folic acid concentrations during pregnancy. Folic acid levels should be monitored closely (94078).\nPREGNANCY: Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of oolong tea, caffeine intake should be closely monitored. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of oolong tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants (6026). Large doses or excessive intake of oolong tea should be avoided during lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, oolong tea is well tolerated when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Many of the adverse effects of oolong tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and tremors.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Many of the serious adverse effects of oolong tea can be attributed to its caffeine content, such as arrhythmia, chest pain, convulsions, delirium, premature heartbeat, and respiratory alkalosis.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, oolong tea can cause some cardiovascular-related adverse effects. Some of these effects may be due to the caffeine content of oolong tea. Acute oral administration of caffeine can cause increased blood pressure, but regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722). Also, epidemiological research suggests that there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension (13739). Epidemiological research also suggests that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day, or approximately 4 cups of tea, is not associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453), or cardiovascular disease in general (37805, 98806).\n\nHowever, due to its caffeine content, oolong tea may cause other adverse cardiovascular effects when used orally. These effects include tachycardia, tachypnea, chest pain, premature heartbeat, arrhythmia, and hypertension (11832, 11838, 13735). Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia (13734).\n\nCombining ephedra with caffeine can increase the risk of adverse effects. Jitteriness, hypertension, seizures, temporary loss of consciousness, and hospitalization requiring life support has been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729). There is also a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed ephedra 40-60 mg, creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for six weeks (1275).\nless\nEndocrine\nOolong tea contains caffeine. Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis (13734).\n\nSome evidence has found that caffeine is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis in women (8043). However, a population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study suggests that there is no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies suggests that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807). Restricting caffeine in women with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). In infants, tea may cause microcytic anemia (631).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nThe caffeine in oolong tea may cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation in infants (6023).\nless\nImmunologic\nOolong tea contains caffeine. Caffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOolong tea contains caffeine. Some epidemiological research has found that caffeine may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, but conflicting evidence exists. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Women identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake of less than 400 mg per day, or about 4 cups of tea, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal women with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317, 98806).\n\nSome researchers believe that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as muscle tension and muscle pains. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOolong tea contains caffeine. Orally, caffeine can cause insomnia, nervousness, headache, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, restlessness, ringing in the ears, tremors, delirium, and convulsions (10755, 11832, 11838, 13735). Caffeine may also exacerbate sleep disturbances in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10204).\n\nThere is some concern that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as headache, tiredness and fatigue, drowsiness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness(13738). Other symptoms such as delirium, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOolong tea contains caffeine. Caffeine may cause tachypnea-induced respiratory alkalosis (11832, 11838, 13735). Some researchers think that stopping regular use of caffeine may cause withdrawal symptoms such as runny nose. However, this symptom may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects (2723, 11839)\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nMental alertness. Consumption of caffeine-containing beverages, such as oolong tea, can improve or attenuate declines in mental alertness and cognitive capacity.\nClinical research shows that consuming caffeinated beverages has positive effects on mental alertness. Some small clinical studies show that consuming caffeinated tea throughout the day prevents a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when compared with water (4221, 4224). Another small clinical study shows that combining caffeine with glucose as an \"energy drink\" improves mental performance when compared with placebo, caffeine alone, or glucose alone (13732).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nA small clinical study in adults with recalcitrant atopic dermatitis shows that drinking oolong tea 333 mL three times daily improves symptoms in 64% of patients when compared to baseline. The beneficial effects may appear within 1-2 weeks of initiation of treatment (12520). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial in children with autism spectrum disorder.\nA very small clinical study in children with autism spectrum disorder shows that consuming a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-rich oolong tea 1200 mL daily for 2 weeks improves manual dexterity, balance, and sensory profile by small to moderate amounts when compared with an herbal tea containing about half the amount of natural GABA. There was no benefit on sleep (102762). It is unclear if any benefits are due to oolong tea, GABA, or the combination.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there has been interest in using oral oolong tea for prevention of CVD or CVD-related events, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oolong tea for this purpose.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oolong tea is associated with a reduced risk of COPD.\nOne prospective, observational study in older adults has found that consumption of at least 3 cups daily of tea, including black tea, oolong tea, and green tea, is associated with a 23% reduced risk of COPD prevalence and a 65% reduced risk of developing COPD in models adjusted for potential confounders when compared with the lowest tea consumption (107201). The effects of oolong tea, specifically, are unclear.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for depression in older adults.\nA cohort study in older adults suggests that habitual oolong tea consumption is associated with 50% lower odds of having depressive symptoms when compared with those who never consume tea. This association followed a dose-repose pattern, with the greatest reduction in depressive symptoms found in those who consumed oolong tea with greater frequency, in larger amounts per occasion, in larger amounts per week, and for longer durations. However, social engagement such as drinking oolong tea in a teahouse or restaurant with other people may mediate the association of oolong tea consumption with depressive symptoms in older adults (112235). Since this study was conducted only in Chinese adults, it is unclear if the findings are generalizable to other populations.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of diabetes.\nOne small crossover study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming oolong tea 1500 mL daily for 30 days modestly lowers blood glucose when compared with water (12519). However, observational research in Japanese adults has found that consuming a cup or more of oolong tea daily is not associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with those who consume less than a cup daily (14313).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of dysmenorrhea.\nObservational research has found that drinking oolong tea is not associated with reduced odds of having dysmenorrhea when compared with not drinking oolong tea. However, only about 9% of the people included in this analysis drank oolong tea (102729).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral oolong tea for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oolong tea for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for the prevention of hypertension.\nObservational research in Chinese adults has found that consuming 120-599 mL of oolong tea or green tea daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of developing hypertension when compared with non-habitual tea drinkers. Drinking more than 600 mL daily is associated with a 65% reduced risk (12518). The effects of oolong tea, specifically, are unclear.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nA small clinical study in overweight and obese patients shows that consuming 300 mL or 2 grams of oolong tea (Fuigian Tea Import and Export Co., Ltd.), four times daily for 6 weeks, does not decrease body weight when compared with baseline. However, ingestion of oolong tea seems to decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with high baseline levels (94079).\nless\nOral cancer. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for preventing oral squamous cell carcinoma.\nA case-control study suggests that drinking oolong tea is associated with a 26-31% reduction in the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma, with the greatest benefit observed with the consumption of warm, moderately concentrated oolong tea in volumes over 500 mL daily. Additionally, subgroup analysis suggests that oolong tea is especially beneficial for reducing the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma in those with poor oral hygiene compared to those with good oral hygiene (112240).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for the prevention of osteoporosis.\nObservational research in individuals aged 30 years and older has found that habitual consumption of tea, including black tea, green tea, or oolong tea, for 10 years or more is associated with increased bone mineral density when compared with nonhabitual tea consumption (8116). The effects of oolong tea, specifically, are unclear.\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral oolong tea is beneficial for preventing ovarian cancer.\nObservational research has found that regular consumption of tea, including black tea, green tea, or oolong tea, is associated with a significantly lower risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared with those who never or seldom consume tea (9228, 13208). One of these studies found that consuming 2 or more cups of tea daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared with no regular tea consumption (13208). The effects of oolong tea, specifically, are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate oolong tea for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nOolong tea is most often consumed as a beverage in amounts of up to 900 mL daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nOolong tea can interfere with the absorption of iron in the diet of people who are iron-deficient. People who are iron-deficient should avoid drinking oolong tea (631, 8110, 9237).\n\nAdding milk to oolong tea might reduce some of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of drinking tea, potentially by binding with and reducing the absorption of flavonoids (220, 6032, 15219). More evidence is needed to determine the clinical significance of this potential interaction.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost clinical studies administer oolong tea as a beverage. Typically, oolong tea is standardized based on catechin or polyphenol content. In one clinical trial, the oolong tea was naturally rich in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) following oxidation of the leaves in a nitrogen-rich environment. The tea contained 279 mg GABA and 104.5 mg L-theanine per 100 grams (102762).",

Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nALCOHOL (Ethanol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine in oolong tea.\nOolong tea contains caffeine.

Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg per day inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2.

Caffeine is a methylxanthine that may inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation (11770, 11772). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products such as oolong tea, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770).

Infants given tea to drink seem to have an increased risk of microcytic anemia (631). However, a study of iron-deficient elderly patients suggests that concomitant use does not alter iron absorption in this population (185).

Some research suggests that caffeine, a constituent of oolong tea, may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine in oolong tea may also enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nUse with caution in patients with diarrhea.

Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to approximately 2-3 cups of tea per day, unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intake equivalent to approximately 4 cups of tea (11733, 98806).

In fatal overdose related to caffeine, the cause of death is usually ventricular fibrillation (11838, 11845).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with oolong tea.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nOolong tea contains caffeine. During the first trimester of pregnancy, caffeine is rapidly metabolized in as little as 3 hours, primarily to paraxanthine. Metabolism gradually slows and can take up to 10 hours by the third trimester. Caffeine is not metabolized by the fetus and can therefore accumulate in fetal tissue (109846).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of oolong tea are the leaf bud, leaf, and stem. Oolong tea is partially fermented and contains caffeine and polyphenols, including catechins (94079). Catechins include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epicatechin (EC), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG). Oolong tea contains 23.2% catechins, green tea contains 26.7%, and black tea contain 4.3% (12522).\n\nWhen tea is fermented, other polyphenols, such as the flavonoids theaflavins and thearubigins, are formed from catechins (12523, 15656). Oolong contains smaller amounts of these flavonoids than black tea because oolong tea is only partially fermented (12523). Oolong tea is more closely related to green tea than it is to black tea (12524). The caffeine content of oolong tea is variable, as with green and black teas. Oolong tea contains 50-60 mg caffeine per cup (12525).\nAnti-allergy effects\nOolong tea may have antiallergic properties. Catechins in oolong tea, particularly gallocatechin gallate (GCG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), seem to inhibit histamine release (12528).\nAnti-cancer effects\nBoth theaflavins and catechins have been shown to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells (15662).\nAntiviral effects\nCatechins and theaflavins in oolong tea have activity against HIV replication. Theaflavins have a greater anti-HIV effect than catechins (15658).\nCardiovascular effects\nOolong tea seems to have antioxidant properties (12522). It seems to suppress the oxidation low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Oxidized LDL may contribute to atherosclerosis (12525). In patients with coronary artery disease, oolong tea 1000 mL per day seems to lower hemoglobin A1C levels and to increase plasma adiponectin and low-density lipoprotein particle size, which may reduce the progression of atherosclerosis (12521). Catechins in oolong tea may inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, decrease the solubility of cholesterol in bile acid, and activate lipoprotein lipase (94079).\n\nThe caffeine in oolong tea stimulates the heart and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure. Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836). Caffeine can also acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but might not have this effect in habitual users (2722).\nCNS effects\nThe caffeine in oolong tea stimulates the central nervous system (CNS). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370).\n\nIt has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370). Caffeine also appears to increase plasma catecholamine levels (11837).\nCognitive effects\nThe caffeine content is also thought to be responsible for oolong tea's effects on cognitive performance (4221).\nDiuretic effects\nCaffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine (2712). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake (10206). Caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713). Caffeine does not substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCaffeine stimulates gastric acid secretion (11837).\nGlycemic effects\nThe polyphenols and catechins contained in oolong tea are believed to possess antidiabetic effects. However, in crossover study of otherwise healthy nondiabetic men, administration of four servings of either oolong tea, catechin-enriched oolong tea, or polyphenol enriched oolong tea daily for 5 days did not affect glucose or insulin concentrations after an oral glucose tolerance test, nor did it affect fasting plasma glucose or serum insulin after 5 days of treatment. Total daily caffeine intakes ranged from 180 to 208 mg, catechin content ranged from 220 to 490 mg, and polyphenol content ranged from 390 to 676 mg (94077).\nMetabolic effects\nClinical research in adult males shows that consumption of oolong tea twice daily for 14 days may increase fat oxidation when compared with placebo, but not when compared with caffeine. This study also shows that oolong tea does not change energy expenditure or heart rate when compared with consumption of placebo or caffeine. This may indicate that individuals acquire tolerance to the acute effects of oolong tea and its constituents, such as a caffeine, within 2 weeks (104785).\nMuscular effects\nThe caffeine in oolong tea stimulates the muscles. Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722).\nRespiratory effects\nCaffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using oolong tea for weight loss. It is believed the main components responsible for weight effects are caffeine and polyphenols. The caffeine in oolong tea increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and nonsympathetic mechanisms (13733). Preliminary clinical research suggests that oolong tea increases the metabolic rate and fat oxidation (12527). Other as yet unidentified constituents also seem to cause weight loss by inhibiting the activity of pancreatic lipase, which breaks down fat. Preliminary research suggests that oolong tea has an antiobesity effect in a high-fat diet (12526)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of oregano used medicinally are the leaves and other above-ground parts. An essential oil is extracted from the above-ground parts, although the amount varies from 0.03% to 4.6% between subspecies of Origanum vulgare and under different growing conditions (88189). The essential oil contains 70% to 85% volatile phenolic monoterpenes (2129, 88191). These include carvacrol (isopropyl-o-cresol), thymol (isopropyl-m-cresol), beta-fenchyl alcohol, delta-terpineol, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpinene (88188, 88192). Gamma-terpinene and rho-cymene are biosynthetic precursors of carvacrol and thymol (88189). Other compounds isolated from oregano leaves include rosmarinic acid, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, caffeoyl derivatives, acyclic compounds (linalool, linalyl acetate, beta-ocimene, myrcene), bicyclic sabinyl compounds (sabinene and its acetates), bornane-type compounds (camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate), and sesquiterpenes (beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D, germacrene D-4-ol, spathulenol, caryophylline oxide, oplopanone) (67217, 67236, 88189). The leaves also contain apigenin, chrysoeriol, diosmetin, quercetin and its glucosides, eriodictyol, cosmoside, vicenin-2, salvagenin, luteolin and its glucosides, thymoquinol glucopyranosides, jasmonic acids, lithospermic acids, flavanones, flavonols, and flavones (67223, 67233, 67303). Alcoholic extracts of the leaves contain tannins (21685).\nAntibacterial effects\nOregano essential oil and its constituent carvacrol have antibacterial activity against many organisms in vitro, including Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Flavobacterium suaveolens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica (316, 2130, 3703, 4065, 31330, 43372, 43402, 46890, 110121). The oil also has in vitro activity against both methicillin sensitive and methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (316, 31330, 67184, 67341, 110121). Oils from oregano strains rich in phenolic compounds such as carvacrol and thymol seem to have the greatest antibacterial activity (67330). These phenolic compounds accumulate in the lipid bilayer of the bacterial cell membrane, disrupting its structure and function (46890, 67330). Oregano essential oil caused leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in vitro, and also altered intracellular pH (67152). Carvacrol has been shown to interfere with the cell membrane of Bacillus cereus, increasing its permeability to hydrogen and potassium ions, and depleting intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (165). Bacillus cereus has also been reported to develop tolerance to non-lethal concentrations of carvacrol by altering the fatty acid composition of its cell membrane (67143).\n\nOregano has not been studied in human infections, but in a study of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, 43% were alive at 30 days when given oregano oil orally daily, whereas untreated animals all died within 1 week (67341).\n\nAlcoholic extracts of oregano leaves have activity in vitro against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, including some drug-resistant strains (88190). Aqueous extracts of the leaves have no antibacterial activity (88190).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn rat studies, oregano leaf extract is shown to lower blood glucose (67191, 110122) without altering plasma insulin levels (67191). In an in vitro study, an alcoholic oregano extract inhibited porcine pancreatic amylase, which would reduce breakdown of starch to glucose if replicated in vivo. However, amylase inhibition was variable between different strains of oregano plants, ranging from 9% to 57% (67204).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro tests indicate that oregano essential oil and its constituent carvacrol can inhibit growth of Aspergillus species, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (316, 31330, 43472, 46242, 46890, 59561, 67157). Oregano oil and carvacrol inhibit germination and mycelial growth of Candida albicans in vitro (67157).\n\nIn mice infected with Candida albicans, oregano oil or carvacrol given orally daily for 30 days was associated with an 80% survival rate, whereas untreated animals died within 10 days (67157).\nAntiviral effects\nOregano essential oil and its constituent carvacrol have activity in vitro against influenza virus H1N1, although the concentration required may be toxic to human cells (17745).\nFertility effects\nA study in rats with induced polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) shows that administering oral oregano leaf extract 250 or 500 mg/kg daily for 30 days indirectly enhances fertility by improving markers associated with ovarian follicular development and hormonal abnormalities in PCOS (111717)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nBerberine, a constituent of Oregon grape, undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism. It also appears to be a substrate of nuclear transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter. Theoretically, this might limit its oral bioavailability (13525).\nExcretion\nBerberine, a constituent of Oregon grape, is excreted in the urine and feces (2591, 34314).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Oregon grape are the rhizome, bark, and root. Oregon grape contains the alkaloids berberine, jatrorrhizine, and magnoflorine (14001, 14002, 14003, 14333, 33656).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTopical application of Oregon grape reduces skin inflammation associated with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as keratinocyte hyperproliferation (854, 857, 14000, 14333, 67370). Preliminary research suggests that the constituent berberine blocks production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. Preliminary research also suggests that berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe blood-glucose lowering effect of berberine, a constituent of Oregon grape, has been attributed to its ability to increase insulin receptor expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes (34265). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that berberine increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity (34240, 34242, 34243). Activation of AMPK can stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscles, increase the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and reduce the production of glucose in the liver (91948). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion (34254). Some animal research also shows that berberine can increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-delta expression, although berberine also appears to reduce PPAR-gamma expression in the liver of diabetic rats (34249).\nAntimicrobial effects\nOregon grape extracts appear to have antibacterial and antifungal activity (1400214003, 67363, 67371). The Oregon grape constituent jatrorrhizine appears to have good activity against a variety of dermatophytes and Candida species (14003). The constituent berberine has antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Berberine has demonstrated activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia (2530, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012, 67363, 67371). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540).\nCardiovascular effects\nBerberine, a constituent of Oregon grape, has antihypertensive, inotropic, and antiarrhythmic properties. Berberine appears to have alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. Preliminary research suggests that berberine might also lower blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Berberine might also inhibit aldose reductase (13520).\nGastrointestinal effects\nOregon grape is used for various gastrointestinal problems, such as peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and stomach upset. The constituent berberine appears to reduce the secretion of gastric acid and slow down intestinal transit, reducing diarrhea (262, 13537, 67374).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that berberine, an Oregon grape constituent, might protect the liver from hepatotoxins (13519). Also, berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL) 1-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (13522)."

Constituents of oriental arborvitae include alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, saponin, tannins, and terpenes (100609). The monoterpene thujone is found in the volatile oil of oriental arborvitae (12).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that an aqueous leaf extract of oriental arborvitae inhibits TNF-alpha-induced inflammation in vascular endothelial cells, possibly by suppressing the activation of NF-kB and inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (100613).\nAntibacterial effects\nOriental arborvitae seems to have some antibacterial activity (4041, 100609). In vitro research shows that an ethanolic leaf extract of oriental arborvitae can inhibit the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The phenolic constituent quercetin is thought to play a role in oriental arborvitae's antibacterial effects. This same study shows that use of oriental arborvitae with an ethanolic extract of cannabis or guava leaf leads to greater inhibition of MRSA growth, possibly due to the combined effects of catechin and phenolics such as quercetin and gallic acid in the extracts (100609).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that an ethanolic leaf extract of oriental arborvitae has anticancer effects. This extract has cytotoxic effects against human lung cancer cells, in vitro, and seems to inhibit angiogenesis, as demonstrated in zebrafish. The mechanisms of action for these effects are unclear; however, the anti-angiogenesis effects may be due to the thujone constituent, which appears to decrease expression of the angiogenic proteins VEGF and ANG4 in animal and in vitro research (100612).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that oriental arborvitae leaf extracts have dose-dependent antioxidant effects, evidenced in part through inhibition of hydrogen peroxide-induced hemolysis of red blood cells. Ethanolic and methanolic extracts appear to have greater antioxidant effects compared with ethyl-acetate and water extracts. The phenol and flavonoid constituents in oriental arborvitae are thought to play a role. The antioxidant effects of oriental arborvitae extracts are small when compared with vitamin C (100610).\nHair growth effects\nAnimal research shows that topical application of a water extract of oriental arborvitae leaf promotes hair growth to a greater degree than minoxidil (Rogaine) 1% solution in a mouse model of hair loss. This extract appears to induce and prolong the growth (anagen) phase of the hair growth cycle, as evidenced by increased levels of beta-catenin and Shh proteins in hair follicles. These proteins play a role in transitioning hair follicles from the resting (telogen) phase to the growth (anagen) phase (100611). It is unknown whether oriental arborvitae has superior hair growth effects to the commercially available minoxidil (Rogaine) 2% and 5% formulations."

In vitro, Tagetes minuta inhibits the production of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (109313). The anti-inflammatory effects of Tagetes minuta may play a role in the mechanism of action of some of its traditional uses, including gastrointestinal conditions. In vitro, Tagetes minuta extracts had anti-inflammatory effects in stomach and intestinal cells (109313).\nAntimicrobial effects\nOrnamental marigold has been traditionally used as an antimicrobial, and there is interest in this plant as a future antimicrobial agent. In vitro, Tagetes minuta extract and essential oil have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and also against fungi (95437).\nDiuretic effects\nTraditionally, ornamental marigold has been used for diuretic effects. The diuretic effects of ornamental marigold are of interest for both genitourinary issues and hypertension (11, 95437, 109312). In an animal hypertensive model, Tagetes erecta has diuretic effects, with an increased excretion of urine and sodium, but not potassium, chloride, or calcium (109312).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPreliminary research suggests that Tagetes lucida extract has antispasmodic activity in vitro. This activity may be mediated by inhibiting histaminergic and serotonergic receptors, and/or blocking calcium channels. Possible bioactive compounds were the coumarins umbelliferone and herniarin (109311). In an animal model, an extract of Tagetes erecta had ulcer healing effects. The mechanism of action seems to be related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, possibly playing a role in the increased production of mucin (109314).\nInsecticidal\nAlpha-terthienyl, a constituent of ornamental marigold, exhibits nematocidal and larvicidal activity (11). Additionally, the constituent ocimenone demonstrates insecticidal activity against mosquito larvae (11).\nRespiratory effects\nIn China, ornamental marigold is traditionally used for whooping cough and to treat regular coughs and colds.

Also, small clinical studies show that taking a single dose of ornithine hydrochloride 0.1 gram/kg seems to increase peak cycling speed in active young males, without changing exercise duration, maximal oxygen consumption, or maximal heart rate (67400, 67404). A small clinical study in young male weightlifters shows that taking a combination of ornithine 1 gram and arginine 1 gram daily for 30-35 days is associated with increased lean body mass, strength, and peak anaerobic power when compared with placebo (32207, 67427).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDry skin.

Study results indicate that a ghrelin antagonist blocks ornithine-induced stimulation of plasma growth hormone, while somatostatin and growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists have no effect. From this, researchers theorize that growth hormone stimulation by ornithine is mediated by ghrelin receptor signaling pathways (110716).\nMood effects\nSome evidence in humans suggests that benefits of ornithine on mood are possibly related to decreases in the ratio of cortisol to the hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (95226).\nMuscle mass effects\nOrnithine is of interest as a supplement to improve athletic performance. One possible mechanism of action is its ability to increase muscle mass. Ornithine serves as a precursor to arginine, which is used in protein synthesis (95227). Also, ornithine might increase the production of growth hormone (95227) although not all research agrees (2418). Also, although ornithine does not increase insulin release (2417), it does increase the production of insulin like growth facor-1 (IGF-1) (95227). This suggests that ornithine might improve muscle mass through a hormone-related mechanism.\nSleep effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy patients shows that ornithine may improve some measures of sleep quality and may help regulate the circadian clock. Taking ornithine hydrochloride 500 mg, containing 400 mg of ornithine, daily for 28 days improved feelings of sleepiness on rising by a small amount in Japanese members of an Antarctic expedition experiencing sleep deterioration (95225). Taking this same dose for 8 weeks improved sleep length in healthy adult workers (95226). Additionally, taking ornithine 400 mg daily for 7 days delayed the onset of melatonin release after exposure to dim light in healthy patients, suggesting that it might regulate the circadian clock (102065). Animal research also suggests that ornithine can improve sleep latency, total sleep time, and mean sleep duration (110715). The mechanism of these effects is unknown, and whether ornithine will improve sleep measures in patients with diagnosed sleep disorders is unclear.\nWound-healing effects\nOrnithine is a precursor in the synthesis of polyamine and proline, which are needed for collagen synthesis and wound repair. Research suggests that ornithine levels in the blood decrease following major surgery, possibly because of the need for polyamine and proline for wound healing (67390, 95224)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOrnithine ketoglutarate is a synthetic combination of two molecules of ornithine and alpha-ketoglutaric acid, a precursor of the amino acid glutamine (67450).\nAnabolic activity\nSeveral human and animal studies have reported that enteral administration of ornithine ketoglutarate improves nitrogen balance and influences hormone levels, promoting an overall anabolic or anti-catabolic state with increased protein turnover (2443, 2444, 67445, 67446, 67447, 67461). In healthy people, ornithine ketoglutarate modifies amino acid metabolism and increases blood insulin and glucagon levels (2415). Ornithine ketoglutarate also stimulates polyamines, molecules with more than one amino group, some of which are involved in cell growth (67455).The anabolic effects of ornithine ketoglutarate likely contribute to its benefits on growth, muscle development, and skin healing."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOscillococcinum is a homeopathic dilution of duck liver and heart extract. Homeopathy is a system of medicine established in the 19th century by a German physician named Samuel Hahnemann. Its basic principles are that \"like treats like\" and \"potentiation through dilution.\" Normally, in homeopathy, influenza would be treated with an extreme dilution of a substance that normally causes influenza when taken in high doses. In the case of oscillococcinum, the homeopathy principle is 'isopathy', a principle suggesting that a medicine derived from an agent that causes the disease is used to cure the disease. The heart and liver of ducks are thought to be reservoirs of the influenza virus (92287).\n\nPractitioners of homeopathy believe that more diluted preparations are more potent. Many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that they contain little or no active ingredient. Therefore, most homeopathic products are not expected to have any pharmacological effects, drug interactions, or other harmful effects. Any beneficial effects are controversial and cannot be explained by current scientific methods. Dilutions of 1 to 10 are designated by an \"X.\" So, a 1X dilution = 1:10; 3X = 1:1000; 6X = 1:1,000,000. Dilutions of 1 to 100 are designated by a \"C.\" A 1C dilution = 1:100; 3C = 1:1,000,000. Dilutions of 24X or 12C or more contain zero molecules of the original active ingredient. Oscillococcinum is usually diluted from 9C to 200C and therefore usually contains no measurable active ingredient (12011).\n\nLaboratory research investigating the mechanism of action of oscillococcinum is not available."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOstarine is readily absorbed when taken orally, with a peak plasma concentration of around 56 ng/mL occurring at approximately 1 hour (98834).\nMetabolism\nOstarine undergoes glucuronidation, primarily by UGT2B7, to an inactive metabolite. It also undergoes oxidation via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (98834).\nExcretion\nOstarine has a half-life of around 21-24 hours. It is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion as a glucuronidated metabolite (98834). However, some amount of ostarine is also excreted renally, as ostarine can be detected in the urine (111382, 111383).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOstarine is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) with a structure derived from the antiandrogen medication bicalutamide. It is in the arylpropionamide class (98838).\nAndrogenic effects\nOstarine may selectively bind to androgen receptors, but it is unclear whether it reacts with other nuclear hormone receptors. In vitro research suggests that ostarine selectively binds androgen receptors and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, leading to increased muscle cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vivo research shows that ostarine modulates and enhances muscle cell differentiation by increasing myogenin expression (98835, 98838, 111386).\n\nSome research in male animals shows that ostarine improves muscle mass and bone density without causing negative effects on other androgen-sensitive tissues, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles (98833, 106196). However, other animal research shows that ostarine does increase prostate weight, suggesting that it may have some non-beneficial androgenic effects. The effects of ostarine on the prostate weight appear to be modulated by the addition of raloxifene. Researchers theorize that the anabolic benefits of ostarine for muscle structure and metabolism are maintained, while raloxifene reduces the androgenic potential for increasing prostate weight (106196, 111384, 111387).\n\nAnimal research also suggests that the timing of ostarine administration may influence its effects. When given immediately after orchiectomy as osteoporosis prophylaxis, ostarine exhibits anabolic effects such as increased muscle weight, enhanced expression of myostatin, upregulated insulin growth factor-1, and increased prostate weight. However, initiating ostarine at 12 weeks after orchiectomy offers less benefit to muscle parameters but also limits increases in prostate weight (111387).\n\nIn animal postmenopausal ovariectomized models, ostarine increased muscle capillary density and muscle weight (106194, 106195). Researchers believe these properties allow for beneficial effects on skeletal muscle without the safety concerns of steroidal androgens and are evaluating the use of ostarine for improving muscle strength and lean body mass in patients with wasting conditions such as sarcopenia and cancer-related cachexia.\n\nAdditionally, researchers are modifying the structure of ostarine to identify analogs with potent antiandrogenic effects on prostate tissue, which could be useful for treating prostate cancer (98838). In adipocytes in vitro, ostarine binds to the androgen receptor and stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis. In addition, the release of leptin and adiponectin is reduced (106193).\nBone effects\nIn an animal postmenopausal ovariectomized model, ostarine enhanced bone healing (106195). However, the effects of ostarine on bone in an orchiectomized animal model of osteoporosis are unclear. When given immediately after orchiectomy as osteoporosis prophylaxis, ostarine exhibits improved bone parameters. However, initiating ostarine at 12 weeks after orchiectomy has a negative effect on bone healing (106196, 111387)."
