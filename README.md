## 📖 Overview

RxSupplementsAI is a RAG-based question-answering system designed to provide accurate, evidence-based information about dietary supplements, herbal medicines, and natural products. The system combines semantic search with large language models to deliver contextually relevant answers while citing authoritative sources.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Hybrid Retrieval System** - Vector similarity search (FAISS) with BM25 fallback
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Responses** - Mistral model via Ollama for natural language generation
- 📚 **Large Knowledge Base** - 30,566+ documents 
- 💬 **Interactive Chat Interface** - Modern React-based web application
- 📊 **Source Citations** - All answers include citations to original sources

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed with Mistral model

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CSE573_Class_Project_RxSupplementsAI.git
cd CSE573_Class_Project_RxSupplementsAI
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors sentence-transformers faiss-cpu rank-bm25 requests numpy

# Ensure Ollama is running with Mistral
ollama pull mistral
ollama serve
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd WebApp/my-react-app
npm install
```

### 4. Build Corpus (if starting fresh)

```bash
cd Scripts

# Generate FAISS vector index
python natmedcorpus.py

# Generate BM25 index
python BM25_corpus.py
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Application

**1. Start Ollama (if not running):**
```bash
ollama serve
```

**2. Start the Backend API:**
```bash
cd Scripts
python query_phi.py
# Server runs on http://localhost:8181
```

**3. Start the Frontend:**
```bash
cd WebApp/my-react-app
npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:5173
```

**4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`**

### Example Queries

- *"What are the benefits of taking L-Theanine?"*
- *"Is it safe to take vitamin D during pregnancy?"*
- *"What supplements can help with anxiety?"*
- *"How does turmeric interact with blood thinners?"*

## 📊 Data Sources

| Source | Description | Documents |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Natural Medicines NatMedPro Database** | Professional monographs on supplements, herbs, and natural products |
| **Reddit r/supplements** | Community discussions and experiences |
| **Total Corpus** | Combined indexed documents | **30,566** |

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

The system was evaluated using 50 curated test questions covering:
- Supplement benefits and uses
- Safety and side effects
- Drug interactions
- Dosage recommendations
- Special populations (pregnancy, children)
- Off-topic queries (to test refusal to answer)

### Retrieval Comparison

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **FAISS (Vector)** | Semantic understanding, handles paraphrasing | May retrieve tangentially related content |
| **BM25 (Keyword)** | Exact term matching | Struggles with synonyms and context |
