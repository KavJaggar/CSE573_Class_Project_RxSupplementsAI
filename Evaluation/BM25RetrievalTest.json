Since light inhibits melatonin secretion and darkness stimulates its secretion (1773, 62205, 62887, 62928, 63015), people who suffer from an insufficient amount of environmental light often have decreased endogenous melatonin secretion (8247). Infants with low melatonin production are more likely to experience a life-threatening event (ALTE) (8262). Insomniacs of all ages can also have decreased melatonin levels. Patients with sleep disorders related to other conditions, such as fibromyalgia and depression, can also have low levels (6498). Recent information also shows that music therapy can improve endogenous serum melatonin levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease, possibly a contributing factor to patients' relaxed and calm mood (8241).
