In insects, ecdysteroids regulate metamorphosis, molting, and other life-cycle processes (100230). Although some plants contain phytoecdysteroids, humans typically do not eat these plants. Therefore, knowledge about the dietary intake of ecdysteroids is limited (100233).",

Some dietary supplements containing ecdysterone indicate the source as spinach or suma root (106310).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Excretion\nEcdysterone appears in the urine after oral administration (9903, 106312). It remains in the urine for approximately 68 hours (9903) with maximum levels occurring 2.8-8.5 hours after intake and the maximum excretion rate occurring 0.4-4.4 hours after intake (106312). Reported metabolites of ecdysterone also excreted in urine include 2-deoxyecdysterone, 14-deoxyecdysterone, deoxyecdysone, and 14-deoxypoststerone (9903, 106312). Some metabolites remain detectable for 3-4 days after intake (106312).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEcdysteroids are a class of steroids with a polyhydroxylated cyclopentano-alpha-erhydrophenanthrene ring system (100230). Ecdysterone is an ecdysteroid found in insects, some aquatic animals, and some plants (9903, 10389). Plants used to isolate ecdysterone have included spinach, quinoa, Achyranthes bidentata, Achyranthes japonica, Cyanotis arachnoidea, Diploclisia glaucescens, Hebanthe eriantha, Serratula strangulate, and Silene guntensis (100231, 100236, 100237, 106313, 106314).\nAntibacterial effects\nThere is interest in using 20-hydroxyecdysone, an ecdysteroid, for its antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In vitro research shows that 20-hydroxyecdysone from roots of Achyranthes japonica Nakai has poor antibacterial activity against MRSA when used alone. However 20-hydroxyecdysone seems to augment the antibacterial activity of ampicillin and gentamicin in vitro (100236).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using ecdysteroids to help eradicate cancer and also to sensitize cancer cells to anticancer drugs (100237, 100238, 100239). In vitro research shows that phytoecdysteroids isolated from aerial parts of Silene guntensis inhibited the cell growth of human cervix adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (100237). Additional in vitro research shows that the diacetonide and acetonide derivatives of 20-hydroxyecdysone, an ecdysteroid, sensitize cancer cell lines to the anticancer drugs doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and vincristine, but not cisplatin (100238).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using ecdysteroids for diabetes. In vitro research shows that ecdysterone lowers glucose in hepatocytes independently of insulin secretion and does not stimulate insulin secretion. This was similar to the effect of the drug metformin in vitro (100232).\nAntioxidant effects\nSeveral animal and in vitro studies show that ecdysteroids have antioxidant effects (100231, 106314, 110705, 110706). One vitro study shows that 20-hydroxyecdysone, an ecdysteroid, and its three analogs extracted from Serratula strangulata have antioxidant effects and protect against lipid peroxidation of rat liver microsomes and hemolysis of human erythrocytes (100231). In addition, animal research shows that ecdysterone attenuates radiation-induced increases in superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde levels in the tongue (106314). Another animal study suggests that ecdysteroids prevent hippocampal oxidative stress by increasing levels of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase. Researchers theorize that increasing antioxidant enzymes may prevent apoptosis and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (110705, 110706). Also in a rat model of Alzheimer disease, researchers found that ecdysteroids appear to modulate decreases in total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde, an indicator of oxidative stress (110705).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal research suggests that oral ecdysteroids may modulate anxiety-like behavior in rats with amyloid-beta-induced Alzheimer disease when compared with untreated amyloid-beta-induced disease (110705).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using beta-ecdysterone, an ecdysteroid, for preventing intervertebral disc degeneration by reducing cell apoptosis. In vitro research shows that beta-ecdysterone reduces apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells possibly by reducing autophagy (100243).\nCognitive effects\nAnimal research suggests that ecdysteroids may improve several measures of cognitive function. In a rat model of Alzheimer disease, oral ecdysteroids improved spatial activity, spatial memory, passive avoidance learning, memory impairment, recognition memory, memory acquisition, cognitive flexibility, hippocampal neuronal loss, and hippocampal activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase when compared with an untreated control group with induced Alzheimer disease. These effects were all amplified by the addition of high intensity interval training (HIIT) to ecdysteroid treatment. Additionally, the combination of ecdysteroids and HIIT may ameliorate neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Researchers theorize that the combination of ecdysteroids and HIIT may exert their effects by enhancing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, or preventing the excessive production of reactive oxygen species. These effects may prevent apoptosis and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (110705, 110706).\nHormonal effects\nEcdysterone, an ecdysteroid, is chemically similar to testosterone, which has led to the belief that it might possess anabolic properties. Animal research suggests that ecdysterone affects steroid receptors. It is unclear whether this effect is mediated by receptor or feedback loop regulation rather than bioconversion into steroids. Possible mechanisms include increased protein synthesis, anticatabolic effects from blocking cortisol receptors and stimulation of anabolic or androgenic steroid receptors (9904, 9905, 10390, 100233, 100234). Additionally, there is interest in using ecdysteroids for muscle injuries, sarcopenia, and cachexia. Animal research shows that ecdysterone increases the size of muscle fibers and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and reduces estrogen levels (100241). Animal research also shows that another ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone, extracted from Antherea pernyi Pas, increases the weight of prostate-semina and muscles of castrated mice. It also promotes the growth of younger male mice (100230). However, there is still no research in humans demonstrating any of these effects.\nHypolipidemic effects\nAlthough ecdysteroids are of interest for reducing plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels, most animal research suggests that ecdysteroids are not beneficial or this purpose. Ecdysterone, an ecdysteroid, does not improve levels of liver or plasma cholesterol or triglycerides in an obese rat model (106313).\nMuscular effects\nIn some animal and in vitro models, ecdysteroids have been shown to increase protein synthesis and muscle mass (100234, 106311). However, ecdysteroids do not seem to have anabolic effects on the skeletal muscle in an animal sarcopenia model (106311).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using ecdysteroids to prevent loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and protect against the worsening of Parkinson disease. In vitro research shows that beta-ecdysterone, an ecdysteroid, protects cell lines against apoptosis caused by the Parkinson disease-related neurotoxin, 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) (100240).\nRenal effects\nRenal fibrosis can be caused by inflammation, obstruction by kidney stones, or metabolic issues such as diabetic nephropathy. It often leads to loss of renal function and end stage of diabetes kidney disease. There is interest in the phytoecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysterone, for reducing renal injury in diabetes. In vitro research shows that 20-hydroxyecdysone might reduce fibrosis in renal proximal tubule cells by suppressing post-receptor signals of transforming growth factor-beta1 and restoring tubule epithelial function (100235)."

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom recommends against the use of oral echinacea products in children under 12 years of age due to this risk of allergic reaction (18207).\n\nEchinacea species are members of the Asteraceae family. People who are sensitive to other members of the Asteraceae family (ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies) may be at higher risk for allergic reactions to echinacea.\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Some experts have warned that echinacea might interfere with the body's immune and inflammatory response against COVID-19.

Clinical studies in otherwise healthy children 1-12 years old taking various forms of echinacea nasally or orally for upper respiratory tract infection shows no difference in the incidence of adverse effects between echinacea and placebo, with most reactions being mild (117141).Some clinical research shows that an extract of the above-ground parts of Echinacea purpurea (EC31J2, Echinacin Saft, Madaus AG) in a dose of 3.75 mL twice daily (for ages 2 years to 5 years) or 7.5 mL twice daily (for ages 6 years to 11 years) is safe when used for up to 10 days (4989). However, about 7% of children experienced a rash after taking echinacea, which might have been caused by an allergic reaction (4989). In contrast, another clinical study in children 4-12 years old shows that a specific Echinacea purpurea product (Echinaforce Junior, A. Vogel) does not cause allergic or urticarial reactions more frequently than vitamin C (105719). However, there is concern that allergic reactions could be severe in some children. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom recommends against the use of oral echinacea products in children under 12 years of age due to this risk of allergic reaction (18207).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, short-term.

An unpleasant taste, dry mouth, and burning, tingling or numbness of the tongue also occur (11970, 12355, 17519, 20059, 20070, 20077).\nless\nHematologic\nA 51-year-old female presented with leukopenia after taking echinacea 450 mg three times daily for 2 months, along with ginkgo biloba, multivitamins, and calcium. Her leukocyte count recovered upon stopping these supplements, but dropped again when she restarted echinacea alone about a year later. The problem resolved when echinacea was stopped permanently (48533). A 32-year-old male presented with severe thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) about 2 weeks after using an extract of E. pallida to treat a cold. He required admission to an intensive care unit and extensive plasmapheresis. The authors speculate that immunostimulant effects of echinacea induced or exacerbated the TTP (48572).\nless\nHepatic\nAlthough uncommon, cases of echinacea-induced hepatitis have been reported. One case report describes acute cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis in a 45-year-old male who had been taking an echinacea root extract 1500 mg daily for about 2 weeks. He presented with significantly elevated liver function tests (LFTs), elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and a positive test for anti-smooth muscle antibodies, indicating an autoimmune process. Elevated LFTs and IgG levels returned to normal within one month of stopping echinacea (17518). Another case report describes acute cholestatic hepatitis in a 44-year-old male who had taken echinacea root tablets 600 mg daily for 5 days to treat flu-like symptoms. He presented with elevated LFTs, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio (INR). His condition gradually improved after stopping echinacea, and his LFTs normalized within 3 months (91528).\n\nSeven cases of hepatitis associated with echinacea use were reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee between 1979 and 2000, but specific details are lacking (8225).\n\nOne case report describes acute liver failure in a 2 year-old child who had been given about 100 mg of echinacea daily for 2 weeks. The patient presented with jaundice, diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and significantly elevated LFTs. A liver biopsy showed hepatocyte swelling, spotty necrosis, and inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils. A full recovery was made over a 2-week period (88166).\nless\nImmunologic\nAllergic reactions, including urticaria, runny nose, dyspnea, bronchospasm, acute asthma, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, have been reported with various echinacea preparations (638, 1358, 8225). Atopic individuals and those sensitive to other members of the Asteraceae family (ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies) seem to be at higher risk for these reactions (1358, 8225).\n\nA case report describes a 36-year-old female who presented with muscle weakness, electrolyte abnormalities, renal tubular acidosis, fatigue, and dry mouth and eyes after taking echinacea, kava, and St. John's Wort for 2 weeks., She also had a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, with elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies SSA and SSB. Sjogren syndrome was diagnosed; the authors hypothesize that it may have been triggered by the immunostimulant effects of echinacea (10319). A 55-year-old male with a history of pemphigus vulgaris in remission for about a year experienced a flare of the disease after taking an echinacea supplement for one week. After stopping echinacea, medical treatment resulted in partial control of the disease (12171). Another case report describes a 58-year-old male who presented with marked eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels while taking an echinacea supplement. He required prednisone therapy until he stopped taking echinacea 3 years later, at which time his eosinophils and IgE normalized (48623). A 41-year-old male experienced four episodes of erythema nodosum, each occurring after he had taken echinacea for early symptoms of influenza. After stopping echinacea, he had no further exacerbations of erythema nodosum, suggesting that it had been triggered by the immunostimulant effects of echinacea (7057).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nReports of arthralgia and myalgia have been associated with echinacea (13418).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nHeadache has been reported in people taking various echinacea preparations orally (3282, 11970, 17519, 20059, 20064).

Taking echinacea orally while still healthy may help prevent the common cold, but the benefit is probably modest. Echinacea does not seem to have a significant benefit for treating colds that have already developed.\nThree meta-analyses show a 10% to 58% reduction in the risk of developing a cold when taking various forms of echinacea (17520, 17522, 95652). A large clinical study shows that adults who use a specific echinacea extract (Echinaforce, A. Vogel Bioforce AG) 0.9 mL three times daily (2400 mg echinacea daily) for 4 months, with an increase to 0.9 mL five times daily (4000 mg echinacea daily) at the first sign of a cold, have 59% fewer cold episodes and 26% fewer days with cold symptoms than those taking placebo (18225). Many smaller studies have shown a non-significant trend toward a prophylactic benefit, but they were likely underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference (3282, 6386, 17521, 95652). Research in adults who are deliberately infected with cold viruses shows that taking echinacea products either does not reduce the incidence of colds, or has a limited effect which is not statistically significant. Products used include E. angustifolia root extract 300 mg three times daily for 7 days before and 5 days after experimental infection (13419), an alcoholic extract of E. purpurea above-ground parts (EchinaGuard, Madaus AG) 2.5 mL three times daily for 7 days before and 7 days after experimental infection (12354), or echinacea 300 mg three times daily for 14 days before and 5 days after experimental infection (8228). These studies are small and have methodological problems.\n\nSome small clinical studies have suggested that taking E. purpurea extracts as a tincture or tea to treat the common cold modestly reduces symptom severity and reduces cold duration by a couple of days (6384, 10320, 10802, 12355, 14419, 20062, 111530). Specific products used in these studies include Echinilin by Inovobiologic Inc., and Echinacin and EchinaGuard by Madaus AG (10320, 10802, 12355, 20062). In contrast, higher quality clinical research shows that taking E. purpurea alone or with E. angustifolia does not reduce duration or severity of cold symptoms when compared with placebo (10800, 11970, 17519, 20059).\n\nEchinacea has also been evaluated in children. Preliminary clinical research in healthy children 4-12 years old shows that taking a specific E. purpurea product (Echinaforce Junior, A. Vogel) 400 mg three times daily for 4 months reduces the occurrence of cold symptoms, respiratory complications (such as pneumonia and otitis media), and antibiotic prescriptions by 30%, 52%, and 62%, respectively, when compared with vitamin C 50 mg three times daily. Taking echinacea also reduces the average duration of symptoms during respiratory illness by an average of 1.4 days when compared with vitamin C (105719). However, other clinical research in children has found no benefit with a specific E. purpurea product (Echinacin, Madaus AG) (4989, 95653).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral echinacea reduces anxiety.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific E. angustifolia extract (ExtractumPharma ZRT) 40 mg once or twice daily for 7 days reduces anxiety scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale when compared with placebo (20064, 103233). This extract seems to be more effective in patients with high baseline anxiety scores (103233). A lower dose of 20 mg daily appears to be ineffective (20064). Conversely, a small clinical study in physically healthy adults with mild to moderate anxiety shows that taking the same E. angustifolia extract at doses of 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks does not reduce anxiety when compared with placebo (106626).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral echinacea improves athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, recreationally active males shows that taking echinacea (Puritan's Pride) 2 grams four times daily for 28 days increases serum erythropoietin levels and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) during exercise tests (20066). However, two small clinical studies in endurance trained athletes and in non-athletes with high aerobic fitness show that taking E. purpurea 8 or 16 grams once daily for 35 days in combination with other ingredients (Biomedical Research Lab), or taking E. purpurea (Puritan's Pride) 8 grams daily for 42 days, has no effect on erythropoietin levels, VO2max, or aerobic capacity (95651, 101593). A meta-analysis of these and other small clinical trials in trained and recreational athletes shows that taking echinacea 8 grams orally daily for 28-42 days does not improve VO2max, hemoglobin, or erythropoietin levels when compared with placebo (114569). However, this analysis may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Some evidence shows that an echinacea cream may be effective in mild disease, but it has not been compared to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild atopic dermatitis shows that applying a cream containing echinacea (Linola Plus Cream, Dr. August Wolff GmbH & Co) 2-3 times daily for 12 weeks reduces symptoms such as erythema, edema, pruritus, and dryness when compared with a cream containing birch bark extract (Imlan Crème Pur, Birken AG). However, the echinacea product was no different to the comparator cream at the 4- and 8-week assessments, indicating that it might take up to 12 weeks to show benefit (97499).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nBurns. Although there has been interest in using topical echinacea for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for preventing or treating COVID-19.\nA moderate-size open-label clinical study tested the effects of echinacea to prevent or treat respiratory viruses. This study of otherwise healthy adults in Bulgaria shows that taking echinacea extract (Echinaforce, A. Vogel AG) 2400 mg daily for cycles of 2, 2, and 1 months, with a 1-week break between each cycle, does not reduce symptomatic respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV-2, or respiratory virus detection overall when compared with usual care. However, echinacea extract does reduce the risk of a positive test for coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 by 48% and 63%, respectively. In patients who develop a symptomatic respiratory tract infection, this study also shows that taking the same echinacea extract 4000 mg daily for up to 10 days speeds viral clearance compared with usual care when all virus types were analyzed; however, clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was not improved. Echinacea may also reduce the number of days with a fever, but not other symptoms (111174). The validity of this study is limited by lack of blinding. Further, most patients were unvaccinated against COVID-19; it is unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to vaccinated patients. Another small single-blinded clinical study conducted in Iran in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking echinacea extract syrup (250 mg extract per 5 mL) 5 mL three times daily for 5 days in addition to standard care does not significantly improve cough, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, or temperature compared with standard care alone (116241). The validity of this study is limited by its small sample size and short duration.\n\nEchinacea has also been studied for long COVID. A moderate-size clinical trial in adults with recent COVID -19 infection shows that taking a combination product containing echinacea 30 mg, rose hips, zinc, and other ingredients orally daily for 2 months moderately improves fatigue scores when compared with placebo (114570).\nless\nGenital herpes. It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for genital herpes in patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2.\nSome clinical research shows that a specific E. purpurea extract (Echinaforce, A. Vogel Bioforce AG) 800 mg orally twice daily for 6 months does not seem to prevent or reduce the frequency or duration of recurrent genital herpes in patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2 (7087).\nless\nGingivitis. Echinacea, in a mouth rinse or periodontal patch, has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a mouth rinse containing echinacea, gotu kola, and elderberry (HM-302, Izun Pharmaceuticals) 15 mL three times daily for 14 days might prevent worsening of gingivitis when compared with a placebo rinse, but it produces only minimal improvement in symptoms (20069). Applying a periodontal patch containing echinacea, gotu kola, and elderberry (PerioPatch, Izun Pharmaceuticals) either as a single dose, or three times daily for 1 day then once daily for 2 days seems to reduce some measures of inflammation and gingivitis at some time points, but effects lack consistency (20068, 20070).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Although there has been interest in using topical echinacea for herpes labialis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). Oral echinacea has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its benefit when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product containing echinacea, andrographis, grapefruit, papaya, pau d'arco, and cat's claw (Immune Act, Erba Vita SpA) three tablets daily for one month reduces the recurrence of anal condylomata in patients following surgical removal. After one month, the recurrence rate was about 4% in the echinacea group compared with 18% in the control group; after 6 months the recurrence rates were about 7% and 27%, respectively (20073). However, poor study methodology limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nInfluenza. Limited data suggest that oral echinacea may improve the response to influenza vaccine, and that a combination product containing echinacea may improve rates of recovery from influenza.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a taking a specific echinacea product (Monoselect Echinacea, PharmExtracta) 200 mg orally daily for 15 days, then 100 mg daily for 15 days, followed by 100 mg every other day for 60 days, might improve the response to influenza vaccine in people with chronic bronchitis or asthma (18226). Higher quality research is needed to confirm these results. Taking a specific combination product (Echinaforce Hot Drink, A. Vogel Bioforce AG), containing elderberry juice and extracts of E. purpurea above-ground parts and roots, 5 mL five times daily for 3 days, then three times daily for 7 days, improves rates of recovery and influenza-related respiratory complications similarly to oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (95650). However, due to the lack of a placebo group, it is unclear if both treatments were beneficial or if the outcomes represent the natural progression of influenza.\nless\nInsect bite. It is unclear if topical homeopathy with a gel containing echinacea is beneficial for insect bite treatment. Oral echinacea has not been evaluated for this use.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a homeopathic after-bite gel, containing echinacea, marsh Labrador tea, and stinging nettle, on affected areas does not reduce erythema or itching after a mosquito bite when compared with placebo (89235).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for patients with this condition.\nA small clinical study in adults with erosive oral lichen planus in Iran shows that taking a specific echinacea extract tablet (Immustim, Goldaru Corp.) 114 mg three times daily for 35 days decreases pain scores, number of lesions, and symptom severity when compared with placebo. However, all patients also used a mouthwash containing betamethasone, diphenhydramine, nystatin, and aluminum-magnesium suspension three times daily (111173).\nless\nMalaria. Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for malaria, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nMigraine headache. Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for migraine headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nOtitis media. It is unclear if nasal or oral echinacea is beneficial for preventing otitis media in children. Additionally, some data suggest that echinacea is not beneficial for treating otitis media in children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 years shows that taking various formulations of echinacea nasally or orally reduces the risk of an episode of otitis media by about 44%. However, there was not a reduction in otitis media treatment duration (117141). The validity of these results may be limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including dose, form, and formulation of echinacea.\n\nIn one clinical study, included in that analysis above, taking a specific liquid extract of echinacea fresh roots and dried mature seeds, 0.5 mL three times daily for 3 days at the first sign of a common cold, followed by 0.25 mL three times daily for 7 days, does not prevent otitis media in children 1-5 years of age with a history of recurrent otitis media. In fact, the risk of an episode of otitis media during the 6 month follow-up seemed to increase by 59% in those taking echinacea when compared with placebo (20063).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there has been interest in using topical echinacea for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for preventing or treating respiratory tract infections.\nA large clinical study in adults with respiratory tract infections shows that using echinacea spray or taking echinacea lozenges 16,800 mg daily during days 1-3 and 2240-3360 mg daily afterward for up to 10 days does not improve time to recovery, symptom relief, or number of sick days when compared with echinacea tablets or drops at a prophylactic dose of 2400 mg daily for 10 days. However, the higher dose from days 1-3 is associated with faster viral clearance than the prophylactic dose (111540). The validity of these effects is limited by insufficient blinding and a lack of a placebo group.\n\nAdditionally, echinacea has been studied for prevention of respiratory tract infections. A meta-analysis of many clinical trials shows that taking echinacea up to 16,800 mg daily, alone or in combination with other products, for up to 17 weeks reduces the risk of respiratory infection and antibiotic prescriptions when compared with control (114568). The validity of this study is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population, dose, and outcome definitions and measurements.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nTonsillitis. Oral echinacea has been used with azithromycin to reduce relapses of recurrent tonsillitis in children. A throat spray containing echinacea has also been evaluated for tonsillitis-associated sore throat. It is unclear if echinacea is beneficial for either purpose.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with recurrent tonsillitis shows that adding echinacea suspension, 250 mg root powder per 5 mL, orally 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days per month for 6 months, to azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for 6 consecutive days per month for 6 months reduces the number of tonsillitis attacks when compared with azithromycin alone (104127). However, the study was not blinded and the number of tonsillitis episodes in both groups was very low. Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying a throat spray containing sage and echinacea whole plant extract every 2 hours up to 10 times daily for up to 5 consecutive days is as effective as a chlorhexidine-lidocaine spray in patients with sore throat due to acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis (20077).\nless\nTonsillopharyngitis. Oral echinacea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized study in patients aged 12-75 years with acute tonsillopharyngitis shows that taking lozenges containing echinacea extract 800 mg and sage extract 5 times daily for 4 days reduces throat pain and tonsillopharyngitis symptoms when compared to baseline, both acutely within 90 minutes and after 4 days of treatment (111530). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to echinacea, sage, or the combination.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for preventing or treating URTIs.\nA moderate-size open-label clinical study tested the effects of echinacea to prevent or treat respiratory viruses. This study of otherwise healthy adults in Bulgaria shows that taking echinacea extract (Echinaforce, A. Vogel AG) 2400 mg daily for cycles of 2, 2, and 1 months, with a 1-week break between each cycle, does not reduce symptomatic respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV-2, or respiratory virus detection overall when compared with usual care. However, echinacea extract does reduce the risk of a positive test for coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 by 48% and 63%, respectively. In patients who develop a symptomatic respiratory tract infection, this study also shows that taking the same echinacea extract 4000 mg daily for up to 10 days speeds viral clearance compared with usual care when all virus types were analyzed; however, clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was not improved. Echinacea may also reduce the number of days with a fever, but not other symptoms (111174). The validity of this study is limited by lack of blinding. Further, most patients were unvaccinated against COVID-19; it is unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to vaccinated patients.\n\nEchinacea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A large study in adults with URTIs shows that taking a combination product containing echinacea 1100-2200 mg, zinc, and vitamin C (EZC Pak) daily for 5 days reduces time to recovery by 1.4 days but does not reduce symptom severity when compared with placebo (111512). The validity of these effects is severely limited by multiple instances of selection bias. Another small clinical study in adults with a history of frequent URTI shows that taking a combination oral product containing echinacea, chokeberry, and honeysuckle 300 mg twice daily for 60 days reduces the number of patients reporting multiple URTI symptoms concurrently, but not the number of patients reporting cough, fever, or nasal symptoms (116242). In both studies, it is unclear whether these effects are due to echinacea, the other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nEchinacea has also been evaluated in children. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 years shows that taking echinacea nasally or orally reduces the relative risk of developing an URTI by 19%. In addition, antibiotic prescriptions and treatment duration may be reduced in children taking echinacea compared to placebo (117141). However, the validity of this analysis is limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including population; dose, form and formulation of echinacea, and study methodology.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nVaginal candidiasis. Although there has been interest in using oral echinacea for vaginal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of echinacea for this purpose.\nWarts. It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for warts when used alone or in combination with other ingredients.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking echinacea 600 mg orally once daily for up to 3 months does not clear common, plantar, or plain cutaneous warts any more effectively than placebo (20080). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking an oral supplement containing echinacea with methionine, zinc, probiotics, antioxidants and immunostimulants for 6 months, in addition to using conventional topical therapy to treat cutaneous warts, seems to increase the rate of complete remission from 54% to 86% when compared with conventional therapy alone (20071). It is unclear if these effects are due to echinacea, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWater warts. It is unclear if oral echinacea is beneficial for water warts (molluscum contagiosum).\nIn children who have been successfully treated with curettage for molluscum contagiosum, taking a combination of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea orally daily for 2 months is associated with a relapse rate of about 39%, compared with a rate of 68% in a control group that received no oral treatment (104128). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo control. E. angustifolia and E. purpurea were taken in doses of 200 mg each in children under 20 kg and 400 mg each in children over 20 kg.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate echinacea for these uses.",

This may increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nSeveral clinical trials have shown that taking echinacea for up to one month does not significantly affect the metabolism of various CYP3A4 substrates, including midazolam, docetaxel, etravirine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and darunavir-ritonavir (13712, 48618, 88164, 88165). However, other clinical research shows that echinacea may increase the clearance of midazolam, suggesting that echinacea might induce CYP3A4 (48618). The discrepancy is thought to be due to differing effects of echinacea on intestinal versus hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes. Echinacea appears to induce hepatic CYP3A4 but inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 (12155). In some cases, these effects might cancel each other out, but in others, drug levels may be increased or decreased depending on the level of effect at hepatic and intestinal sites. The effect of echinacea on CYP3A4 activity may differ depending on the CYP3A4 substrate (6450, 11026, 88162, 88167).\nless\nDARUNAVIR (Prezista)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, echinacea may interfere with the metabolism of darunavir; however, a small clinical study found no effect.\nDarunavir is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is administered with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir to increase its plasma concentrations.

Advise patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pemphigus vulgaris, or others to avoid or use echinacea with caution.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with echinacea.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe oral bioavailability of echinacea is variable, depending on the preparation used. One clinical study compared the oral bioavailability of liquid and tablet formulations of a specific echinacea extract (Echinaforce, A. Vogel Bioforce AG) at a dose of 0.07 mg of the major alkamides. The tincture produced a maximum concentration of 0.40 ng/mL occurred after 30 minutes; the tablets produced a maximum concentration of 0.12 ng/mL after 45 minutes (48576). Using 2.5 mL of a 60% ethanolic extract of E. angustifolia root, containing a total of 169 ng of six isobutylamides, a peak plasma level of 10.88 ng/mL occurred 30 minutes after the dose (48560). Another small pharmacokinetic study showed a maximum concentration of 7.7 ng/mL occurring 0.7 hours after taking a 10 mg capsule containing an alkamide lipophilic extract isolated from E. angustifolia (Echinamid, Indena Milan) (95649). Compared to echinacea extract, tablets, and throat spray, the lipophilic soft gel formulation increased tetraene bioavailability by 3.5 times. The oral clearance of this preparation was found to be 60.8 L/hour.\nMetabolism\nIn preliminary research using a human liver microsome preparation, the primary cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of N-isobutyldodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z-tetraenamide, one of the most common alkamide components of echinacea, were CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 (48611).\nExcretion\nThe half-life after oral administration of a 10 mg capsule of the alkamide lipophilic extract isolated from E. angustifolia (Echinamid, Indena Milan) was 1.3 hours (95649).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the three echinacea species used medicinally (Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, and Echinacea pallida) are the above ground parts and the roots. Although these species are often used interchangeably, there is very little research comparing them (13417). Constituents of echinacea include alkamides such as dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z(E)-tetraenoic acid isobutylamides, N-isobutyldodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z-tetraenamide, and undeca-2-ene-8,10-diynoic acid isobutylamide (48560, 48602, 48605, 48609, 48611, 48627, 48638). Other constituents include caffeic acid derivatives, caffeoyl derivatives , cichoric acid , cynarin , dodecanoic and undecanoic acid derivatives , pentadeca-(8Z,13Z)-dien-11-yn-2-one, echinacoside , unsaturated N-alkamide lipids, and polysaccharides (13417, 48560, 48582, 48585, 48591, 48595, 48597, 48606, 48617, 48619).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBased on cell culture research, the alkamides of E. purpurea, E. pallida, and E. angustifolia are believed to induce anti-inflammatory effects (48609). A specific alkamide, dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z(E)-tetraenoic acid isobutylamide, inhibits the expression and activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta in macrophages (48609). A clinical study in 10 healthy people showed that the same alkamide inhibits the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-8, while increasing the expression of the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-10 (95649). In vitro research also suggests that other constituents of echinacea might inhibit cyclooxygenases and 5-lipoxygenase (10798, 10799). Serum ferritin, which appears to be an indicator of inflammatory cytokines, is lowered in people treated with echinacea (10797).\nAntibacterial effects\nEchinacea may possess bactericidal activity against Listeria monocytogenes (48662). In cell culture research, a dose-dependent anti-adhesion effect of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia was observed against Campylobacter jejuni, a common bacterial cause of diarrhea (48629). In other cell culture research, a preparation of E. purpurea had bactericidal activity against Propionibacterium acnes, a common cause of acne (48620).\nAntifungal effects\nPolyacetylenic compounds in echinacea, including ketoalkenes and ketoalkynes, seem to have antifungal activity, including activity against Candida albicans yeast (6390, 48662).\nAntioxidant effects\nProposed mechanisms of antioxidant activity of echinacea root extracts include free radical scavenging and transition metal chelating effects (48529). In laboratory research, macromolecular glycoconjugates extracted from E. purpurea protected platelet proteins from peroxynitrite-induced nitrative and oxidative damage, although the activity was less than that of resveratrol (48622).\n\nIn laboratory research, echinacea exhibited peroxynitrite-scavenging activity and may inhibit DNA single breaks, tyrosine nitration, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. These effects may be due to cichoric acid (48617).\nAntiviral effects\nEchinacea may exhibit antiviral activity against influenza virus (48615), vesicular stomach virus, and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2 (48664). Preliminary research using viruses from nasal secretions suggests that E. purpurea might inhibit enveloped viruses such as corona, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial viruses, and metapneumovirus (18225). A clinical study shows that echinacea reduces viral shedding when combined with sage extract (111530).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nEchinacea appears to modestly inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) in vivo. Clinical research using caffeine as a probe for CYP1A2 activity has demonstrated that echinacea can inhibit caffeine clearance by 27% (12155). Data on the effects of echinacea on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) are conflicting, with induction (11026, 12155, 48618), inhibition (6450, 11026, 12155, 88162, 88167), and no effect (13712, 88164, 88165) all being reported. These differences may be due to variation in the echinacea species and plant parts used, the presence of other herbs in combination, and the specific binding site of the drug substrate to the CYP3A4 enzyme (6450, 11026, 88162, 88167). Echinacea does not seem to affect cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) or 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymes (12155).\nImmunologic effects\nThe immunostimulatory properties of echinacea appear to target both nonspecific and specific immune function. Nonspecific effects include increases in macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis, as well as secretion of interferon beta-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (3279, 6388, 6389, 12639, 48562, 48563, 48564, 48565, 48656, 48663). Constituents of echinacea involved include high-molecular weight polysaccharides such as heteroxylan and arabinogalactan, and lower molecular weight compounds including alkylamides, and caffeoyl conjugates such as chicoric acid and echinacosides (3279, 12639).\n\nSpecific immune responses include the activation of alternate complement pathway components and increasing levels and activity of T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells (10725, 48544, 48566). These effects may be due to polysaccharides in echinacea (18226).\nWound-healing effects\nAnimal research suggests that echinacea extracts can speed wound healing, enhance epithelialization, and reduce inflammation (10798, 13417). The echinacoside constituent seems to protect type III collagen from free radical damage, and may have activity against bacterial hyaluronidase, which is necessary for bacteria to spread through skin and mucous membranes (13417, 18226, 48644). Preliminary data suggest that the caffeoyl constituents of echinacea might help treat or prevent UV radiation-induced skin damage by protecting collagen from free radical damage (8227)."

All patients in this study increased physical activity and consumed a diet with a mild caloric restriction (106334). Conversely, other clinical research in a similar population shows that taking Ecklonia cava polyphenols 144 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces body fat ratio by 7% and body weight, BMI, and waist circumference by 2%. These improvements were statistically significant when compared with placebo. Furthermore, taking Ecklonia cava polyphenols 72 mg or 144 mg daily reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 10% and 14%, respectively, when compared with placebo (96376).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEcklonia cava contains specific polyphenols called phlorotannins. These are polymers of phloroglucinol and include eckols and triphlorethol-A (17002, 17003, 106334, 106335, 113108). The eckols include 6,6'-bieckol, 8,8'-bieckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol (96376, 96377, 113106, 113108). Ecklonia cava also contains sterol derivatives, including fucosterol, ergosterol, and cholesterol (17010), monosaccharides, and polysaccharides (113109).\nAnti-aging effects\nPhlorotannins in Ecklonia cava inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in vitro. MMP inhibitors are thought to have a role in preventing wrinkle formation (17004).\nAnti-arthritis effects\nThere is interest in Ecklonia cava for preventing osteoarthritis due to the antioxidant and potential anti-inflammatory effects of Ecklonia cava constituents. In addition to antioxidant effects, phlorotannin-rich extracts of Ecklonia cava appear to reduce production of inflammatory prostaglandins and inhibit interleukin-1 alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (17002, 17005, 17009). Also, phlorotannins in Ecklonia cava inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in vitro. MMP inhibitors are thought to have a role in preventing osteoarthritis (17004).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nThere is interest in using Ecklonia cava to prevent asthmatic attacks. Ecklonia cava is thought to have anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects that might reduce asthma exacerbation. In animal models, administering Ecklonia cava extract appears to decrease experimentally induced airway hyper-responsiveness, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels, and inflammatory cytokines (17006). Additionally, research in a rodent model of allergic asthma shows that fermented Ecklonia cava inhibits activation of mast cells; inhibits production of immunoglobulin E and G, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); inhibits infiltration of bronchoalveolar fluid by lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils; and increases IL-2, IL-10, and IL-12 after exposure to the allergen (113106).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in Ecklonia cava for preventing cancer. In vitro, the eckols of Ecklonia cava protect lung fibroblasts against oxidative damage (16819, 17001). Crude polyphenol extracts of Ecklonia cava also seem to decrease proliferation of cancer cells in vitro (17001). Phlorotannins in Ecklonia cava also inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in vitro. MMP inhibitors are thought to have a role in preventing cancer metastasis (17004).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHuman research shows that taking Ecklonia cava polyphenols reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (106335). Research in a rodent model of allergic asthma shows that Ecklonia cava reduces markers of inflammation in the serum and lungs (113106), and research in rat models of obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome shows that Ecklonia cava reduces levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (113107, 113108).\nAnti-microbial effects\nEcklonia cava constituents appear to have antibacterial and antiviral effects. In vitro, a phloroglucinol derivative contained in Ecklonia cava inhibits replication and cell entry of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (17008).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThere is interest in using Ecklonia cava to alter body composition. In overweight adults, Ecklonia cava increased urinary levels of riboflavin, urocanic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-methoxyindole glucuronide, and guanidino valeric acid. However, only the increases in riboflavin were correlated with beneficial changes in body weight and fat mass; increases in urocanic acid were associated with decreases in the waist-to-hip ratio (106332). It is unclear how riboflavin or urocanic acid might play a role in body composition. Some research suggests that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of Ecklonia cava phlorotannins play a role in changes in body composition (106334, 113108). Other research in a rat model of obesity suggests that Ecklonia cava extract and its constituents may decrease fat mass by decreasing lipid accumulation in pre-adipocytes; downregulating expression of fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, SREBP-1C, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma); upregulating the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue; decreasing leptin and gastric inhibitory peptides; and increasing ghrelin (113108, 113109). In vitro research also suggests that Ecklonia cava extract suppresses preadipocyte differentiation (113108).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn adults with prediabetes, Ecklonia cava constituents, such as dieckol, reduce postprandial glucose levels and protect cells from oxidative damage caused by hyperglycemia. However, they do not seem to reduce fasting blood glucose or insulin sensitivity (96375, 113110). It has also been theorized that Ecklonia cava extracts or constituents may have alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity thereby decreasing the postprandial glucose response (113110).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human research, Ecklonia cava phlorotannins reduced levels of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, without effecting levels of malondialdehyde (106334). In vitro and animal research shows that Ecklonia cava extract increases mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) activity, decreases mitochondrial reaction oxygen species generation, and increases free radical scavenging activity (113105, 113108). Also, phlorotannin constituents of Ecklonia cava have antioxidant effects and inhibit lipid peroxidation in vitro (16819, 17002).\nExercise performance effects\nIn one small clinical study, Ecklonia cava polyphenols improved exercise endurance. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, the polyphenols seem to increase utilization of glucose and reduce the production of lactate (96377). Also, the polyphenols might have vasodilatory effects (96376).\nHormonal effects\nThere has been interest in Ecklonia cava for the treatment of hormonal disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Research in a rat model of PCOS shows that Ecklonia cava extract reduces luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels and improves the ratio of the number of cystic follicles to the number of mature follicles (113107).\nRadioprotective effects\nPhlorotannins from Ecklonia cava appear to protect against gamma-ray radiation exposure. In vitro research shows that triphlorethol-A from Ecklonia cava reduces oxidative cellular damage caused by radiation exposure (17003). The eckols also seem to decrease mortality in animal models of lethal irradiation (17007).\nVascular effects\nEcklonia cava extract may decrease vascular calcification, particularly hypertension-related vascular calcification. A combination of in vitro research in mouse vascular aortic smooth muscle cells and in vivo research in a rat model of hypertension shows that Ecklonia cava extract decreases aortic vascular calcification via increasing mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) and mitosirtum3 (SIRT3), which together upregulate manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) activity. This decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA damage, thereby decreasing vascular calcification. This extract also decreases osteoblast-like phenotype changes in the vascular smooth muscle cells and medial calcification in the aortas of hypertensive rats (113105)."

Specific formulations of eggshell membrane (NEM, ESM Technologies, LLC) are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the United States when used as a food ingredient in quantities no greater than 500 mg per serving (115153).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of eggshell membrane when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nEggshell membrane seems to be well tolerated. Clinical studies have not identified a significant difference in the rate of adverse effects between eggshell membrane and placebo.",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Oral eggshell membrane may modestly reduce pain and improve function in adults with knee osteoarthritis, although it is unclear if these changes would be considered clinically significant.\nMeta-analyses of 5 clinical trials in adults with knee osteoarthritis show that eggshell membrane may modestly improve pain and function, but not stiffness, when compared with placebo; however, studies using a visual analog scale (VAS) to evaluate pain showed no benefit when compared with placebo. It is unclear if the small improvements in pain, such as 6-7 points on the 96-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, would be considered clinically significant (115152). A sub-analysis in one clinical study that utilized VAS suggests that pain reduction may be dose-dependent, with modest improvement seen in those taking 500 mg daily, but not those taking 300 mg daily, for 8 weeks (115136). These studies utilized eggshell membrane (BiovaFlex, Biova, LLC; Eggbrane, Eggbrane; ESM, Torolis Explotaciones; NEM, ESM Technologies, LLC) in doses of 300-500 mg daily for 8-12 weeks (115128, 115136, 115152, 117111, 117112).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral or topical eggshell membrane is beneficial for aging skin.\nA small open-label study in females aged 45-65 years with wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes shows that applying a cream providing 8% hydrolyzed eggshell membrane daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces wrinkle roughness, contour, and depth when compared to baseline (116800). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nOral eggshell membrane has also been investigated. A clinical study in middle-aged adults shows that taking hydrolyzed eggshell membrane (BiovaBio, Biova, LLC-Johnston) 450 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the depth or thickness of fine lines around the eyes, or most measures of skin color evenness, when compared with placebo (116796).\nless\nJoint pain. It is unclear if oral eggshell membrane is beneficial for joint pain after exercise.\nA small clinical trial in postmenopausal adults undergoing an exercise program designed to put stress on the knee shows that taking eggshell membrane (NEM, ESM Technologies, LLC) 500 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces exercise-induced joint stiffness and pain on day 2 and day 4, respectively, when compared with placebo. Knee pain immediately post-exercise was no different between groups (115129).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral eggshell membrane is beneficial for muscle strength in older adults.\nA small clinical trial in healthy home-dwelling adults at least 70 years of age shows that taking micronized eggshell membrane 500 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve muscle strength or balance when compared with placebo (115151). This small study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if oral eggshell membrane is beneficial for chronic musculoskeletal pain.\nDetails: A small crossover study in adults with mild to moderate chronic pain of the neck, spine, hips, and/or knees shows that taking eggshell membrane (BiovaFlex, Biova, LLC) 450 mg daily for 4 weeks modestly improves physical activity levels and range of motion in the neck and dominant shoulder, but does not reduce average pain scores, when compared with placebo (116799). Two small clinical trials in adults with mild to moderate chronic pain related to joint and connective tissue disorders show that taking eggshell membrane (NEM, ESM Technologies, LLC) 500 mg daily for 30 days modestly improves pain and flexibility when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (115131). The validity of each of these studies is limited by the enrollment of heterogeneous patient populations with varying sources and forms of chronic pain.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nEggshell membrane is available in crude/native, enzymatically digested, or hydrolyzed water-soluble formulations (115128, 115129, 115131, 116799, 116802). One specific product (BiovaFlex) provides water-soluble hydrolyzed eggshell membrane containing approximately 22% collagen, 25% elastin, and 18% glycosaminoglycans (116802).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEggshell membrane is the membrane that lines the inside of the shell of the chicken egg (115128, 115129, 116799, 116808). It is approximately 90% protein/amino acid and is rich in collagen types I, V, and X, elastin, glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin, dermatan sulfates, hyaluronic acid, and hexosamines such as glucosamine (115136, 116802, 116804, 116808). Eggshell membrane also contains the proteins ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, and lysozyme (116804).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nEggshell membrane is of interest for joint health. It appears to modestly reduce joint pain in humans and animal models (115135, 115150, 115152). In an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, eggshell membrane modestly reduced synovitis, pannus formation, bone resorption, periosteal bone formation, and cartilage damage (115135). Possible mechanisms of action include the inhibition of joint inflammation and subsequent cartilage degradation. In humans, eggshell membrane reduces levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (115151). In animal models, eggshell membrane seems to inhibit the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 (115135, 115150). In humans, oral eggshell membrane modestly reduces urinary levels of C-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of type II collagen (CTX-II), a measure of cartilage degradation, after 1 and 2 weeks of use (115129). This has also been observed in animal models of arthritis (115135, 115150). In an animal model of late-stage osteoarthritis, eggshell membrane also reduces levels of cartilage-degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 13, and increases levels of cartilage protein components (115150).\nAnti-hyperuricemic effects\nIn an animal model of gout, eggshell membrane reduces serum levels of uric acid, possibly by increasing the renal excretion of uric acid and reducing kidney inflammation (116798).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of topically applied eggshell membrane might play a role in skin care. In vitro, water-soluble eggshell membrane has shown direct and indirect antioxidant effects, including the induction of some antioxidant response element (ARE) antioxidant genes (116800, 116803).\nDermatologic effects\nEggshell membrane is of interest for skin care, including anti-aging and wound healing effects. Although not all research agrees (116796), one small clinical study shows that topical application of eggshell membrane modestly reduces wrinkle roughness, contour, and depth (116800). In animal models, topical eggshell membrane formulations seem to reduce wound healing time (116797, 116801). Although the mechanism of action is unclear, topical eggshell membrane seems to have protective effects on skin moisture levels in humans (116803). In animal models, eggshell membrane maintains skin thickness, possibly by increasing the expression of specific growth factors (115137, 116806). At wound edges, eggshell membrane seems to increase keratinocyte cell proliferation and the activity of some matrix metalloproteinases (115132).\n\nIn vitro, eggshell membrane seems to stimulate the proliferation and adhesion of dermal fibroblasts, as well as the dermal fibroblast production of elastin and collagen (115132, 115137, 116800). Hydrolyzed eggshell membrane also seems to stimulate the differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes, possibly by affecting the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation (116806). Eggshell membrane seems to stimulate the production of hyaluronan by keratinocytes (115137). It also seems to inhibit collagenase and elastase, the enzymes involved in the breakdown of collagen and elastin, respectively (116803).\nGastrointestinal effects\nEggshell membrane is of interest for gastrointestinal health due to the presence of digestion-resistant proteins. In animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, eggshell membrane seems to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms and colonic inflammation and improve survival (116805, 117113). In various animal models, eggshell membrane seems to increase the diversity of gut microbiota and/or normalize levels and activity of beneficial microbiota, although the mechanism of action is unclear (115127, 115151, 116805).\nHair growth effects\nThere is interest in using eggshell membrane to improve hair growth and thickness. However, one clinical study in middle-aged adults shows that taking hydrolyzed eggshell membrane (BiovaBio, Biova, LLC-Johnston) 450 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve hair density or breakage rate when compared with placebo (116796).\nHypolipidemic effects\nEggshell membrane is of interest for improving dyslipidemia due to the presence of digestion-resistant proteins. In a study of mice fed a high-fat diet, adding 8% eggshell membrane powder to the diet reduces levels of plasma triglycerides and liver cholesterol when compared with the high-fat diet alone (115127).\nMuscular effects\nEggshell membrane is a rich source of protein and is of interest for maintaining skeletal muscle. In aged mice, eggshell membrane seems to maintain muscle strength and attenuate muscle atrophy and loss. The mechanism of action is unclear but may be related to anti-inflammatory activity and modulation of protein synthesis and degradation (115151)."

            "Overview": "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) is a 20-carbon long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is found along with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in the liver and tissues of marine mammals and oily fish. It is also found in some species of microalgae (8696, 8698, 103314).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when fish oil or prescription EPA is used orally and appropriately as a source of EPA. Fish oil containing EPA has been used safely for up to 7 years (1016, 7819, 15497). While doses of prescription EPA (Vascepa, formerly ARM101, Amarin) have been used safely at doses up to 4 grams daily (91409, 91410, 95715, 99136), there is some concern that high intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA might increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), another omega-3 fatty acid also found in fish oil, to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when algal oil is used orally and appropriately as a source of EPA. A specific algal oil supplement (Almega PL) providing EPA 250 mg daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks (103314). ...when used intravenously under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid lipid emulsions containing EPA, administered intravenously for 1-4 weeks, have been safely used (1004, 66042, 66421, 89323).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Doses greater than 3 grams daily might decrease blood coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of EPA plus DHA, another omega-3 fatty acid, to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739). Additionally, clinical research on the use prescription omega-3 ethyl esters in doses of at least 4 grams daily has found an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in adults with a history of atrial fibrillation or flutter, cardiovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk factors (114311, 116881, 116882).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, prescription EPA or EPA derived from fish oil is generally well tolerated in doses of up to 3 grams daily. Agal oil providing EPA seems to be well tolerated. Doses of EPA greater than 3 grams daily are possibly unsafe.\n\nIntravenously, fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid lipid emulsions containing EPA seem to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Belching, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, fishy aftertaste, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Some case reports raise concerns about increased risk of bleeding with high doses.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, taking the prescription ethyl-EPA product (Vascepa, Amarin) 4 grams daily has been linked to a 1% greater risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter that required hospitalization when compared with placebo (101286). New-onset atrial fibrillation was also more likely to occur in adults with stable cardiovascular disease who were taking 1800 mg daily of a highly purified ethyl-EPA product in another clinical trial (117232). Prescription fish oil products in the U.S. must carry a warning regarding the risk for recurrent atrial fibrillation and flutter in adults taking 4-8 grams of fish oil daily (116881, 116882). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also updated the product information for omega-3 acid ethyl esters to include an increased risk of atrial fibrillation when taken in doses of 4 grams daily. The EMA recommends cessation of use if atrial fibrillation develops (114311).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, reported side effects of EPA have included skin rash and itching (15497).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, reported side effects of EPA have included nausea, diarrhea, and epigastric discomfort (15497, 103314, 110365, 110366, 115180, 117232). For fish oils containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, side effects can include fishy taste, belching, nausea, and loose stools (10007).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, reported side effects of EPA, as well as fish oils containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have included nosebleed (10007, 15497). There is some concern that taking high doses of oils providing EPA along with DHA might decrease blood coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). To reduce this risk, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of EPA plus DHA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739). The prescription ethyl-EPA product (Vascepa, Amarin) 4 grams daily has been linked to bleeding in 12% of patients, compared with 10% in the placebo group. Serious bleeding occurred in 3% of the Vascepa group compared to 2% in the placebo group (101286).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere is preliminary evidence that the EPA in fish oil decreases natural killer (NK) cell activity. Due to this effect, there is concern that increased intake of EPA might have some adverse immunologic effects and possibly increase the risk for viral infections and some cancers (8718).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, EPA may cause musculoskeletal pain in some patients, although results from clinical research are conflicting. In one clinical study, a higher percentage of patients treated with ethyl-EPA 2 or 4 grams daily experienced joint pain compared to placebo (3.4% and 1.7% vs 0.4%, respectively) (91409). However, in another study, slightly fewer patients taking ethyl-EPA 1.8 grams daily experienced joint, lumbar, or muscle pain compared to placebo (1.6% vs 2.0%, respectively) (15497).\nless\nOncologic\nThree people with pre-existing familial adenomatous polyposis have been diagnosed with malignant lesions during the course of long-term high-docosahexaenoic acid fish oil use (999); however, it is unclear if fish oil, or more specifically EPA, was the cause.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nHypertriglyceridemia. Oral prescription ethyl-EPA 4 grams daily reduces triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, especially in severe cases. It is unclear if oral EPA supplements are beneficial in hypertriglyceridemia.\nA specific ethyl-EPA product (Vascepa, formerly ARM101, Amarin) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used at a dose of 4 grams daily with diet modification to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical research shows that taking 4 grams daily in two divided doses for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 33%, total cholesterol by 16%, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by 29%, and apolipoprotein B by 9% when compared with placebo (91410). In patients taking statins with persistent elevated triglyceride levels (between 200 mg/dL and 500 mg/dL), this prescription product reduces triglyceride levels by about 22% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 6% when compared with placebo (91409). In females with diabetes taking statins with persistent elevated triglyceride levels, this product reduces triglyceride levels by about 21.5% and total cholesterol levels by 12.5%, but does not reduce levels of LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (99136). Furthermore, a large clinical trial (REDUCE-IT) in patients with LDL cholesterol levels controlled with statin therapy, but with persistent elevated triglyceride levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, shows that this product reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% when compared with placebo after a median follow-up of 4.9 years. The number of these patients needed to be treated to prevent one major adverse cardiovascular event is 21 (95715).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypertriglyceridemia also shows that taking a specific self-emulsifying ethyl-EPA (MND-2119, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 2 grams or 4 grams once daily for 52 weeks reduces levels of triglycerides by 16.7% and 21.0%, respectively, compared with baseline (110365). This study is uncontrolled and open-label.\n\nThere is no strong evidence that EPA SUPPLEMENTS reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral prescription ethyl-EPA seems to reduce the risk of CVD events when used as an adjunct to statin therapy in patients with CVD risk. It is unclear if oral EPA supplements are beneficial in CVD.\nA specific ethyl EPA product (Vascepa, Amarin) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used as an adjunct to statin therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in adult patients with elevated triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL) and CVD or diabetes mellitus and at least two additional risk factors for CVD (101286). This approval was mostly due to evidence from a large clinical trial (REDUCE-IT). For patients in the REDUCE-IT trial on statin therapy with persistent elevated triglyceride levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, taking Vascepa 4 grams daily reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% when compared to placebo after a median follow-up of 4.9 years. To prevent one major cardiovascular event, 21 patients need to be treated (95715). A meta-analysis of this and 3 other clinical trials investigating the effect of EPA, usually as ethyl ester, on CVD outcomes in adults taking statins shows that adding EPA modestly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, but not stroke, when compared with statins alone (114312).\n\nAnother highly purified ethyl EPA product has been investigated for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with stable coronary artery disease and low plasma EPA status who are taking statins. A large, open-label clinical trial (RESPECT-EPA) shows that adding EPA 1800 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses reduces the relative composite risk of a fatal or nonfatal secondary cardiovascular event by up to 27% over an average follow-up of 5 years when compared with statins alone. However, there was no reduction in the risk for the individual events that comprised this composite endpoint, which included cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization.\nless\nDepression. Oral EPA seems to reduce symptoms of depression, especially in patients already being treated with conventional antidepressants.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that pure EPA or omega-3 fatty acid enriched in EPA (at least 60%) moderately reduces depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and those with depressive symptomatology but no diagnosis of MDD (90680, 66129, 102391). The beneficial effect of EPA appears to be dose-dependent in patients with MDD but not in those with depressive symptomatology (90680). The duration of treatment and the age of the patients do not appear to influence the effects of EPA (66129).\n\nPatients already being treated with conventional antidepressant medications may benefit more from EPA than those not taking antidepressants. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking ethyl-EPA orally 500 mg to 1 gram twice daily with standard therapy improves symptoms of recurrent major depression, such as depressed mood, guilty feelings, worthlessness, and insomnia, after 2-4 weeks of treatment (10215, 10872). A 1 gram per day dose of ethyl-EPA may be more effective for depression than 2 grams per day (10215). However, in patients not using standard therapy, taking EPA-enriched omega-3 fatty acid (ProEPA Xtra, NordicNaturals) standardized to contain EPA 1060 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 274 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce symptoms of depression in patients with MDD (90691).\n\nSome research suggests that EPA may help prevent the development of major depression in patients treated with interferon-alpha. Clinical research shows that only 10% of patients taking EPA 3.5 grams daily for 2 weeks prior to the start of interferon-alpha therapy experience major depression during the 24 weeks of interferon-alpha treatment compared to 30% of patients taking placebo. Also, the onset of depression is delayed from approximately 5.3 weeks to 12 weeks (90710).\n\nBased on these and other findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids providing 1-2 grams EPA are recommended for adjunctive use in patients with major depressive disorder. However, omega-3 fatty acids are not recommended as monotherapy and products containing other doses of EPA are not recommended as adjunctive or monotherapy in these patients (110318).\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral EPA may reduce the number of days with a migraine each month in some adults with chronic or episodic migraine.\nA clinical study in adults in China with episodic migraines shows that taking EPA as ethyl ester 1.8 grams daily from fish oil for 12 weeks reduces the number of days with a migraine by 4.4 per month and the number of days using acute medication by 1.3 per month compared with 0.6 and 0.1 days per month, respectively, in patients taking placebo. About 80% of the adults in this study were female; benefits were only seen in this population (114184). Another trial in adults in Iran with chronic migraines shows that taking purified ethyl EPA 1000 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of days with migraine by 9.8 per month compared with a reduction of 4.6 per month in patients taking placebo. The use of acute medication was also reduced when compared with placebo; however, migraine severity and frequency were not affected (115180).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Oral prescription ethyl-EPA reduces the risk of MI when used as an adjunct to statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Oral EPA supplements also seem to be beneficial for this purpose.\nA specific ethyl-EPA product (Vascepa, Amarin) 4 grams daily is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used as an adjunct to statin therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in adult patients with elevated triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL) and CVD or diabetes mellitus and at least two additional risk factors for CVD (101286).\n\nMost evidence also shows that other sources of EPA are beneficial. A meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials investigating the effect of both FDA-approved and supplemental EPA, usually as ethyl ester, on CVD outcomes in adults taking statins shows that adding EPA modestly reduces the risk of MI when compared with statins alone (114312). Clinical research in adults with acute MI shows that taking EPA 1.8 grams daily along with pitavastatin 2 mg daily for one month starting within 24 hours of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces the incidence of adverse cardiac events, including cardiac death, stroke, re-infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, by 64% when compared with pitavastatin alone. In particular, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is reduced by about 66% for patients treated with EPA plus pitavastatin compared to pitavastatin alone (91411). Taking this same dose of EPA along with the same dose of pitavastatin for one year after PCI in patients with acute MI also reduces the absolute risk of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or coronary revascularization by 11% when compared to pitavastatin alone. The reduction in cardiovascular events after one year was largely due to a decrease in cardiovascular deaths by about 6% (96420). There is also evidence that taking EPA 1.8 grams daily along with pitavastatin 4 mg daily for 6-8 months following PCI for acute coronary syndrome reduces plaque lipid volume by 20% when compared to pitavastatin alone (96419).\n\nOne clinical study also shows that taking EPA 0.9 grams twice daily along with statins for one month prior to undergoing PCI might reduce the incidence of periprocedural (type IV) MI by approximately 25% when compared to statins alone (91412).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for AMD prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that increased dietary consumption of EPA does not prevent AMD (10324). Other population research suggests that higher blood levels of EPA are associated with a lower odds of developing AMD. However, the overall evidence is weak (112095).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for Alzheimer disease prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that higher dietary intake of EPA is not associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (15041).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for atopic dermatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral EPA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome research shows that low plasma levels of EPA and other fatty acids are associated with ADHD in children (15496); however, it is not known if taking EPA supplements can treat or prevent ADHD. Supplemental EPA has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in drug-naïve Italian children ages 6-12 years with mild to moderate ADHD shows that taking EPA 279 mg in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) daily for 12 months does not improve inattentive symptoms, global functioning, or learning skills when compared with placebo. This study also did not identify a correlation between plasma fatty acid levels and ADHD symptoms (111058).\nless\nBehcet disease. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for Behcet disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nBipolar disorder. Oral fish oil in doses providing 1-2 grams EPA may be beneficial for symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder. It is unclear if EPA alone is beneficial.\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses standardized to 1-2 grams EPA are weakly recommended for adjunctive use in bipolar depression (110318). This recommendation is based mainly on an early meta-analysis of clinical research of various omega-3 sources (66126). Three clinical trials in this meta-analysis examined the effect of EPA alone in patients with bipolar disorder (110366, 110367, 110368), with only one study in patients also using stable routine treatment examining the effect of ethyl-EPA 1 gram or 2 grams daily for 12 weeks showing benefit on symptoms of depression, but not mania (110366). The largest clinical trial in patients with bipolar disorder shows that taking ethyl-EPA 6 grams daily for 4 months does not improve symptoms of depression or mania (110368). These findings suggest an unclear effect of ethyl-EPA on symptoms of depression, with no evidence of support for improving symptoms of mania. Also, theoretically, fish oil, a source of EPA in some clinical trials, might increase symptoms of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Cases of hypomania have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder using fish oil (5713, 7202).\nless\nBorderline personality disorder. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for improving symptoms of borderline personality disorder.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking ethyl-EPA 1 gram orally daily for 8 weeks modestly improves aggressive behavior and depression in patients with moderately severe borderline personality disorder when compared with placebo (10348).\nless\nCachexia. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for maintaining lean body mass in patients undergoing chemotherapy.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy modestly increases lean body mass by 1.6 kg, on average, compared with a 2 kg LOSS of lean body mass with an isocaloric nutritional supplement (91413). In patients with head and neck cancer, starting EPA 2 grams daily along with a polymeric diet prior to chemotherapy and continuing for 6 weeks results in weight and lean body mass maintenance when compared with baseline. However, this maintenance did not differ statistically from losses of 2.1 kg and 1.3 kg, respectively, in patients using the polymeric diet without EPA (99135). A meta-analysis of eight studies in cancer patients shows that taking EPA, usually alone in doses of 1.5-2.2 grams daily for 4-6 weeks, does not seem to prevent loss of lean body mass when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear how many of the included patients had malnutrition and/or weight loss (106070). Also, this analysis included two studies in which EPA was combined with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish oil.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for preventing diarrhea during treatment with chemotherapy.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin does not seem to prevent diarrhea when compared with taking an isocaloric control nutritional supplement (91413).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for preventing nausea and vomiting during treatment with chemotherapy.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin does not seem to prevent nausea or vomiting when compared with taking an isocaloric control nutritional supplement (91413).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathy during treatment with chemotherapy.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin moderately prevents the development of neuropathy symptoms when compared with taking an isocaloric control nutritional supplement (91413).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for preventing fatigue during treatment with chemotherapy.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin modestly reduces symptoms of fatigue when compared with taking an isocaloric control nutritional supplement (91413).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral EPA alone is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nClinical research in young and middle-aged adults shows that taking an omega-3 supplement providing EPA 900 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 360 mg (Accelon EPA EE, BASF) daily for 6 months improves some measures of cognitive function, including overall speed and overall memory-related accuracy, when compared with both placebo or an omega-3 supplement providing DHA 900 mg and EPA 270 mg daily (Accelon DHA EE, BASF). There were no benefits on other measures of cognitive performance (109215).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Taking oral EPA with aspirin might reduce the development of new colorectal adenomas. However, it is unclear if oral EPA alone is beneficial.\nClinical research in adults determined to be at high risk for colorectal cancer shows that taking EPA 2 grams, with or without aspirin 300 mg, daily for one year does not reduce the rate of adenoma detection during colonoscopy when compared with placebo or aspirin alone. However, the combination of EPA with aspirin seems to reduce the total number of detected adenomas when compared with taking either EPA or aspirin alone (102501).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral EPA alone is beneficial for CHD.\nPopulation research suggests that increased dietary consumption of EPA is associated with a modest decrease in the risk of mortality in patients with CHD (10322). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of CHD who take ethyl-EPA 600 mg three times daily have a 19% reduction in the risk of major coronary events; however, ethyl-EPA doesn't appear to reduce sudden cardiac death (15497).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for cystic fibrosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for glycemic control.\nA small study shows that taking EPA 4 grams daily for 6 weeks does not seem to substantially improve cholesterol, blood sugar, or glycated hemoglobin in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo. However, triglyceride levels are reduced (10321).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral EPA alone is beneficial for preventing exercise-induced muscle damage.\nSmall clinical studies in untrained healthy males show that taking fish oil providing EPA 600 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 260 mg daily for 4-8 weeks prior to exhaustive unaccustomed exercise has beneficial effects on immediate and/or delayed muscle soreness and range of motion when compared with placebo (98257, 109222).\nless\nFractures. Oral EPA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing EPA 330 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 660 mg, for 3 years does not prevent fractures in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nHuntington disease. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for this condition.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical studies in adults with Huntington disease shows that taking EPA 1-2 grams daily for 6 months does not improve motor scores or symptoms when compared with placebo. In two clinical studies that continued for an additional 6 months, EPA supplementation improved total motor score at 12 months. However, the validity of this finding is confounded because the largest clinical trial included in this analysis converted to an open-label design after the first 6 months, eliminating the placebo control and introducing the risk for patient and investigator bias (102505).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for improving lipid levels.\nSmall clinical trials shows that taking EPA alone reduces serum triglyceride concentrations, but has no effect on total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in mildly hypercholesterolemic males (6143, 10322). The effect of EPA on cholesterol levels in other populations has also been evaluated. In patients with type 2 diabetes, EPA can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by approximately 12% (10321). In normolipidemic individuals, an algal oil enriched in EPA reduced levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and total cholesterol but had no effect on triglyceride or LDL cholesterol levels (103314). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking EPA modestly decreases total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (109216). However, not all patients in these studies had hyperlipidemia, and EPA was usually provided in oils that also include docosahexaenoic acid.\nless\nHypertension. Small clinical studies suggest that oral EPA, when used alone or in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not lower blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with dyslipidemia shows that supplemental EPA reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with control (102389). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with slightly elevated diastolic blood pressure (84-94 mmHg) also shows that taking a combination of EPA 0.48 grams plus gamma-linolenic acid 0.12 grams does not reduce diastolic blood pressure (13771). A large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing EPA 330 mg and DHA 660 mg, for 3 years does not reduce blood pressure levels in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly. About 39% of the individuals included in this study were diagnosed with hypertension and about 50% were using antihypertensives (104619).\nless\nIgA nephropathy. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for IgA nephropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is unclear if oral EPA during pregnancy reduces the risk of IUGR.\nA small clinical study in patients with a history of IUGR during a previous pregnancy shows that taking EPA 3 grams daily, starting at 12-14 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery, does not seem to reduce the risk of IUGR when compared with placebo (1027).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for lung cancer treatment.\nIn patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, taking an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) 2 grams daily while undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin does not improve tumor response rate, survival, or physical functioning over a 12 month period when compared with taking an isocaloric control nutritional supplement (91413).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral EPA reduces hot flashes after menopause.\nIn post-menopausal adults with mild hot flash symptoms, clinical research shows that taking ethyl-EPA (ethyl-EPA) 500 mg three times daily, provides modest reduction in the frequency of hot flashes when compared with placebo. After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean number of hot flashes decreased by 1.58 per day in those taking ethyl-EPA. However, taking ethyl-EPA did not significantly decrease the severity of hot flashes or improve overall quality of life (16901). Research in patients with more severe hot flash symptoms is needed to confirm these results.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for increasing muscle strength.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing EPA 330 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 660 mg, for 3 years does not increase muscle strength in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nPhysical performance. Taking EPA does not seem to improve physical performance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for increasing physical performance in older adults.\nClinical research in mechanically ventilated patients shows that taking EPA 2 grams daily for 10 days, alone or with beta-hydroxymethylbutyrate 3 grams daily, does not increase diaphragm or quadriceps strength or thickness when compared with placebo (109223). Also, a large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing EPA 330 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 660 mg, for 3 years does not improve physical performance in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nPostoperative infection. Oral EPA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that enteral nutrition supplemented with EPA in combination with RNA and L-arginine, given during the postoperative period, reduces the percentage of patients experiencing postoperative infectious/wound complications and shortens the duration of hospitalization by about 4 days when compared to standard enteral nutrition (5531). It is not clear if this effect is due to EPA, RNA, L-arginine, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral EPA helps to maintain postoperative lean body mass.\nWeight loss and malnutrition are common after esophageal cancer resection. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering EPA-enhanced enteral nutrition does not attenuate loss of body weight or lean body mass by one month post-esophagectomy when compared with standard enteral nutrition (96504).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral EPA during pregnancy reduces the risk of hypertension.\nA small study in patients with a history of intrauterine growth restriction during a previous pregnancy shows that taking EPA 3 grams daily, starting at 12-14 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery, does not seem to reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension when compared with placebo (1027).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for prostate cancer treatment or prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking EPA 4.48 grams and docosahexaenoic acid 2.88 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with normal PSA levels at baseline. However, it is unclear if this effect was due to EPA alone. Additionally, it is unclear if this leads to a reduced risk for prostate cancer (89423). Observational research regarding the association between EPA and prostate cancer risk is conflicting. Although some early research suggests a possible association, a meta-analysis including this and other prospective observational research shows that increased dietary intake or serum levels of EPA are not associated with overall prostate cancer risk (90677, 102503). One observational study in men with existing low-risk prostate cancer shows that the highest tertile of prostate tissue levels of EPA, as well as the highest tertile of dietary intake, is associated with 71% to 75% reduced odds for progression to high-grade prostate cancer when compared with the lowest tertile (102502). However, other prospective observational research suggests that increased dietary intake of EPA may be associated with an increased risk for fatal prostate cancer (102503). High-quality prospective research is needed to clarify these findings.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial in psoriasis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking ethyl-EPA 1.8 grams daily in combination with low-dose (20 mg per day) etretinate (Tegison, no longer available in the US) for 12 weeks is more effective than etretinate alone for plaque psoriasis (66478).\nless\nQuality of life. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for improving quality of life in patients with cancer.\nA meta-analysis of eight clinical trials in cancer patients shows that taking EPA, usually alone in doses of 2-2.2 grams daily for 6-12 weeks, does not seem to improve quality of life when compared with placebo (106070). This analysis included two studies in which EPA was combined with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish oil.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Evidence for the use of oral EPA in schizophrenia is conflicting.\nSome clinical research shows that EPA improves mental state and reduces dyskinesia when taken along with antipsychotic medications (8720). However, other clinical research shows that EPA does not improve mental state, cognitive function, or mood in patients with schizophrenia who are taking antipsychotics (10347). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that EPA modestly improves the mental state of patients with schizophrenia who are not taking antipsychotic medications prior to treatment, but not those already being treating with antipsychotics at baseline. Some evidence suggests that ethyl-EPA might be more effective than EPA. Taking EPA does not appear to significantly decrease the need for conventional antipsychotics (15039). EPA or ethyl-EPA 1-3 grams daily in divided doses for 12-16 weeks has been used in these studies (8720, 15039).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for SLE, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for SLE nephritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral EPA is beneficial for ulcerative colitis prevention and treatment.\nPopulation research derived from the Nurses' Health Study shows that a higher dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a reduced incidence of ulcerative colitis. One study shows that taking EPA 1 gram twice daily for 6 months reduces fecal calprotectin levels, a marker of intestinal mucosal inflammation, by 40% when compared with placebo. Additionally, a 27% reduction in disease relapse was seen in the EPA group (96503).\nless\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using oral EPA for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of EPA for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate eicosapentaenoic acid for these uses.",

One prescription ethyl-EPA product (Vascepa, formerly AMR101, Amarin) is standardized to contain at least 96% pure EPA and no docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (91409, 91410). In some research, EPA has been concentrated from fish oil such as anchovy (90710). In other research, oils from algae such as Nannochloropsis have been used as a source of EPA (103314).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEPA is a long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is found in the tissues of marine mammals and oily fish. EPA is also found in fish liver oils, commercial fish oil products, and some commercial oil products from algae such as Nannochloropsis (8696, 103314). Over the past 100 years, there has been a decrease in intake of omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA. This is particularly true for Western-based diets, which are characterized by lower intake of fish and marine foods (7148, 47953, 47954, 47971). Another indirect source of EPA is oil from certain plants belonging to the primrose and borage families. These oils contain stearidonic acid (SDA), which is metabolized to EPA in animals and humans (91415, 91416). However, it is not clear if EPA produced via the metabolism of stearidonic acid has the same effects as other sources of EPA.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEPA competes with arachidonic acid for inclusion in cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways (8696). This may have an anti-inflammatory effect in diseases such as psoriasis (1004). In human research, EPA has been shown to reduce markers of inflammation such as inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) (91409, 91411, 91413, 102389). Also, EPA has been shown to increase levels of the anti-inflammatory metabolites 18-hydroxy-EPA (18-HEPE), 7,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EpETE), and resolvin E1 (110365).\nAntiplatelet effects\nEPA has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation by 12% after 4 weeks of oral administration. The antiplatelet effect might be more pronounced in males than females (90697). Preliminary clinical research shows that EPA suppresses maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) induced by collagen, but not platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate or arachidonic acid. In patients taking clopidogrel and aspirin after PCI with elevated P2Y12 reactions units (PRU) demonstrating high on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR), taking EPA significantly reduces P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). The clinical effect of EPA on reducing clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness based on PRU levels requires further research (96497).\nBlood coagulation effects\nEPA decreases blood viscosity and increases red blood cell deformability. It also decreases platelet aggregation (9930). However, EPA does not significantly affect clotting factors, fibrinogen concentrations, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or tissue plasminogen activator activity (10323).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that EPA reduces the risk of myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary intervention (91412). Some preliminary research suggests that EPA may be incorporated into atherosclerotic plaques, which may improve plaque stability and help reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction following PCI (94141). One small clinical study in adults with non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaques shows that taking EPA 1800 mg daily with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily stabilizes new atherosclerotic plaques after one year better than therapy with rosuvastatin 2.5 mg daily (102504). However, conflicting research suggests that EPA does not necessarily improve plaque stability, but it appears to improve microvascular function and plaque lipid volume (91412, 96419). There is also preliminary clinical evidence showing that administering EPA immediately following percutaneous coronary intervention reduces the incidence of adverse cardiac events including death (96420). This effect is attributed to anti-inflammatory and corresponding anti-arrhythmic activities of EPA (91411).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nSome preliminary research shows that EPA, in combination with RNA and L-arginine, helps reduce the risk of infection after upper gastrointestinal surgery (5531). It's possible that this combination helps reduce infection risk by preventing postoperative immunosuppression. Preliminary clinical research shows that enteral nutrition supplemented with EPA, RNA, and L-arginine, given for 1-5 days following surgery for upper gastrointestinal malignancies, increases the number of helper T cells (CD4) and activated T cells, as well as mean immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentrations and B-lymphocyte indices after surgery (5533). Also, this combination appears to reduce concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 and accelerate the recovery of concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-2 receptor after surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer (5532). In addition, when given preoperatively, this combination appears to increase the expression of HLA-DR epitopes on monocytes; low monocyte HLA-DR expression indicates immunodepression (7819).\n\nHowever, some preliminary research suggests that EPA may have immunosuppressant effects. There is preliminary evidence that EPA decreases natural killer (NK) cell activity. Researchers think this effect might be beneficial in preventing rejection after bone marrow and organ transplantation, but further research is needed (8718).\nLipid effects\nPure EPA reduces serum triglyceride concentrations, but has no effect on total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in mildly hypercholesterolemic men (6143, 10322). There is some evidence that higher ratios of EPA to arachidonic acid are associated with lower ratios of total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. EPA can increase HDL cholesterol by approximately 12% (10321). In normolipidemic individuals, an algal oil enriched in EPA reduced levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and total cholesterol but had no effect on triglyceride or LDL cholesterol levels (103314).\nLipolytic effects\nSome evidence suggests that supplemental EPA might slow weight loss in cachectic cancer patients, possibly by inhibiting lipolysis. Other research suggests EPA does not inhibit lipolysis or lipid oxidation, suggesting a different mechanism might be responsible for this effect (8717).\nNeurological effects\nThere is evidence EPA might have an additive effect to standard treatment on symptoms associated with schizophrenia and recurrent unipolar depressive disorder, but it is unknown if EPA has any antipsychotic and antidepressant activity of its own (8720, 10872). Preliminary clinical research suggests that EPA might enhance the responsiveness of serotonin receptors in patients with schizophrenia (13762). In patients with depression, EPA upregulates the expression of phospholipase (PL) A2. This might play a role in the antidepressant effects of EPA (99137). Some preliminary evidence in laboratory research suggests that while EPA uptake into the brain is low with supplementation, it is possible that EPA may prevent cell death and atrophy in the brain (66129)."

Due to cyanogenic glycosides, these may cause nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, weakness, dizziness, numbness, and stupor. Cooking eliminates the toxin.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, nausea and vomiting have been reported after consuming a specific elderberry and echinacea product (Echinaforce Hot Drink, A. Vogel Bioforce AG) (95650). However, it is unclear if this was due to the elderberry or Echinacea contained in the product.\n\nRaw and unripe elderberries, and the seeds, leaves, and other elder tree parts might cause nausea, vomiting, or severe diarrhea due to cyanogenic glycosides (17020, 17021). Cooking eliminates the toxin.\nless\nHepatic\nIn one case report, a 60-year-old female with underlying autoimmune disease presented with autoimmune hepatitis after taking elderberry at an unknown dose for several years.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nInfluenza. Although some small clinical studies show that elderberry extracts can improve influenza symptoms in otherwise healthy adults, a small clinical study enrolling adults and children with or without high risk medical conditions shows it does not reduce the duration of symptoms.\nSmall clinical studies in otherwise healthy adults with influenza presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset show that taking elderberry extract syrup (Sambucol, Nature's Way) 15 mL four times daily for 5 days improves patient ratings of symptoms such as aches and pains, cough, and nasal congestion an average of 4 days earlier than in control groups. It also reduced the use of rescue medications (5260, 12235). Another small clinical study in adults shows that taking an elderberry extract lozenge (ViraBLOC, HerbalScience) 175 mg four times daily for 2 days, starting within 24 hours of symptom onset, improves flu-like symptoms, typically within 48 hours, when compared with placebo (17022). However, in a small clinical study in children and adults 5 years and older with influenza, including those with high-risk conditions such as asthma, chronic lung disease, and heart disease, using Sambucol for 5 days starting within 48 hours of symptom onset did not reduce the time to complete resolution of symptoms for a 24-hour period when compared with placebo (103831). These negative findings may be due to the age and baseline health status of the enrolled patients, as well as the use of symptom resolution, as opposed to symptom improvement, as the primary outcome.\n\nElderberry has also been evaluated in combination with echinacea for treating influenza symptoms (95650), but it is not clear whether the combination is better than either ingredient alone.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there is interest in using oral elderberry for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of elderberry for this purpose.\nAsthenopia (eye strain). Oral elderberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults without dry eye disease with occupations requiring the use of video display terminals shows that taking a specific combination product containing elderberry fruit extract 300 mg, zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine 50 mg, currant 100 mg, and Eleutherococcus root 50 mg (Meramirt CM) once daily for 1 month improves measures of eye strain and contrast sensitivity when compared to baseline. Improvements in these measures were lacking in the control group (111295). Statistical comparison between the two groups was not reported. It is unclear if these effects are due to elderberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear whether elderberry has any benefit in CVD. In one small study it did not alter disease markers.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal women shows that taking elderberry extract 500 mg daily for 12 weeks does not significantly improve markers of CVD, including inflammatory biomarkers, vascular activity, or plasma lipid or glucose levels, when compared with placebo (21141).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral elderberry for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of elderberry for this purpose.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Elderberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in men aged 40-70 years with a history of smoking and Stage 2 COPD, shows that a combination of elderberry 165 mg, heart's ease herb 165 mg, and calendula flowers 165 mg (Inflaminat, INAT-Farma), 3 capsules daily for 6 months modestly improves the score on the 5-point breathlessness, cough, and sputum scale (BCSS) and modestly increases the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with no changes in the placebo group. However, the number of COPD exacerbations per month is not affected (103629). It is unclear if these effects are due to elderberry, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCognitive function. Oral elderberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming a multi-ingredient beverage containing elderberry extract 50 mg, carob extract, green tea powder, and guarana seed extract improves some measures of cognitive function such as rapid visual information processing and multitasking 120 minutes later when compared with placebo (113940). It is unclear if this effect is due to elderberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCommon cold. Oral elderberry extract does not seem to PREVENT colds when taken prophylactically, but it may reduce the duration and severity of existing colds.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking capsules containing elderberry extract (BerryPharma, Iprona AG) 600 mg daily for 8 days before overseas air travel, and then 900 mg daily starting 1 day before traveling and continuing for 4-5 days after arriving at the destination, does not reduce the number of colds or impact quality of life when compared with placebo. However, this product does reduce the duration of colds by about 2 days and the severity of colds by about 58% when compared with placebo (91374).\nless\nConstipation. Oral elderberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial among airline flight crew shows that taking a specific product (ACTIVE) containing elderberry extract 70 mg and a specific probiotic formulation (SYNBIO) daily for 1 month improves constipation, stool volume and consistency, ease of defecation, intestinal regularity, flatulence, and diarrhea compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (112134). It is unclear if these effects are due to elderberry, the probiotics, or the combination.\nless\nGingivitis. Elderberry has been evaluated as a mouthwash or patch in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a mouth rinse (HM-302, Izun Pharmaceuticals) containing elderberry, echinacea, and gotu kola 15 mL three times daily for 14 days might prevent worsening of gingivitis when compared with a placebo rinse. However, it only minimally improves symptoms (20069). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying a periodontal patch (PerioPatch, Izun Pharmaceuticals) containing elderberry, echinacea, and gotu kola either as a single dose, or three times daily for 1 day then once daily for 2 days, reduces some, but not all, measures of inflammation and gingivitis when compared with no treatment (20068, 20070).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral elderberry for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of elderberry for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if elderberry is beneficial for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.\nOne preliminary clinical study in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking capsules containing spray-dried elderberry 400 mg, providing 10% anthocyanins, three times daily for 2 weeks does not reduce serum lipids when compared with placebo (21142).\nless\nLower respiratory tract infections. Oral elderberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 2-6 years with recurrent respiratory tract infections shows that adding a specific combination product (Stimunex gocce) containing elderberry extract, beta-glucans, zinc, and vitamin D3 to standard therapy does not reduce the number or duration of lower respiratory tract infections when compared with standard therapy alone. In the four months after treatment completion, the number of infections was reduced by about 50%; however, the total number of infections in each group was small. The dose was 1 drop/kg daily for one month, followed by 1 drop/kg daily for 15 consecutive days each month for the next three months (109212). The validity of this study is limited by lack of blinding.\nless\nObesity. Elderberry has been studied for weight loss in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research in overweight adults shows that replacing all meals for 8 days with a kit containing elderberry juice (from 120 grams of elderberries/day), dried elderberry (225 mg/day), dried elderflower (3.9 grams/day), elderflower extract (600 mg/day), and dried asparagus (40.5 grams/day), while also taking psyllium 2-3 teaspoons daily for 2 weeks, is associated with a mean decrease in body weight of 3.2 kg over 14 days when compared with baseline (94939). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear whether this effect is due to elderberry, other ingredients, the combination, or fasting from regular food.\nless\nPsychological well-being. Oral elderberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial among airline flight crew shows that taking a specific product (ACTIVE) containing elderberry extract 70 mg and a specific probiotic formulation (SYNBIO) daily for 1 month improves scores on the Psychological General Well Being Index when compared with placebo. The index measures symptoms of anxiety and depression, general health status, and feelings of vitality and general self-control (112134). It is unclear if these effects are due to elderberry, the probiotics, or the combination.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Oral elderberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 2-6 years with recurrent respiratory tract infections shows that adding a specific combination product (Stimunex gocce) containing elderberry extract, beta-glucans, zinc, and vitamin D3 to standard therapy reduces the duration of respiratory tract infections by about 1.7 days and modestly improves parent-perceived symptom severity when compared with standard therapy alone. However, there was no effect on the number of total, upper, or lower respiratory tract infections, the use of antibiotics or antipyretics, or the number of days missed from school. The product was dosed as 1 drop/kg daily for one month, followed by 1 drop/kg daily for 15 consecutive days each month for the next three months (109212).

Elderberry might have immunostimulant effects, increasing the production of cytokines, including interleukin and tumor necrosis factor (10796, 12235, 110123).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with elderberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe anthocyanidins in elderberry are detected in the plasma 30 minutes after ingestion (11097). Peak concentrations occur after 3-4 hours (21142).\nExcretion\nThe anthocyanidins in elderberry are excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sambubioside conjugates (11096, 91376, 91377). The half-life of elderberry anthocyanidins is estimated to be between 2 and 6 hours (11098, 21142, 91376, 91378).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of elderberry is the ripe fruit. Elderberries contain several flavonoids including the anthocyanidins cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, and pelargonidin glucosides (11096, 91373, 91374, 113938, 115653). They also contain phenolic acids including caffeic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, gallic, and syringic acids (103823, 113938). Elderberries also contain flavonols such as quercetin, rutin, isoquercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin, as well as hyperoside, phytosterols, carotenoids, iron, copper, zinc, vitamins such as vitamin C, and minerals, such as magnesium (91373, 91374, 95081, 103823, 113938). Elderberry also contains 3% tannins and essential oil, as well as fatty acids. The major protein of elder is a lectin called Sambucus nigra agglutinin IVf (4151, 95081).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nElderberry anthocyanidins are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects (12235). However, elderberry also seems to increase production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (10796). In a rodent model, elderberry extract exhibits dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects as demonstrated by reduced granuloma formation around an implanted cotton pellet (113938).\nAntinociceptive effects\nThere is interest in using elderberry for analgesic purposes. In a rodent model, elderberry extract exhibits a dose-dependent analgesic effect as demonstrated in an acetic-acid induced writhing test. (113938).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe polyphenols in elderberry may be responsible for its antioxidant effects (91374, 115655).\nAntiviral effects\nElderberry extract inhibits replication of several strains of influenza viruses A and B (5260). In vitro, elderberry fruit extract also inhibits H1N1 \"swine\" flu. Elderberry flavonoids are thought to bind to H1N1 virions and prevent the virus from entering host cells (17023).\nImmunological effects\nElderberry extract and elderberry anthocyanidins are thought to have immunomodulating effects (5260, 12235).\nLiver enzyme effects\nLaboratory research shows that elderberry does not affect CYP3A4 activity (88162).\nMetabolic effects\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that drinking 100% elderberry juice containing 360 mg anthocyanins, divided into 2 doses with morning and evening meals daily for 1 week, increases average carbohydrate oxidation and decreases average fat oxidation in a high-sugar meal tolerance test, when compared with placebo. The average respiratory quotient (carbon dioxide produced divided by oxygen consumed) is also higher with elderberry juice (112948).\nTestosterone effects\nIn an animal model of testosterone deficiency, elderberry extract increases total testosterone and free testosterone, improves sperm motility, and enhances markers of Leydig cell function, possibly due to increased expression of testosterone-synthesizing enzymes and decreased expression of testosterone-degrading enzymes (116244).\nThyroid effects\nIn adults with overweight and obesity elderberry juice consumption for one week increases serum thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) when compared with placebo (116243). Conversely, animal research suggests that consuming elderberry juice for a longer duration of 13 weeks does not impact T4 levels (116243).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using elderberry for weight loss. A very small study in overweight adults shows that drinking elderberry juice 177.5 grams orally twice daily for 1 week improves serum glucose levels, increases fat oxidation, and favorably modulates gut microbiota (115653)."

The main active constituents of elecampane are the sesquiterpene alkaloids, alantolactone and isoalantolactone (11). Several phenolic compounds are also found in elecampane roots. These include chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and rosmarinic acid (109608). Other constituents of elecampane include isocostunolide, sesquiterpene lactones, and thymol derivatives (48707, 48709, 48715, 48719, 48720, 48733).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using elecampane or its constituents for reducing inflammation in conditions such as acne, acute lung injury, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. In vitro research shows that an extract prepared from elecampane inhibited lipopolysaccharide-mediated production of nitric oxide, as well as the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, in a dose-dependent manner (105733). In vitro research shows that isoalantolactone and alantolactone, constituents of elecampane root, reduce markers of inflammation such as nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and others (99489, 109600). Research in mice shows that intraperitoneal injection of isoalantolactone reduces the severity and inflammation of experimentally-induced acute lung injury (99489). Research in mice also shows that topical application of a cream containing alantolactone or mixed sesquiterpene lactones from elecampane reduces symptoms, swelling, and inflammatory markers of experimentally-induced dermatitis or psoriasis (99490, 109600).\nAntimicrobial activity\nAlantolactone and isoalantolactone, sesquiterpene alkaloids found in elecampane, demonstrate antibacterial and antifungal activity in vitro, and anthelmintic activity in humans (11). Alantolactone is used as an anthelmintic in Europe and the UK (11).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that a methanol-water extract of elecampane root has good antioxidant activity (109608).\nAntispasmodic activity\nIn an animal model, the volatile oil of elecampane root had relaxant effects on tracheal and ileal smooth muscles (31503).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro research shows that an extract prepared from elecampane inhibits sebum production (105733)."

Oral eleuthero root extract might help to prevent and reduce the severity of genital herpes outbreaks.\nOne clinical study in patients with recurrent genital herpes infections shows that taking a specific eleuthero root extract (Elagen) 400 mg, standardized to contain eleutheroside 0.3%, daily for at least 3 months reduces the frequency, severity, and duration of outbreaks when compared with placebo (730).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral eleuthero root is not beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nOne study in trained distance runners shows that a specific eleuthero root liquid extract, standardized to eleutherosides B and E content, taken as 3.4 mL daily for 6 weeks, does not affect endurance, performance, or psychological, cardiac, or respiratory parameters when compared with placebo (7522). Small studies in trained athletes or healthy adults show that taking eleuthero 800-1200 mg daily (Endurox) for 1-6 weeks does not seem to have any effect on cycling performance time, respiration, lactate production, or heart rate recovery during cycling, stair-stepping exercise, treadmill, or cycle ergometry when compared with placebo (2335, 7600, 7601, 8994). However, there has been some speculation that a longer duration of supplementation is needed for benefit. One study in recreationally trained athletes shows that taking a specific powdered eleuthero root product 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks increased cycling endurance time by 23% and maximal oxygen consumption by 12% when compared with placebo.

It is not clear how this response rate compares to the use of lithium alone.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral eleuthero fruit is beneficial for preventing the development of CVD.\nOne small clinical study in healthy adults with at least two cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking an aqueous extract of eleuthero fruit 500 mg daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, when compared with placebo. It did not affect diastolic blood pressure, flow-mediated dilation, or carotid intima-media thickness. Also, taking a higher 1000 mg dose of the same eleuthero extract daily did not have significant effects on any measured parameters (105025).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral eleuthero root is beneficial for CFS.\nOne clinical study in adults with CFS shows that taking eleuthero root extract 2 grams daily for 2 months improves fatigue severity and duration when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (11099).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral eleuthero is beneficial for cognitive function.\nA very small clinical study in middle-aged people shows that taking eleuthero 325 mg twice daily might improve selective memory when compared with placebo (2574). Another very small study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of eleuthero leaf 203 mg and Drynaria fortunei 20 mg daily for 12 weeks improves figure recall, but not immediate memory or attention, when compared with placebo (102316). It is unclear if this effect is due to eleuthero, Drynaria fortunei, or the combination.\nless\nCommon cold. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome clinical research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product containing eleuthero plus andrographis (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) orally improves symptoms of the common cold when started within 72 hours of symptom onset. Some symptoms can improve after 2 days of treatment; however, it typically takes 4-5 days of treatment for maximal symptom relief (5784, 10795, 12380). Some research shows the combination of eleuthero and andrographis relieves cold symptoms better than echinacea or placebo in children (12381). It is unclear if this effect is due to eleuthero, andrographis, or the combination.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral eleuthero extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with a history of COVID-19 infection and current symptoms of long COVID-19 shows that taking a specific combination product containing eleuthero extract 78 mg, rhodiola extract 90 mg, and schisandra extract 300 mg (ADAPT-232/Chisan, Swedish Herbal Institute) twice daily for 2 weeks increases exercise capacity by about 13 minutes but does not reduce the duration of cough, fatigue, headache, pain, or other respiratory problems when compared with placebo (109635). It is unclear if these findings are due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral eleuthero is beneficial for improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.\nOne small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific eleuthero extract, standardized to contain eleutherosides E and B 1.12%, as 480 mg daily for 3 months, decreases fasting glucose by a mean of 36 mg/dL, postprandial blood glucose by a mean of 35 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by a mean of 0.8%, triglycerides by a mean of 106 mg/dL, and total cholesterol by a mean of 21 mg/dL when compared with placebo (91509).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy.

Contrast sensitivity scores also improved when compared to baseline in the treated group, but not in the control group (111295). It is unclear if these effects are due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nFamilial Mediterranean fever. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in children ages 3-15 years with familial Mediterranean fever shows that taking a specific combination product (ImmunoGuard, Inspired Nutritionals) containing eleuthero, andrographis, schisandra, and licorice for one month reduces the duration, frequency, and severity of disease recurrence when compared with placebo (12382). It is unclear if this effect is due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there is interest in using oral eleuthero for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of eleuthero for this condition.\nHangover. It is unclear if oral eleuthero root is beneficial for hangovers.\nOne small clinical study in healthy males shows that consuming one bottle of a powdered polysaccharide-rich extract of eleuthero root before and after consuming alcohol modestly reduces the severity of hangover as measured by the Acute Hangover Scale questionnaire score when compared with placebo (91508). However, the validity of these findings is brought into question due to the incomplete study information provided.\nless\nInfluenza. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with influenza shows that taking a specific combination product containing eleuthero 20-30 mg plus andrographis 178-266 mg (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) three times daily for 3-5 days relieves symptoms more quickly than amantadine. This combination product also reduced the risk of post-influenza complications, such as sinusitis or bronchitis, when compared with amantadine (10441). It is unclear if these effects are due to eleuthero, andrographis, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking two capsules each containing 400 mg of a combination of eleuthero, Panax pseudoginseng, and rehmannia daily for 6 weeks improves physical function in individuals with knee osteoarthritis when compared with placebo. However, the combination does not seem to reduce pain or stiffness when compared with placebo (74950). It is unclear if this effect is due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking low-dose calcium and vitamin D3 in combination with a 250 mg blend of rehmannia root and eleuthero stem bark extracts twice daily for 12 months attenuates the loss of spine and femur bone mineral density when compared with placebo or high-dose calcium and vitamin D (75036). It is unclear if this effect is due to eleuthero, rehmannia, or the combination.\nless\nPneumonia. Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with acute, nonspecific pneumonia shows that taking a specific combination product (ADAPT-232), containing eleuthero, rhodiola, and schisandra, as 20 mL twice daily for 10-15 days in conjunction with conventional treatment, reduces the duration of antibiotic treatment and improves quality of life when compared with conventional treatment alone (71152).\nless\nQuality of life. It is unclear if oral eleuthero root improves quality of life in older healthy adults.\nA small clinical study in elderly volunteers shows that taking eleuthero 300 mg daily improves social functioning and mental well-being after 4 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. However, this improvement was not maintained after 8 weeks of treatment (15586).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there is interest in using oral eleuthero for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of eleuthero for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if oral eleuthero root is beneficial for stress.\nOne clinical study in adults 30-50 years of age with symptoms of stress shows that taking a specific eleuthero root extract (WS 1070) 120 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve fatigue, exhaustion, cognitive alertness, or measures of stress when taken alone or in conjunction with stress management training (91510). However, another small clinical study in healthy females 20-68 years of age who have experienced stress for a prolonged period of time shows that taking 270 mg of a combination agent (ADAPT-232) containing eleuthero, rhodiola, and schisandra improves attention and cognitive speed and accuracy when compared with placebo (19289). It is unclear if these effects are due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Oral eleuthero has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with an uncomplicated URTI shows that taking 30 mL of a combination product (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) containing extracts of eleuthero root (eleutherosides B and E 0.03 mg/mL), echinacea root, and malabar nut leaf daily does not reduce the severity or frequency of cough by a clinically meaningful amount after 3-4 days of treatment when compared with bromhexine hydrochloride or placebo (95648). However, a non-blinded clinical study shows that taking 30 mL of this same product three times daily for 6 days improves the severity and frequency of coughing and the degree of nasal congestion when compared with bromhexine. Additionally, patients taking the combination product recovered two days sooner, on average, than those taking bromhexine (48569). The reason for these conflicting findings is unclear but may be due to an inadequate duration of treatment in the first study and/or lack of blinding in the second study. Also, it is unclear if any benefit is due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nOther research has evaluated a capsule formulation of Kan Jang (Swedish Herbal Institute), with each capsule containing eleuthero root 11.4 mg and andrographis 195 mg. One small clinical study in patients with an uncomplicated URTI shows that taking this product as two capsules three times daily for 5 days reduces the median number of sick leave days to 2 days, compared with 3 days in the placebo group. It also increases the total number of recovered patients on day 3 to 75%, compared with 55% of those taking placebo (107471).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate eleuthero for these uses.",

However, it is too soon to tell if this is clinically important. This interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, eleuthero might have antiplatelet effects.\nIn vitro and animal research show that eleuthero might inhibit platelet aggregation (7592, 74976). Concomitant use with herbs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding in some people. See other products with antiplatelet effects here. See products with anticoagulant activity here.\nless\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nTheoretically, eleuthero might alter blood glucose levels.\nSome research in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that eleuthero may lower blood glucose levels (91509). Animal research suggests that certain constituents of eleuthero have hypoglycemic activity in both healthy and diabetic animals (7591, 73535, 74932, 74956, 74988, 74990). However, one study in healthy individuals shows that eleuthero can increase postprandial blood glucose levels (12536). It is possible that taking eleuthero with other products that lower blood glucose levels could increase the risk for hypoglycemia. See other products with hypoglycemic potential here.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS\nThere is concern that eleuthero can worsen certain cardiovascular conditions. Eleuthero has been reported to cause tachycardia, hypertension, headache, and pericardial pain in patients with rheumatic heart disease or atherosclerosis. It is unclear if these effects were caused by eleuthero, or by the cardioglycoside-containing herb, silk vine (Periploca sepium), which is a common adulterant found in eleuthero products (12, 797, 6500).\nless\nHORMONE SENSITIVE CANCERS/CONDITIONS\nThere is concern that eleuthero can worsen hormone sensitive cancer or conditions. Because eleuthero might have estrogenic effects (6180), women with hormone sensitive conditions should avoid eleuthero. Some of these conditions include breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "DIGOXIN SERUM ASSAY\nEleuthero can interfere with some serum digoxin measurements. It falsely elevates serum digoxin concentrations when fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) or the Abbott Digoxin III assay are used, and falsely lowers digoxin concentrations when microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) is used (15585, 16417, 22638). This interference is likely related to the structural similarity of some eleutherosides to cardiac glycosides (15585). Interference does not occur when digoxin levels are measured with an enzyme multiplied immunoassay (EMIT), the Randox digoxin assay, a chemiluminescent assay (CLIA), or the Roche Tina-Quant turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (15585, 16417).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with eleuthero.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal research, injection of eleuthero resulted in detection of the constituent eleutherosides B and E in blood, by 88.8% and 91.2%, respectively (74917).\nDistribution\nIn animal research, eleutherosides B and E, constituents of eleuthero, were found in the liver, kidney, spleen, and heart after intravenous administration (74917).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the eleuthero plant is the root, and sometimes the fruit. Although it contains a large number of identified constituents, isofraxidin, syringin, and eleutherosides are considered to be the most bioactive components (74930, 74964, 75007, 75023, 75049, 75051, 75052, 105025).\nAdaptogenic effects\nEleuthero is often classified as an adaptogen. Adaptogens are believed to increase resistance to emotional, chemical, and physical trauma, as well as anxiety, weakness, mental exhaustion, and fatigue. Adaptogens have been shown to improve mental and physical performance and reduce harmful effects of stress (75055). Researchers have proposed that the mechanism may involve the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, causing decreases or normalizing of nitric oxide (NO) and cortisol (75011, 75056). Modulation of the HPA axis may also adjust imbalances related to immunity, hormones, and stress (75012). Most adaptogens also have anxiolytic and antioxidant properties (71277). According to a review, adaptogen-induced upregulation of Hsp70 triggers stress-induced c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK1) and stress-activated Forkhead Box O transcription factor DAF-16-mediated pathways (74945); according to the researchers, this may regulate the resistance to stress and result in enhanced mental and physical performance.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro and in vivo, eleuthero has demonstrated the ability to suppress reactive oxygen species production by mouse peritoneal macrophages (74936). In cultured murine macrophages, eleuthero attenuated LPS-induced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression through the inhibition of Akt and JNK pathways and inhibited inducible NOS synthase through inhibition of intracellular peroxide production (74922, 74925). In vitro, eleuthero inhibited cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzymes (74926).\nAnti-ulcer effects\nIn animal research, an extract of eleuthero stem bark exhibited ulcer-preventing effects (50830). The authors suggested that the protective effects may be due to the chlorogenic acid and syringaresinol di-O-beta-D-glucoside constituents.\nAntiarthritic effects\nIn vitro, a combination of Panax notoginseng, Rehmannia glutinosa, and eleuthero significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, nitric oxide, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner. This combination also killed activated T cells selectively, conserving naïve T cells. In a DBA/1 collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, this combination suppressed the progression of CIA and decreased synovial hyperplasia, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion (74914). It is unclear if these effects are due to eleuthero, other ingredients, or the combination.\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal research, extracts of eleuthero reduced plasma glucose (6206, 7528, 73535, 7591, 74988, 74990). Some human research shows that eleuthero extract decreases fasting plasma glucose. This is thought to be due to the eleutheroside constituents increasing the kinetics of insulin on its receptor. Furthermore, eleutherosides E and B induce an insulin-independent transfer of glucose into the cell. Eleutherosides may selectively neutralize the beta-lipoprotein-induced block of transfer of glucose through cellular membranes (91509). However, in other human research, eleuthero increased postprandial plasma glucose (12536).\n\nIn a diabetes mellitus type 2 model in mice, administering eleuthero orally for three days reduced the postprandial plasma glucose level without affecting plasma insulin levels (74956). In these mice, eleuthero significantly inhibited alpha-glucosidase activity in the small intestinal mucosa. In normal rats, syringin, a constituent of eleuthero, raised the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals, which in turn stimulated muscarinic M3 receptors in pancreatic cells, augmenting insulin release and resulting in reduced plasma glucose (74934). In type 1 diabetic rats, injection of syringin dose-dependently decreased plasma glucose (74932). In a rat model, syringin significantly attenuated the increase in plasma glucose caused by an intravenous glucose challenge and also stimulated glucose uptake in the soleus muscle (74933).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn animal research, eleuthero or its constituents have shown antitumor effects (7530, 74900, 74984, 74968). Cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of eleuthero have been shown in various in vitro studies (7525, 74898, 74999). Eleuthero extract has demonstrated antineoplastic activity against leukemia, hepatoma, and prostate cancer cells (7525, 46968, 74952, 74959, 75021, 75029, 75057).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, eleuthero extract exhibited the ability to entrap lipid peroxide radicals (74904) and demonstrated strong activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and other types of free radicals (74898, 75029). In vitro, eleuthero fruit extracts showed radical-scavenging activity comparable to alpha-tocopherol (75021). In vitro, eleuthero inhibited lipid peroxidation (74926) and xanthine oxidase (75021).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, a liquid extract of eleuthero inhibited the productive replication of the RNA viruses, human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A virus (7526). However, it seems to have no effect on DNA viruses such as adenovirus or herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) (7526).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn adults with heart disease, ventricular potential was improved after taking eleuthero extract (7523). In rats, eleuthero extract prevented stress-induced heart damage by increasing cardiac tolerance to the cardiotoxic action of D,L-isoproterenol and the arrhythmogenic action of epinephrine (74935). The cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic effects were related to an increase in endogenous opioid peptide levels.\n\nIn vitro, the vasorelaxant effect of eleuthero may be mediated by nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, inhibition of potassium channels, or activation of muscarinic receptors (74906). In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, Acanthopanax senticoside B (a monomer of eleuthero saponins) protected cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress-induced injury through reduction of lipid peroxidation and enhancement of the activity of antioxidant defense (74949).\nEndocrine effects\nAnecdotal evidence suggests hormonal changes with use of eleuthero; however, preliminary research suggests a lack of androgenicity (850). In vitro, eleuthero binds to classical steroid receptors (74987). In animal research, eleuthero increases plasma corticosterone (74979) and has a slight, but significant, inhibitory effect on estrone-3-sulfate uptake (35450). According to animal research, the adaptogenic effects of eleuthero may be due to alteration of activity of the pituitary-adrenocortical system (74969, 74979). In animal research, eleuthero had no effect on prolactin levels (74916). In mice, an eleuthero extract improved hair growth by increasing testosterone levels and restoring the number and activity of hair follicles (75030).\nExercise performance effects\nThe physical endurance effects of eleuthero have been reviewed in several studies (10390, 74890, 74913, 74919). However, in most clinical studies, eleuthero has not affected athletic performance (2335, 7522, 7600, 7601, 8994).\n\nIn animal research, water extracts of eleuthero increased swimming time and inhibited the reduction of natural killer cell activity and the elevation of corticosterone associated with exercise (74909). In mice, eleutherosides from eleuthero were shown to improve physical and mental fatigue (74958). In rats, eleuthero increased the time to exhaustion by treadmill running, and it suppressed the exercise-induced increase of 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis and tryptophan hydroxylase expression in the dorsal raphe (74927). In mice, extracts of eleuthero stem bark extended the swimming time to exhaustion, increased tissue glycogen, and decreased blood lactate and serum urea nitrogen (74961).\nHematologic effects\nIn animal research, eleuthero has been shown to exhibit anticoagulant effects (74976). In human research, exercise-induced increase of blood coagulation was reversed using eleuthero (75005). In animal research, injection with eleuthero altered the circadian rhythm of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and leukocytes (74944). Eleuthero extract also increased hyperplasia of erythropoietic stem cells, perhaps decreasing over time, without effect on granulocytopoiesis (74905, 74895, 74894).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn animal research, injection of water-soluble polysaccharides from eleuthero lowered serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase, improved histologic changes in the liver, and inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis (74907). In mice that drank a solution containing cadmium, eleuthero extract caused a significant decrease of cadmium concentration in the blood and liver and decreased the cadmium-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells (74947).\nImmunologic effects\nEleuthero extract has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects, including increasing cellular and humoral activity, the activation and proliferation of immunocompetent cells, and stimulation and inhibition of cytokine synthesis, in human, animal, and in vitro research (7530, 31205, 74884, 74887, 74897, 74902, 74967, 74970, 74975, 74989)(74992, 74995, 74997, 75015, 75016, 75017). According to a review, immunomodulating polysaccharides or saponins isolated from eleuthero stimulated macrophages, promoted antibody formation, activated complement, and increased T lymphocyte proliferation (32852). In rabbits, eleuthero extract had a lasting immunostimulative effect and enhanced phagocytic activity (75018). In vitro, syringin, a constituent of eleuthero root, stimulated rat blood macrophages to perform phagocytosis (75019). In animal research, eleuthero inhibited the induction of systemic allergy by 25% and passive cutaneous allergic reaction by 50% (74886). Histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, as well as secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, were also inhibited. Similar results were seen in other animal studies (74892, 74901).\nNeurologic effects\nEleuthero has been used traditionally to improve cognitive function (71151). According to a review, eleuthero protects neurons and inhibits brain cell apoptosis (75009). In animal research, a water extract of eleuthero inhibited inflammation and microglial activation in brain ischemia (74912). In cultured rat cortical neurons, extracts of eleuthero were shown to have protective effects on the regeneration of neurites and the reconstruction of synapses in rat cultured cortical neurons damaged by amyloid-beta (74940).\n\nIn rats subjected to heat environmental stress (HES), oral eleuthero extract prevented a stress-induced increase in fatty acid synthase activity, oxidoreductase activity, and lipid peroxidation (74955). There was also a decrease in the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. In mice, eleutheroside E from eleuthero prevented sleep deprivation-induced behavioral impairment, including reduced latency entering into a dark chamber and locomotion, and increased monoamines in the hippocampus (74963).\nRadioprotective effects\nIn mice, a combination therapy composed of Cistanche, eleuthero, and Zizyphus protected against gamma irradiation by increasing peripheral white blood cell counts, the level of bone marrow karyocytes, and serum superoxide dismutase levels (75022). In vitro, eleuthero extract was slightly radioprotective for gamma irradiation (74998)."

However, taking this combination was only associated with higher recurrence-free rates at 6 months, not at 12 months. All subjects included in this study were unable to receive standard recurrence prevention therapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (106054).\nCognitive function. A preliminary clinical study shows that taking ellagic acid 50 mg once daily for 12 weeks improves cognitive function and IQ compared to placebo in overweight, middle-aged patients. Taking ellagic acid does not improve these measurements in patients with normal weight (96298).\nDiabetes. A small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking ellagic acid 180 mg daily for 8 weeks has beneficial effects on glycemic status, insulin resistance, and lipid levels when compared with placebo. Fasting blood glucose was reduced by 37 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 1.3%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15%, with no change in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (106319, 106321).

Active treatment also reduces the risk of progression of L-SIL to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL) by 12.5% when compared with placebo (96297).\nMelasma. Preliminary clinical research in females with epidermal and mixed melasma shows that applying a gel containing ellagic acid 1% twice daily to the face in the morning before sunscreen and at night for 6 months decreases pigmentation similarly to arbutin 1% (96294). Other preliminary clinical research in females with melasma shows that applying a topical product containing ellagic acid 0.5% and salicylic acid 0.1% to the entire face twice daily for 12 weeks decreases the size and number of dark spots similarly to hydroquinone 4%. Higher patient satisfaction was noted with the ellagic acid product; however, greater improvement in skin firmness was seen for patients treated with hydroquinone (96295).

Further research is needed to determine the long-term impact of ellagic acid.\nProstate cancer. A small preliminary clinical study in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer shows that adding ellagic acid 60 mg every 8 hours orally during and in between chemotherapy cycles with vinorelbine and estramustine for 6 weeks reduces neutropenia, possibly indicating better tolerance to chemotherapy. However, it does not improve clinical response, progression-free survival, overall survival, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in these patients (96296).\nMore evidence is needed to rate ellagic acid for these uses.",

Ellagic acid is present as ellagic tannin. Ellagic tannin is a glucose ester with hexahydrolxydiphenic acid. Ellagic tannins are hydrolyzed to release ellagic acid, which is then absorbed in the intestinal tract. However, in its free form, it is degraded by acid in the gut (96296).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEllagic acid is a polyphenolic compound (96297). The clinical usefulness of ellagic acid may be limited by its poor absorption and rapid elimination from the body (10340, 10342).\nAnti-malarial effects\nLaboratory research suggests ellagic acid may have potential use against malaria, due to its antiplasmodial activity (11460).\nAnticancer effects\nResearchers are interested in the potential anticancer activity of ellagic acid. Ellagic acid has lipophilic antioxidant activity, free radical scavenging capability, and the ability to inhibit DNA topoisomerases (8955, 10342, 11335). These characteristics support the observation that ellagic acid inhibits lipid peroxidation at lower concentrations than vitamin E (11335). Ellagic acid also seems to have anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic activity (11335).\n\nSome in vitro research shows that ellagic acid can selectively inhibit the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In mice, ellagic acid has also been shown to enhance the apoptotic effects of doxorubicin and cisplatin in HCC cells while also reducing the in vitro cytotoxic effects of these drugs on healthy liver cells and limiting doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. It is thought that ellagic acid improves the anticancer effects of these drugs via promotion of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. This process is needed for the activation of caspace-9, an important enzyme in apoptotic pathways (100933). Additionally, derivatives of ellagic acid have shown the ability to induce DNA damage and inhibit the growth of yeast cells that model the growth of cancer cells (10343). Some researchers have suggested that the hydroxyl groups and lactone rings in the chemical structure of ellagic acid may bind or inactivate carcinogens (10340). However, the clinical usefulness of ellagic acid may be limited by its poor absorption and rapid elimination from the body. Because the ability to inhibit carcinogenesis appears to be highly dependent upon its functional groups, alterations in the molecule to improve absorption or decrease the rate of elimination often decrease the activity of ellagic acid (10340, 10342).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn humans with type 2 diabetes, ellagic acid reduces oxidative stress, inhibits levels of inflammatory mediators, and beneficially alters levels of some proteins involved in inflammatory processes (106319).\nCognitive effects\nIndividuals who are middle aged and overweight have an increased risk for cognitive decline. Being overweight is also associated with an increased risk of dementia in old age. High cholesterol levels and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein may also be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Ellagic acid inhibits reactive oxygen species generation to protect against atherogenic signaling from oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Animal research suggests that ellagic acid has a neuroprotective effect on middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (96298).\nDermatologic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that ellagic acid may suppress melanogenesis through inhibition of tyrosinase activity via chelation of copper atoms on tyrosinase (96294).\nRenal effects\nIn a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy, ellagic acid appears to improve markers of kidney function, limit the worsening of renal pathology, reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, inhibit the upregulation of proteins implicated in nephropathy, and increase antioxidant enzyme activity. These effects are thought to be due to inhibition of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-kB pathway (100720)."

Fat from emus is macerated, centrifuged, heated, and filtered to obtain clear oil. This oil may be processed further, for example by bleaching, to attain cosmetic grade emu oil (94211, 94218). Emu oil has traditionally been used in Aboriginal medicine for various skin and musculoskeletal disorders due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects (10643, 94210, 94211, 94217).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEmu oil contains triglycerides, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, carotenoids, flavones, polyphenols, tocopherols, and phospholipids (8278, 94210, 94212, 94216, 94217). The polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio is 0.7, and the n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio is 13.7 (8278). Polyunsaturated fatty acids present include oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. Saturated fatty acids present include palmitic, myristic, and stearic acids (94210, 94212). However, the content of emu oil can vary depending on growing conditions, diet, and genetic factors of the emu (94211, 94217).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn rats with experimentally-induced arthritis, topically applied emu oil has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing paw swelling and arthritis scores (94211). Topical emu oil also reduces the swelling caused by application of croton oil to the ears of mice (5923). The anti-inflammatory effects are associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines in the tissues (94215). Polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids, which are present in emu oil, are known to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-1-beta, and to down-regulate eicosanoid pathways that produce thromboxane B2, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene B4 (94217, 94218). In rats, giving emu oil orally for 12 weeks is associated with a dose-related decrease in C-reactive protein levels (94219).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nPreliminary studies in rodents suggest that emu oil taken orally reduces serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Improvements in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are seen in some studies, but not in others (94218, 94219). A dose-related decrease in atheromatous plaque formation is also reported in obese rats treated with oral emu oil (94219).\nDermatologic effects\nTopical emu oil has moisturizing, cosmetic, and texture properties similar to those of topical mineral oil. It appears to penetrate the stratum corneum barrier of the skin (10643, 94213). Preliminary animal evidence suggests that a topical emu lotion (a combination of emu oil, vitamin E and botanical oil) has the ability to promote wound healing by exerting both anti-inflammatory and anti-catalytic effects on soft tissue (8277). When applied to second-degree burn wounds, emu oil appears to delay healing at the early, inflammatory stages. Later in the healing process, it promotes fibrinogenesis and synthesis of collagen to improve keratinization of the epidermis and increase the number of hair follicles in wound margins (94210). In neonates, application of emu oil to the heel 6 hours after birth improved the hydration of the stratum corneum and increased skin elasticity when compared with no treatment (110562).\nEffects on 5-fluorouracil toxicity\nPretreating rats with emu oil orally for 1 week before injection of a high dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) seems to reduce inflammation and bone loss induced by the drug. Emu oil inhibits expression of TNF-alpha, which has pro-inflammatory and osteoclastogenic effects (94216). Emu oil may also reduce gastrointestinal effects of 5-FU. Pretreatment with emu oil orally for 5 days before injection of high-dose 5-FU was associated with a reduction in inflammation and activated neutrophil activity in the ileum, and an improvement in ileal mucosal crypt depth (94220).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research shows that pretreating rats with oral emu oil for 5 days reduces the intestinal inflammation associated with experimentally-induced Crohn disease (94212). Additionally, in animal models of ulcerative colitis, oral emu oil reduced disease activity and colonic damage when compared with placebo (110563, 112299)."

In vitro, English horsemint inhibits the pro-inflammatory effects of macrophages, possibly by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide or cytokines (99141).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn a rat model of angina, a methanolic extract of English horsemint aerial parts prevents late, sustained reductions in cardiac contractility and attenuates ST-segment changes induced by angina, but has no effect on acute reductions in cardiac contractility or impairment of cardiac relaxation. The methanolic extract also decreases cardiac load in the angina setting through reductions in heart rate, increases in systolic duration, and further prolongation of diastolic duration (106558).\nContraceptive effects\nAnimal research shows that giving a methanol extract of English horsemint leaves, 50-100 mg/kg orally daily for 28 days decreases male fertility in a dose-dependent manner. The number of rat pups born after exposure of the male to English horsemint extract is decreased when compared with control. There is a decrease in sperm count and viability, and also decreases in numbers of stem cells and other sperm precursors. Epithelial cells in the seminiferous tubules degenerate, with larger interstitial spaces, and empty lumens without sperm precursors. Plasma levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and testosterone are reduced. Testicular levels of reactive oxygen species are increased, due to decreased levels of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase (111499)."

            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypercholesterolemia. Small clinical trials show that consuming English walnuts as part of a low-fat diet seems to lower cholesterol. Total cholesterol and lipoproteins are decreased when English walnuts are substituted for other fatty foods and constitute up to 20% of the calories in the diet. When English walnuts are added to a low fat diet, total cholesterol may be decreased by 4% to 12% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may be decreased by 8% to 16% (6431, 8476, 8477). Substituting English walnuts for other dietary fats as part of a diet containing 30% fat seems to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol-to-total cholesterol ratios in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there is no effect on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with a 30% fat diet without English walnuts (13300).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Epidemiological research has found that people who increase dietary consumption of nuts in general might have a lower risk of CHD and death due to coronary events. However, there is no available evidence showing that eating English walnut, specifically, reduces the risk of CHD (8478, 13299). In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 ounces of walnuts per day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD. The FDA has concluded that this claim is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (102335).\nDiabetes. Data from preliminary clinical research on the effects of English walnuts in people with type 2 diabetes are conflicting. Some clinical research shows that taking English walnut leaf extract 100 mg twice daily for 3 months decreases fasting blood glucose by about 13% when compared with placebo (97750). In contrast, other clinical research shows that taking English walnut leaf extract 100 mg once daily for one week and then twice daily for 7 weeks has no effect on fasting blood glucose levels (97749). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies involving a total of 195 patients, taking English walnut leaf extracts orally, 200-750 mg daily for 8 to 12 weeks, reduces fasting blood glucose by a mean of about 18 mg/dL and increases fasting insulin levels by a mean of about 2 units/L, but does not alter post-prandial glucose levels (113406). The majority of studies do not show a significant effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), but the meta-analysis shows a reduction when English walnut leaf extracts are taken for more than 8 weeks (97749, 97750, 113406).\nSubstituting English walnuts for other dietary fats as part of a diet containing 30% fat seems to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol-to-total cholesterol ratios in patients with type 2 diabetes.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nLevels of alpha-linolenic acid and omega-6 fatty acids increase in blood following consumption of walnuts (97747).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of English walnut are the fruit, hull, and leaf. English walnut fruit (the \"nut\") contains high amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). It also contains significant amounts of fiber (about 7%), phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, vitamins, folate, and protein, with amino acids arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, threonine, alanine, and glutamic acid. It also contains the antioxidants vitamin E (primarily as gamma-tocopherol), ellagic acid, and other polyphenols (8478, 8955, 97750, 113402, 113404). Phenolic compounds in English walnut leaves include flavonoids and naphthoquinones (97748). The leaves and husk contain ferulic acid, vanillic acid, coumaric acid, ellagic acid, myricetin, juglone, and plumbagin (12981, 97750). English walnut also contains pedunculagin, casuariin, strictinin, and tellimagrandin I (113404).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nIn rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis, ethanol and n-hexane extracts of English walnut leaves, 500 mg/kg given orally daily for 20 days, ethanol extracts of ground English walnut kernels given for 42 days, or whole English walnut kernels given for 42 days, reduce arthritis development, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, bone erosion, pannus formation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, paw edema, and serum rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein levels when compared with untreated controls. The leaf extracts also increase expression of anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-4 and decrease levels of prostaglandin-E2. They decrease expression of proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappa-B, IL-6, IL-1-beta, and cyclooxygenase-2, and inhibit carrageenan-, histamine-, serotonin-, and dextran-induced paw edema. (113405, 113407).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn an animal model, inclusion of walnuts 80 grams in the diet reduces prostate tumor growth. This might be associated with reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor 1. It is not clear which constituents in walnut might benefit prostate cancer growth, but the amount of fat is unlikely to play a role (97746).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary research in diabetic rodents shows that an ethanol extract of English walnut improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and reduces diabetic oxidative stress (113404).\nAntinociceptive effects\nEnglish walnut is used topically for the reduction of pain and swelling. In an animal model, English walnut extracts had antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. These effects do not seem to be related to opioid receptor activation (97748).\nAntioxidant effects\nResearch in rodents shows that English walnut oligopeptides increase levels of antioxidant enzymes in the liver, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, and reduce alcohol-induced oxidative stress products, including reactive oxygen species, protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde, and lipid oxidation products (113402). An ethanol extract of English walnut seed coat protects the activity of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione reductase and paraoxonase-1, and prevents damage caused by oxidative stress in the heart, liver, and kidneys of hyperlipidemic rats (113403).\nCardioprotective effects\nSome clinical research suggests that English walnut fruit can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, other constituents such as fiber, vitamin E, and folate might contribute to the apparent beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk (8478, 8955). Clinical research also suggests English walnuts might improve endothelial function, which might be beneficial in preventing atherosclerosis. In addition to alpha-linolenic acid, walnuts contain significant amounts of arginine, a precursor amino acid of the endogenous vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) (13301). English walnut leaf might have hypotensive, vasorelaxant, and smooth muscle stimulant effects (12979).\nCentral nervous system effects\nIn mice with cognitive dysfunction induced by a high-fat diet, an ethanol extract of English walnut reduces behavioral and memory dysfunction. It protects antioxidant and cholinergic systems in the brain, restores mitochondrial function in cerebral tissues, and reduces advanced glycation end products and malondialdehyde in the brain. It also reduces cerebral damage by regulating protein expression of the JNK signaling and apoptosis pathway. In cultures of neuronal and hippocampal cells, the extract preserves cell viability, inhibits production of reactive oxygen species, and prevents damage caused by neurotoxins such as hydrogen peroxide (113404).\nLiver effects\nIn a rodent model of acute alcohol-induced liver injury, English walnut oligopeptides, 440 or 880 mg/kg given by gastric gavage daily for 30 days reduce acute liver inflammation, liver enzyme levels (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase), diffuse liver enlargement, inclusion of fat droplets in hepatocytes, and hepatic steatosis. There is an increase in the activity of hepatic ethanol-metabolizing enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450-2E1, and enhanced hepatic antioxidant capacity, with increased levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1-beta, are reduced. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide, diamine oxidase, and beta-lactate are reduced, indicating a reduction in intestinal permeability associated with alcohol-induced epithelial cell damage. The oligopeptides also decrease blood ethanol concentrations and degree of intoxication in the rodents (113402).\nReproductive effects\nIn healthy men, eating 75 grams English walnuts daily seems to improve sperm vitality, motility, and normal appearance. The improvements correlated with increases in essential fatty acids, especially alpha-linolenic acid, in the blood (97747)."

            "Overview": "Ephedra is a stimulant herb usually taken from the stem and branches of Ephedra sinica. It has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (91807, 106337). Most Ephedra species contain ephedrine alkaloids which are responsible for their therapeutic effects and toxicity. However, species of Ephedra called Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis or Ephedra viridis) are alkaloid-free (10055). Ephedra is traditionally used for allergy symptoms, arthritis, asthma, bone pain, bronchitis, edema, headache, nephritis, and symptoms of the common cold and influenza.",
            "Warnings": "Ephedra use is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, International Olympic Committee, and National Football League (8642). Ephedra is sometimes marketed as \"herbal ecstasy\" for use as a recreational drug. The FDA has announced that ephedra products marketed as recreational drugs are unapproved and misbranded drugs subject to seizure and injunction (5047). Ephedra products have been banned in the US since April 2004 (10055).\n\nPrior to its removal from the US market, ephedra accounted for less than 1% of herbal product sales, but caused 64% of herbal adverse reaction reports to poison control centers (9170, 48774, 48773, 48772, 48768, 48766). Despite the ban, ephedra products are still available on the internet, often in combination with products providing caffeine and/or other stimulants such as synephrine, phenylethylamine (PEA), and yohimbine (106337). There is also considerable inter- and intra-product variability in labeled ephedra content, which adds to concern about ephedra toxicity (8643, 11336). Contaminants such as norpseudoephedrine, a schedule IV controlled substance, are also present in some products (8643). Until more is known, warn patients that the potential risks of using ephedra outweigh any potential benefit. Advise patients against using products containing ephedra, especially in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine, or if they have a pre-existing condition such as cardiovascular disease.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Ephedra can cause severe life-threatening or disabling adverse effects in some people. Ephedra is banned in the US. Several case reports have linked ephedra to serious side effects including hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), seizure, stroke, psychosis, and others (1276, 2729, 6486, 6998, 9167, 10689). Prolonged use or use of high doses might increase the risk of serious adverse effects (2729). Some suggest that ephedra is only harmful when used inappropriately in excessive doses or for prolonged periods. However, there are several cases of significant adverse events in patients who used ephedra short-term in relatively low doses ranging from 20-60 mg of ephedra alkaloids (2729, 6486). There is some evidence that people who take doses greater than 32 mg per day might have more than triple the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, including subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage (9167). It is not possible to determine who is at the greatest risk. However, people with pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disease or those using ephedra products in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine, might be at increased risk.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally.

In some cases, adverse effects can be severe or life-threatening. Large studies looking at the safety of ephedra have not been performed. Since most of the adverse effect data are from case reports, it is impossible to determine the overall incidence of these adverse effects. It is also difficult to determine which patient groups might be most likely to experience an adverse event.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Anorexia, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, difficulty urinating, dizziness, dry mouth, flushing, headache, heartburn, hyperthermia, hypertension, insomnia, irritability, nausea, personality changes, polydipsia, restlessness, tachycardia, tingling, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, hepatotoxicity, myocardial infarction, myopathies, psychosis, seizure, stroke, and sudden death.\nCardiovascular\nThe use of ephedra causes a 2.2- to 3.6-fold increase in the risk of developing psychiatric, autonomic, or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and cardiac palpitations (9740, 48878). Orally, ephedra use has been associated with cardiomyopathy (1270, 48801), hypersensitivity myocarditis (1271, 6487, 48738, 48739), chest tightness, myocardial infarction (6486), cardiac arrest and sudden death (1274, 6486), hypertension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias (6009, 8643, 35749, 35750, 37689, 48736, 48737, 48805, 48847, 48870, 48872). Ephedrine abuse has led to heart failure (48813). Even in healthy volunteers, EKG changes including prolonged QT interval and premature atrial contractions can occur with ingestion of recommended doses of ephedra containing products (11135, 11708). In a review of 926 cases reported to the FDA of possible adverse effects of ephedra, 37 patients had serious or fatal adverse reactions. Ephedra use was temporally related to 16 strokes, 10 myocardial infarctions, and 11 sudden deaths. These effects occurred in people aged 30-56 years. There is some evidence that people who take doses greater than 32 mg daily might have more than triple the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, including subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage, when compared with those taking doses of less than 32 mg daily (9167, 48771).\n\nEphedrine, the primary active ingredient in ephedra, has been associated with coronary artery spasm, myocardial injury with pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse (48867, 48872, 48783). However, several clinical trials evaluating ephedrine-caffeine combinations for weight loss reported no differences in mean heart rate or blood pressure when compared to placebo (37617, 48792, 48865, 48882). Other preliminary clinical research showed that ephedrine and caffeine use by prescription did not result in increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (48806).\nless\nEndocrine\nOne study in animals shows that some components of ephedra may lower blood glucose levels (48835). However, most human research suggests that ephedra and ephedrine, a component of ephedra, can raise blood glucose and insulin levels (3719, 12857, 48810).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nThe use of ephedra causes a 2.2- to 3.6-fold increase in the risk of developing psychiatric, autonomic, or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and cardiac palpitations (9740, 48878). Orally and intravenously, ephedra and ephedrine most commonly cause dry mouth, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal discomfort, and changes in stool consistency (1276, 3719, 6008, 6486, 8647, 10004, 10382, 37831, 48817, 48837). One case of ischemic colitis and symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea associated with the use of a weight loss supplement containing ephedra has been reported (48803).\nless\nHepatic\nCases of hepatotoxicity such as acute hepatitis and liver failure from ephedra-containing supplements have been reported. Some cases of hepatotoxicity resolved after discontinuation of ephedra, while others required liver transplantation. In obese patients using ephedra for weight loss, it is possible that ephedra exacerbated pre-existing liver disease. Onset of liver injury seems to occur an average of 3 months after ephedra ingestion, suggesting an idiosyncratic mechanism of liver injury (1273, 48747, 48800, 94875, 94876, 94877, 81600, 98441). Previously, it was thought that the cause of ephedra hepatotoxicity was an immune reaction or a contamination. However, since the majority of evidence suggests that hepatotoxicity is idiosyncratic, these prior postulations have since been dismissed (1273, 48747, 81600, 98441).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, ephedra has been reported to cause myopathies, including myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (1270, 16054, 48791).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nThe use of ephedra causes a 2.2- to 3.6-fold increase in the risk of developing psychiatric, autonomic, or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and cardiac palpitations (9740, 48878).

Of 33 seizures linked to dietary supplement use that were reported to the FDA over 7 years, 27 involved ephedra (13304). Other adverse events reported with ephedra use include sudden hearing loss, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and loss of consciousness (1275, 1381, 2729, 6486, 8643, 9167, 10005, 48746, 48862). In one case-control study, doses of ephedra above 32 mg daily have been associated with an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (9167).

In some cases psychosis can be prolonged for several months after discontinuation (1276, 6998, 10689). A case of a suicide attempt and mood disorder associated with the use of a diet pill containing ephedra has also been reported (48752).\n\nLong-term use of ephedra or use in high doses has been associated with dependence and tolerance (1381).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, ephedra has been reported to cause nephrolithiasis (1272, 48877), diuresis, urinary retention, and dysuria (16054, 48791).\nless",

However, it is unclear if this benefit is sustained long-term. Also, the use of ephedra for this purpose has been associated with significant adverse effects.\nOral ephedra seems to modestly improve weight loss. The typical dose is 15-40 mg of the ephedra alkaloids, calculated as ephedrine, taken up to three times daily. Caffeine 100-210 mg daily has sometimes been used in combination with ephedra and may further improve weight loss. In one study, ephedra extract 4 grams has been used daily for 8 weeks (9740, 9741, 37617, 37636, 37689, 91807, 106338). Specific combinations have also demonstrated modest benefits for weight loss. These combinations include ephedra 60 mg daily with cola nut and willow bark (12811), a specific combination product (Metabolife 356) containing ephedra (standardized to 72 mg of ephedrine), guarana, and 17 other ingredients daily 8 weeks (3719, 48817), and ephedra 90 mg with caffeine from cola nut 192 mg daily for 6 months (8647).\n\nDespite the possible effect on weight, using ephedra-containing products may be associated with significant adverse effects. Even in carefully screened and monitored otherwise healthy adults, ephedra combinations can cause small changes in blood pressure and heart rate (8647).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nCases of severe life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects have occurred with short-term use of relatively low doses of ephedra providing 20-60 mg ephedra alkaloids daily (6486). There is also considerable inter- and intra-product variability in labeled ephedra content, which adds to concern about ephedra toxicity (8643, 11336). Contaminants such as norpseudoephedrine, a schedule IV controlled substance, are also present in some products (8643).\n\nOrally, ephedra use has been associated with cardiomyopathy (1270, 48801), hypersensitivity myocarditis (1271, 6487, 48738, 48739), chest tightness, myocardial infarction (6486), cardiac arrest and sudden death (1274, 6486, 9167, 48771), hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias (6009, 8643, 35749, 35750, 37689, 48736, 48737, 48805, 48847, 48870, 48872), acute hepatitis and liver failure (1273, 48747, 48800, 94875, 94876, 94877, 81600, 98441), nephrolithiasis (1272, 48877), encephalopathy syndrome with multi-organ failure (48788), seizures (10307, 48870), and stroke (9167, 48771).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with ephedra.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nEphedra is absorbed faster if it is consumed as the powdered extract. However, onset of action and extent of absorption does not differ greatly between the powdered extract and the powdered herb (6008, 6009). Some sources claim ephedra is safer than pure ephedrine and pseudoephedrine because ephedrine from ephedra is absorbed more slowly. However, pharmacokinetic studies have found no differences in the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine from ephedra versus the purified form (6488).\nDistribution\nThe time to maximum concentration (Tmax) for ephedra is 2.4 hours (8644).\nMetabolism\nEphedra contains several alkaloids that can undergo reductions to form amphetamine and N,N-dimethylamphetamine; it is unknown to what extent this occurs in the body (48786).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of ephedra and ephedrine is 3-6.1 hours (8644, 12857). Following oral ephedra administration, 88% is excreted in the urine within 24 hours and 97% is excreted within 48 hours (48762). The ephedra constituents ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are excreted more rapidly with urinary acidifiers (such as ammonium chloride) and more slowly with urinary alkalinizers (such as disodium bicarbonate) (48762).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of ephedra is the stem and leaf (12813). Ephedra in dietary supplements is usually either a formulation of powdered stems and aerial portions or a dried extract (6488). Dried extracts contain more ephedra alkaloids per unit weight of material, due to the extraction process. The principal alkaloid constituents are ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and sometimes small amounts of phenylpropanolamine (6008, 6009). Other constituents that have been isolated include norpseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, and norephedrine (8644, 48762, 48799). Ephedra also contains tannins (48734, 48856).\n\nEphedrine and pseudoephedrine are both non-selective alpha- and beta-receptor agonists. The ephedrine and pseudoephedrine constituents can directly and indirectly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (12813).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEphedra has been used for allergies and other inflammatory conditions. The anti-inflammatory effects of ephedra have been demonstrated in preliminary clinical research (48814, 48852).\nAntitussive effects\nEphedrine has antitussive effects and can cause bronchodilation. It would reason that ephedra would also have some of these effects. The antitussive effects of ephedra have been demonstrated in animal research (48789).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe ephedra constituents ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility and cause peripheral vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and central nervous system stimulation (8644, 12857). A single dose of ephedra in combination with caffeine can increase heart rate from 67 beats per minute to 82 beats per minute in young, healthy people. The combination also increases systolic blood pressure and to a lesser extent, diastolic pressure (8644, 11355, 12856).\n\nEphedra alkaloids have been linked to myocarditis and myocardial infarction. This has been attributed to coronary artery vasoconstriction and possibly vasospasm caused by ephedra. Ephedra might also cause cardiac arrhythmia due to adrenergic effects that shorten the cardiac refractory period, causing re-entrant arrhythmias (6486). The weight loss product Metabolife 356, which contains ephedra and caffeine in addition to 17 other ingredients, prolongs the QT interval by an average of 27 milliseconds in healthy volunteers (11355). As an indicator of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, a prolonged QT interval increases the risk of potentially serious ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Atrial premature contractions have been demonstrated in healthy volunteers taking recommended doses of Metabolife 356 for 14 days (11708).\n\nCerebral hemorrhage associated with ephedra has been attributed primarily to hypertensive effects and possibly due to cerebral vasculitis, which has been reported with other adrenergic drugs. Ischemic stroke has been attributed to ephedra's vasoconstrictive effects on cerebral vasculature and possibly platelet aggregation effects due to adrenergic stimulation (6486).\nMetabolic effects\nEphedra plus caffeine increases resting energy expenditure (REE), but the increase in energy expenditure is negligible in terms of weight loss (12856). Ephedrine is thought to cause thermogenesis and modest short-term weight loss, possibly by stimulating norepinephrine release (48776, 48828, 48845, 48846, 48850, 48874, 106337). Additionally, some evidence shows that ephedrine inhibits gastric emptying which results in satiety and aids in weight loss (48798). In animal research, reduced food intake was related to an inhibition of the production of peptides involved in appetite control, as well as to changes in cellular metabolic activity (106338).\n\nSome evidence suggests that aspirin and caffeine might act synergistically with ephedrine for weight loss by inhibiting prostaglandin, which increases norepinephrine release (314, 729, 10003, 48826, 48831, 48863, 48864). There is some evidence that ephedrine alone or in combination with caffeine can improve anaerobic exercise performance. Ephedrine causes catecholamine release and increases CNS stimulation, which may lead to better performance (8646).\nMuscular effects\nAlthough ephedra is often included in muscle development products, preliminary research suggests ephedra does not affect muscle precursor cells called satellite cells, which are thought to cause muscular hypertrophy (13773).\nNeurologic effects\nThe ephedra constituents ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can cause central nervous system (CNS) stimulation (8644). The CNS stimulation is likely caused by catecholamine release which in turn which may lead to better exercise performance (8646).\nRespiratory effects\nThe ephedra constituents ephedrine and pseudoephedrine can cause bronchodilation (8644). Ephedrine, which was used in combination with theophylline and phenobarbital for many years to treat asthma, causes bronchodilation and increased oxygen consumption (8645)."

S-equol appears to be the only enantiomer formed after bacterial daidzein conversion and is thought to be responsible for the biological effects of equol (103205, 103206). The extent to which S-equol is formed varies depending on soy content of the diet, age, ethnicity, and other factors.

However, no change in hot flash frequency was seen at the 30 mg dose, and lower doses of 10 mg daily were not effective for improving total symptom scores (19072). However, in the other clinical trial, S-equol 10 mg daily for 12 weeks reduced hot flash frequency by 59%, compared with a 35% reduction in the placebo groups. Additionally, hot flash severity and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness improved in the S-equol group when compared with placebo (19073). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal Japanese patients shows that taking equol (FlavoCel EQ-5, Daicel Corp.) 10 mg daily for 3 months reduces menopausal symptom scores when compared with placebo. Scores were reduced by 81% and 53% with equol and placebo, respectively. Improvements in menopausal symptoms were reported regardless of equol producing status (107438).\n\nMost clinical research has been conducted in Japanese patients; however, one clinical trial has evaluated equol in North Americans. In this study, postmenopausal adults taking S-equol 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily had similar reductions in hot flash frequency to those treated with a soy isoflavone tablet containing 24 mg daidzein, 22 mg genistein, and 2 mg glycitein. Hot flashes were reduced by around three events per day after 8 weeks of supplementation. Those taking S-equol 10 mg and 20 mg daily had modest reductions in muscle and joint pain when compared with soy isoflavone. The 20 mg and 40 mg doses were superior to soy isoflavone for reducing hot flash frequency in subjects with more than 8 hot flashes a day (19075). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo comparator group.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral S-equol is beneficial for aging skin.\nA small clinical trial in postmenopausal, equol nonproducing Japanese adults shows that taking a specific S-equol supplement (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 10 mg or 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces crow's feet wrinkle area when compared with placebo. Taking S-equol 30 mg also decreased wrinkle depth by 4.5%, compared with an increase of 6.5% in the placebo group. No differences were noted for skin hydration, skin elasticity, or trans-epidermal water loss (19077).\nless\nBreast cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral equol for breast cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of equol for this purpose.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral equol is beneficial for preventing or treating CVD.\nOne small, low-quality study in Japanese females shows that taking 10 mg of a specific equol supplement (FlavoCel EQ-5, Daicel Corp.) daily for one year reduces arterial stiffness and triglyceride levels when compared to baseline (99643). However, this study included both pre- and post-menopausal patients, equol producers and nonproducers, and patients who were receiving hormone replacement therapy as well as those that were not. The validity of these findings is further reduced by the lack of a control group. Observational research in Japanese males aged 40 to 79 without cardiovascular (CV) or chronic kidney disease suggests that being an equol producer is associated with 38% lower odds of aortic calcification compared with equol nonproducers (110530). However, this association was not shown in other observational research of Japanese males aged 40 to 49 years without CV disease (110529).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral equol is beneficial for preventing or treating cognitive impairment.\nObservational research in elderly Japanese adults has found that being an equol producer is associated with an 8% incidence of mild cognitive impairment, compared with a 21% incidence in equol nonproducers (100334).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral equol is beneficial for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nObservational research in Chinese adults has found that greater concentrations of equol in the urine are associated with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes (103203). However, it is unknown whether supplementation with equol is effective for diabetes treatment or prevention.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral equol for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of equol for this purpose.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral S-equol is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in overweight or obese Japanese adults shows that taking S-equol (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 10 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) scores when compared with placebo. These effects were more profound in females who were equol nonproducers. Taking equol did not affect body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels (19078). Observational research in females aged 54-64 years in Japan suggests that the incidence of metabolic syndrome is 7% in equol producers compared with 11% in equol nonproducers. Equol producers also have modestly lower body weight, body mass index, and triglycerides than equol nonproducers (110527).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral equol is beneficial for lean NAFLD.\nA large observational study in Japanese adults suggests the incidence of equol production is 43% in males who do not develop lean NAFLD compared with 8% in males who do develop lean NAFLD (110528). However, it is unknown whether supplementation with equol is effective for NAFLD prevention or treatment.\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral S-equol is beneficial in patients with osteoporosis.\nA small clinical trial in postmenopausal, equol nonproducing Japanese adults shows that taking a specific S-equol supplement (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 10 mg daily for one year reduces urinary deoxypyridinoline, a biomarker of bone resorption, by around 21% when compared with placebo. Taking equol also attenuated a reduction in whole body bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with placebo; however, no benefit was seen in lumbar spine or total hip BMD (19076).\n\nWhile this preliminary study in equol non-producers shows some promising results, it is unclear whether providing daidzen to equol producers is beneficial for BMD. One clinical study in postmenopausal, equol-producing Chinese adults shows that taking soy flour 40 grams or purified daidzein 63 mg daily for 6 months does not improve bone turnover markers when compared to baseline (107437).\nless\nProstate cancer.

However, other observational studies have found that equol producers have a reduced risk of breast cancer (19265, 19266). Also, one observational study in patients with breast cancer has found that higher dietary intake of soy isoflavones is linked to a 21% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared with lower soy isoflavone intake (94154). Additionally, equol does not seem to stimulate tumor growth in animal models (19267, 19268).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with equol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nEquol has high oral bioavailability and is more bioavailable than other soy isoflavones (19090, 19263, 100334). Peak plasma concentrations of equol are reached in 1-2 hours when taken without food and 2-3 hours when taken with food (19090).\nMetabolism\nS-equol undergoes conjugation via uridine diphosphate-5'-glucuronosyltransferase (19090).\nExcretion\nEquol demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics, with a half-life of 7-8 hours. After renal elimination, equol is found in the urine predominantly as the 7-glucuronide conjugate (19090).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEquol is an isoflavan produced when the soy isoflavone daidzein undergoes biotransformation via specific intestinal bacteria, including Asaccharobacter celatus and Slackia isoflanoniconvertans. S-equol dosed at 8-15 mg daily corresponds to the amount of equol produced by equol producers upon consumption of 6-11 grams of soy daily (19088). Equol is chemically classified as a nonsteroidal estrogen. While it exists as both S- and R-enantiomers, only the S-enantiomer is produced in humans and animals and only S-equol is thought to have biological activity in the body (19082, 19083, 103205, 103206). Approximately 40% to 60% of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese adults, as well as vegetarians from Western countries, are capable of producing equol. Only 20-30% of Western, non-vegetarian adults produce equol (19082). It has been hypothesized that the health benefits of soy are more profound in those people who are equol producers. A number of dietary intervention studies evaluating the effects of soy have shown larger clinical responses in individuals with higher plasma S-equol concentrations (19084).\nAnti-androgenic effects\nEquol binds to the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), forming a DHT-equol complex. This complex inhibits DHT's ability to bind to its receptor. While equol does not bind to the androgen receptor specifically, animal studies have demonstrated that equol inhibits the stimulatory effects of DHT on prostate growth (11034).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro studies suggest that equol induces apoptosis in cancer cells via a variety of mechanisms, including activating p53, inhibiting the expression of NFkB, and activating caspase-3 (19256, 19257, 19258).\nBone effects\nThe effects of S-equol in osteoporosis and bone are unclear. Estrogen receptor beta is expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts (19087). It is hypothesized that S-equol may play a role in activating estrogen receptor beta on these cells, ultimately regulating the expression of bone-specific genes (19088).\nCardiovascular effects\nEquol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasorelaxant properties, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular disease. Compared to daidzein and genistein, racemic equol has the highest antioxidant activity (19091, 19092, 19093, 19094). In vitro, equol inhibits low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation (19095). Equol has also been reported to increase nitric oxide (NO) production by increasing the transcription of inducible endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (19088). Equol has been shown to have vasorelaxant properties in animal and in vitro studies (19081, 19100, 19254, 19255). In vitro and animal studies suggest that equol has diuretic effects via inhibition of the Na-K-Cl co-transport system (19081, 19261, 19262). While equol increases water, sodium, and potassium excretion, this effect is 3-4-times less potent than furosemide (19081).\nEstrogenic effects\nS-equol binds to estrogen receptor alpha, although its affinity for this receptor is only 2% of that of 17-estradiol. R-equol shows a weak affinity for estrogen receptors, with a preference toward estrogen receptor alpha. S-equol has a stronger affinity for estrogen receptor beta, which is approximately 20% that of estradiol. Because S-equol binds preferentially to estrogen receptor beta, it has characteristics similar to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (7657, 19083, 19085, 103206). These effects on estrogen receptors are thought to explain S-equol's activity in menopausal symptom relief (19072, 19073, 19074, 19075).\nLabor effects\nEquol stimulates prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2ɑ) secretion in vitro (19097, 19098). PGF2ɑ is a labor-inducing prostaglandin (19096).\nSkin effects\nThere is interest in using S-equol for improving the appearance of aging skin. Dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes express estrogen receptors. Therefore, the binding activity of S-equol on estrogen receptors is theorized to possess skin antiaging properties (19077)."

            "Overview": "Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring sulfur-containing amino acid. It is only synthesized by certain types of fungi, but can accumulate in plants and animals (48893, 97669). It was first identified in rye ergot fungus in 1909 (97667, 97668). Dietary sources include mushrooms, chicken or pork liver, pork kidney, oat bran, and beans (48900).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nAfter oral intake, ergothioneine is taken up by the membrane carnitine / organic cation transporter, OCTN1/SLC22A4. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is stored in erythrocytes, ocular tissues, seminal fluid, the ileum, liver, brain, and kidneys (14848, 14849, 14855, 111218). The concentration of ergothioneine in these tissues is dose-dependent (14849).\nMetabolism\nErgothioneine is oxidized to hercynine and S-methyl-ergothioneine (97667).\nExcretion\nErgothioneine is retained in the body, with less than 4% of a dose excreted as metabolites in the urine, where levels are related to dietary and plasma levels (97667, 111219). Based on animal research, ergothioneine is thought to be actively reabsorbed in the kidney (48901).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nErgothioneine is a sulfur-containing, thiohistidine betaine amino acid and hydrophilic antioxidant. It is synthesized by fungi and mycobacteria that are found in the soil. It is then taken up by plants and animals in the food chain. Ergothioneine can be found in ergot and the king crab (Limulus polyphemus). The main source of ergothioneine in the diet is edible mushrooms. Other good sources are red and black beans (14847, 97667, 97668, 111218, 111219). Meat can also contain ergothioneine if the animal grazed on grass containing it (14851).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal models, ergothioneine supplementation decreases tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and increases heat shock proteins (HSP) (14847). It also reduces TNF-alpha activation of nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kappa beta) and IL-8 in lung tissues (14852). Despite these actions in some laboratory models, ergothioneine did not reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in humans (97667).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome of the physiological effects of ergothioneine might be related to its antioxidant properties. In vitro, ergothioneine has greater free radical antioxidant activity than glutathione, trolox, and uric acid (14848). It also inhibits lipid peroxidation and helps maintain glutathione and alpha-tocopherol levels in the kidneys and liver, in vitro and in animal models (14850, 14851). In vitro, ergothioneine is an efficient scavenger of various reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, hypochlorous acid, and peroxynitrite (97667).\n\nIn vitro, ergothioneine reduces DNA damage caused by peroxynitrite in neuronal cells, and reduces the neurotoxicity of glutamate (14853, 14854). However, in one animal model, ergothioneine did not reduce oxidative myocardial ischemic damage (14856). Additionally, ergothioneine did not prevent oxidative damage to proteins or reduce urinary markers of oxidative stress in human research (97667).\nDermatological effects\nLaboratory research shows that ergothioneine protects against ultraviolet irradiation by protecting against reactive oxygen species and downstream cell signaling (97667).\nEffects on memory\nErgothioneine levels are reduced in older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment. Research in animals shows that ergothioneine enhances object recognition memory, possibly through promotion of neuronal maturation in the hippocampus. In cultured hippocampal neurons, ergothioneine increases expression of neurotrophins 3 and 5, and of the synapse formation marker, synapsin 1 (111218).\nEffects on preeclampsia\nResearch in animals shows that ergothioneine reduces hypertension associated with pre-eclampsia and increases fetal weight. It also decreases serum levels of the soluble antiangiogenic mediator, sFlt-1, which are elevated in pre-eclampsia (111219).\nExercise effects\nResearch in animals running on a treadmill shows that ergothioneine extends the time to exhaustion by about 40%, and improves muscle recovery. Two hours after exercising, muscles of animals treated with ergothioneine exhibit greater activation of protein synthesis, and reduced expression of markers of metabolic stress, such as AMPK-alpha phosphorylation, and markers of inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukins 1-beta and 6 (111216).\nHepatic effects\nResearch in animal models of diabetes shows that ergothioneine can reduce development of liver hypertrophy, elevated liver enzyme levels, oxidative stress, inflammation, and elevated triglyceride levels. Ergothioneine reduces expression of SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase to lower triglyceride levels, reduce hepatic lipogenesis, and attenuate hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation. It also promotes beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the hepatic mitochondria, and reduces lipid peroxidation, preventing damage to cell membranes. Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis are reduced by the downregulation of expression of nuclear factor kappa B and transforming growth factor beta. Oxidative damage is reduced by upregulation of the transcription factors nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and sirtuin-1, which increase antioxidant production (111214).\nKidney effects\nResearch in animal models of diabetes shows that ergothioneine can reduce development of functional and structural changes that lead to kidney failure. It reduces kidney hypertrophy, fibrosis, mesangial expansion, and damage to nephron basement membranes, and enhances integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. It reduces levels of the marker of kidney oxidative stress, malondialdehyde. Ergothioneine also reverses the increases in serum creatinine and triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, proteinuria, urine volume, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation that occur in untreated diabetic rats. Mechanisms for these effects include increasing expression of cytoprotective genes and antioxidant transcription factors, leading to increased levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. There is also decreased expression of inflammatory genes and levels of inflammatory biomarkers including tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor beta. An increase in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) expression leads to activation of the antioxidant signaling pathway and enhancement of the renal antioxidant defense system (111215).\nNeuroprotective effects\nErgothioneine is found in high levels in the brain, suggesting a neuroregulatory function (97669). In vitro, ergothioneine reduces the formation of beta-amyloid proteins and reduces cell death induced by beta-amyloid proteins (14850). Ergothioneine also appears to reduce DNA damage caused by peroxynitrite in neuronal cells, reduce the neurotoxicity of glutamate, and ameliorate the neuropathic effects of oxaliplatin. The latter effect may be explained by reduced accumulation of oxaliplatin in dorsal root ganglion neurons (14853, 14854, 102098). In an animal model, supplementation of ergothioneine in the embryonic phase reduces the rate of malformations in offspring, including neural tube defects (14853)."

A systematic review describes the characteristics of 49 children and 61 adults with seizures associated with various routes of administration. Patients with no seizure history were classified as a eucalyptus oil-induced seizure (EOIS), while patients with a history of seizure or susceptibility to seizure were defined as a eucalyptus oil-provoked seizure (EOPS). In EOIS cases, topical use was reported in 74%, inhalation in 22.5%, and ingestion in 3.5%; for EOPS cases, topical use was reported in 79%, inhalation in 16%, and ingestion in 5%. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the most prominent type of seizure in EOIS cases (96%). Among EOPS patients, 37% had focal onset motor seizures with impaired awareness, 24% had focal onset aware motor seizures, 13% had focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, and 26% had generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures (107494). One prospective observational study that was included in this systematic review provided additional details on eucalyptus-induced seizures. This study included 18 reports of EOIS and 28 reports of EOPS in adults and children after topical or inhaled use of eucalyptus oil, either alone or in combination with camphor. The time to seizure onset was 0.5-48 hours after topical application, 2-30 minutes after inhalation, and 0.5-6 hours after ingestion. (105028).\n\nOne prospective observational study and one case series have described 20 case reports of seizures occurring in children after ingestion of eucalyptus oil. Most of these seizures are generalized tonic-clonic in nature, occur 15-30 minutes after exposure, and do not reoccur following the discontinuation of eucalyptus oil. Seizures have been reported with both overdoses and therapeutic doses (107493, 107495) and include cases of both EOIS and EOPS (107495). Additionally, children appear more likely to require intensive care and mechanical ventilation when compared with adult cases (107494).\n\nA case of fever and headache has been reported in a patient who routinely applied a teaspoon of gel containing eucalyptus extract in his throat or nose to treat sore throat or rhinitis (48946).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe eucalyptol constituent of eucalyptus is well absorbed via inhalation with the peak plasma level occurring at 18 minutes (48999).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of eucalyptus are the leaf and oil (12870). Constituents of the leaf and twigs include the monocyclic sesquiterpenoid litseagermacrane, prenylated phloroglucinols, methylated flavons, and triterpenes (98493). Other constituents include the macrocarpals (98494). The oil contains terpenes such as eucalyptol (cineole), pinenes, phellandrene, and limonene, among others (98495).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe eucalyptol constituent of eucalyptus oil appears to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (12866). Preliminary research suggests eucalyptol might block the production of arachidonic acid metabolites that mediate pain. It might also inhibit cyclooxygenase pathways (12866, 13302). Eucalyptol and other constituents also seem to inhibit the production of cytokines responsible for inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2 (49008, 49007, 98493). Ethanolic extracts of eucalyptus leaf also seem to have anti-inflammatory activity (13458). This might explain its use in asthma (12866).\nAnti-lice effects\nEucalyptus oil is used in some topical solutions for head lice. Ovicidal effects of terpenes found in the oil have been shown in vitro (98495).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, eucalyptus extract has apoptotic and antiproliferative effects on pancreatic cancer cells. The constituents of interest seem to be the polyphenols, which appear to interfere with normal cell functions (98496).\nAntimicrobial effects\nEucalyptus leaf extracts and isolated constituents seem to have antimicrobial and antifungal activity (12870, 98493).\nAntiviral effects\nIsolated constituents of eucalyptus, such as grandinol, sideroxylin, and tereticornate A have antiviral effects against HSV-1 in vitro. Cypellocarpin C and litseagermacrane have antiviral effects against HSV-2 (98493).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAn aqueous extract of eucalyptus leaf appears to have hypoglycemic activity. Preliminary research shows that it increases insulin secretion and enhances the uptake and metabolism of glucose by muscle (12871). Additional research also shows that eucalyptus leaf can significantly decrease basal glucose levels in animal models of diabetes. Eucalyptus might also help decrease polydipsia associated with hyperglycemia (14907).\nImmunologic effects\nIn rats treated with eucalyptol once daily for 3 weeks, doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg upregulated the function of phagocytic CD8 cells in alveolar lavage fluid, but had no effect on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis. At a dose of 300 mg/kg, both CD8 and macrophage phagocytosis were inhibited and levels of blood B-cells and natural killer cells were reduced. There was no significant effect on CD4, T-cell, IgG, IgM, or interferon-gamma levels at any dose (104959).\nInsect repellant\nPreliminary research shows that eucalyptus oil has insect repellant effects (48968).\nToxic effects\nEucalyptus oil contains eucalyptol, which can cause seizures when consumed in high doses (12868). Eucalyptus and eucalyptus oil also contain the very toxic hydrocyanic acid (13303)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nResearch in rats suggests that berberine, the primary constituent in European barberry, has poor oral and intestinal absorption. Berberine has a bioavailability of <1% after oral administration (94825). Berberine appears to undergo extensive phase I hepatic metabolism. It also appears to be a substrate of nuclear transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter. This seems to result in its low oral bioavailability (13525).\n\nIn animal models, berberine taken orally reaches a maximum serum concentration 2.4 hours after ingestion (33717).\nDistribution\nResearch in rats shows that berberine, the primary constituent in European barberry, given orally distributes into the liver, kidneys, muscle, lungs, brain, heart, pancreas, and adipose tissues. Furthermore, 4 hours after oral administration, the levels of berberine are higher in the tissues compared to the plasma (94825).\nMetabolism\nAnimal research shows that berberine, the primary constituent in European barberry, is primary metabolized by oxidative demethylation and glucuronidation. Further research in vivo suggests that berberine is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymes (94825).\nExcretion\nAnimal research shows that berberine, the primary constituent in European barberry, is primarily excreted in the feces (94825).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of European barberry are the fruit (berry), root, and bark (13527). The primary active constituent of European barberry is berberine, a yellow, crystalline, bitter alkaloid (13519). Other constituents of European barberry are oxyacanthine, berbamine, berberrubine, bervulcine, columbamine, isotetrandine, jatorrhizine, oxycanthine, palmatine, vulcracine (33603), anthocyanins (33688), carbohydrates, organic acids, some vitamins, polyphenolic compounds, N-(p-trans-coumaroyl)tyramine (33615), cannabisin G (33615), lyoniresinol (33615), flavonols (33625), pectin, tannin, and mineral elements (33595).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary research in animals suggests that European barberry hydroethanolic extract has analgesic effects as shown by the acid-induced writhing test and tail-flick test models. In animals, it seems to be less effective than morphine but comparable to amitriptyline (94825).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEuropean barberry root also seems to have anti-inflammatory activity, which is possibly mediated by its alkaloid constituents such as berberine (13529,33582,33592 ). Preliminary research suggests berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488, 33582). Whether European barberry has the same clinical effects as berberine is unknown.\nAnticholinergic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that European barberry fruit and its constituent berberine have anticholinergic effects (13527, 33646).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is mixed evidence about the antidiabetic effects of European barberry. Preliminary research suggests that berberine, a constituent in European barberry, might lower blood glucose, inhibit aldose reductase, and improve insulin resistance (13520, 33641, 33667). In clinical research, European barberry reduced blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes who were also taking antidiabetes medications (98575). A meta-analysis of studies in patients both with and without type 2 diabetes shows that European barberry reduces insulin levels, but has no effect on fasting blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, or homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (105758). Another meta-analysis including studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemic disorders shows that European barberry significantly decreases fasting blood glucose levels (105756). The validity of both analyses is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\nAntihistamine effects\nPreliminary research suggests that European barberry fruit has antihistaminic effects (13527).\nAntimicrobial effects\nBerberine has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Leishmania donovani, and Trichomonas vaginalis (2530, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012, 33640, 33653, 33683, 33690, 33703). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540).\n\nWhether European barberry has the same clinical effects as berberine is unknown.\nAntineoplastic effects\nPreliminary in vitro research suggests that berberine, a constituent in European barberry, has antineoplastic effects against hepatomas, leukemia cells, cancer cells of the testes, lung cancer cells, sarcoma cells, and brain tumor cells (33587, 33621, 33631, 33635, 33657, 33666, 33678). The antineoplastic effects of berberine have been attributed to its inhibitory activity against certain proteins and DNA synthesis essential for carcinogenesis (33582, 33680). Whether European barberry has the same clinical effects as berberine is unknown. However, some preliminary clinical research in women with benign breast disease shows that drinking European barberry juice 480 mL daily for 8 weeks decreases the expression of PPAR, VEGF, and HIF, suggesting that it might prevent the development of tumors in these women (102054).\nAntioxidant effects\nBerberine, a constituent of European barberry, seems to have antioxidant effects similar to those of vitamin E (33684). Protoberberine, another constituent of European barberry, demonstrates antioxidant properties by inhibiting lipoxygenase and lipid peroxidation in vitro (33656, 33581).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is mixed evidence about the cardiovascular effects of European barberry. The primary active constituent of European barberry is berberine (13519). In animal research, berberine has antihypertensive properties, including apparent alpha-adrenergic blocking activity (13526, 33589, 33637, 33707, 33708, 33709). Laboratory research suggests European barberry fruit has vasodilatory and hypotensive effects (13528, 33604, 33691, 33692). A small clinical study in patients with hypertension shows that taking a milled dried powder of European barberry 10 grams daily for 8 weeks significantly improves vascular endothelial function as assessed by increases in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery and decreases in plasma levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and macrophage/monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP-1), markers reflecting inflammation and activation of vascular endothelial cells (105759). The validity of these findings is limited by the single-blinded nature of the study and the operator-dependent measurement of the primary FMD outcome. Conversely, a meta-analysis of studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease shows that taking European barberry has no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure (105757). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\n\nIn animal research, berberine has also demonstrated inotropic and antiarrhythmic properties (33589, 33637, 33707, 33708, 33709). Preliminary clinical research suggests that berberine might reduce arrhythmias and improve left ventricular function in patients with heart failure (13526). Animal research suggests that berberine reduces premature ventricular beats and stops ventricular tachycardia (33608, 33636, 94825). Animal research also shows that berberine increases cardiac output and decreases total peripheral resistance (33710). Laboratory research suggests that berberine might also lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (13520, 33701). A meta-analysis of studies in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemic disorders shows that European barberry significantly decreases LDL and triglyceride levels (105756). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\n\nIn vitro and animal evidence suggest that berberine, a constituent of European barberry, might inhibit platelet aggregation (33591, 33660, 33694). Whether European barberry has the same clinical effects as berberine is unknown.\n\nIn human research, European barberry juice increased levels of paraoxonase-1, an antioxidant enzyme considered to be cardioprotective (98575).\nDermatologic effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests berberine, a constituent of European barberry, might be useful for topical treatment of burns and trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries (13523, 13526).\nGastrointestinal effects\nTraditionally European barberry has been used for gastrointestinal conditions such as heartburn, stomach cramps, and lack of appetite. Berberine, a constituent in European barberry, has gastrointestinal effects such as reducing the secretion of gastric acid and delaying small intestinal transit time which may contribute to the traditional uses of European barberry (13537, 33659).\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that berberine, a constituent of European barberry, blocks production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. Berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha (13522).\n\nOther preliminary research suggests berberine might have antitumor effects and might protect the liver from hepatotoxins (13519, 13521).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal research, berberine, a constituent of European barberry, has been shown to improve amnesia induced by scopolamine (33664). It might also reduce neural cell excitability (13528). Whether European barberry has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nOsteoporosis effects\nPreliminary research in vitro shows that berberine, a constituent in European barberry, has been shown to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density, inhibit parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone resorption, and induce apoptosis of osteoclastic cells (33580). Whether European barberry has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nRenal effects\nEuropean barberry is used traditionally for kidney stones. Preliminary research in animal models suggests an aqueous-methanol European barberry root bark extract inhibited the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules and improved renal function (33626)."

Phenolic acids from European chestnut shells are more extensively absorbed than tannins and lignans (112985, 112986).\nMetabolism\nIn rats, the hydrolysable tannins such as ellagitannin present in European chestnut bark extract are partially metabolized to ellagic acid in the intestines, and then to urolithins by colonic bacteria. The urolithins are systemically absorbed (108739).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of European chestnut are the leaf, bark, and shells (54744, 97860, 97862, 97863). European chestnut leaf contains tannins, including castalagin and vescalagin (12, 112984). The bark also contains various tannins, including vescalagin, castalagin, vescalin, castalin, gallic acid, ellagitannin, and ellagic acid (97862, 108739, 112984). The leaf also contains pentacyclic triterpenes and oleanene and ursene derivatives (97860). Antioxidant flavonoid constituents include rutin, hesperidin, quercetrin, isoquercitrin, apigenin, morin, galangin, and kaempferol (54744, 97861). Chestnut shells also contain various phenolic acids, tannins, and flavinoids (112985, 112986).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEuropean chestnut is thought to have anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro research shows that European chestnut leaf extract inhibits interleukin-8 release in cells (112984).\nAntibacterial effects\nEuropean chestnut leaf extract reduces the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus in laboratory and animal models. The constituent oleanene and ursene derivatives might play a role (97860). In vitro, European chestnut leaf extract has antibacterial effects against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antioxidant flavonoids quercetin, rutin, and apigenin may be involved (54744). In vitro research in human gastric epithelium (GES-1) cells infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) shows that European chestnut leaf extract reduces H. pylori growth and impairs H. pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells (112984).\nAntioxidant effects\nEuropean chestnut is thought to have antioxidant activity. Animal research shows that taking European chestnut shell extract reduces lipid peroxidation, augments superoxide dismutase, and enhances glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood, liver and kidney (112985, 112986).\nMetabolic effects\nIn a rat model of metabolic syndrome induced by a high-fat diet, European chestnut bark extract (ECBE), 20 mg/kg daily for 21 days, reduces food intake and weight gain. It also attenuates metabolic syndrome-associated increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The high-fat diet reduces cardiac parasympathetic activity, but this is reversed by ECBE, with restoration of muscarinic function. ECBE reverses the positive chronotropic effect of the high-fat diet, and also has a spasmolytic effect in isolated aorta preparations (108739).

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "European mistletoe is a parasitic plant that grows on several different trees, including deciduous trees, fruit or nut trees, fir trees, and pine trees. It is found in Europe, northwest Africa, and southern and central Asia (93261, 93270). European mistletoe has a history of use in traditional medicine, and more recently, its extracts have been explored for clinical use in oncological settings (112993).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously and appropriately. There is some evidence that European mistletoe extracts can be used safely (7039, 9769, 15351, 24773, 24778, 93261, 93266, 93267, 96487, 107285)(112991, 112993). However, they have a narrow therapeutic range; high doses are not safe. Tell patients not to consume more than three mistletoe berries or two leaves (12). Advise patients not to use European mistletoe for self-medication.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Ingestion of high doses of mistletoe berry or leaf can cause serious adverse reactions. More than three berries or two leaves can cause seizures, bradycardia, hypotension, and death (7039).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally or subcutaneously. European mistletoe might have uterine stimulant and abortifacient activity (19).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, European mistletoe seems to be well tolerated when used in small amounts. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted. Parenterally, European mistletoe may be safe when administered by a healthcare provider. High oral or parenteral doses may be unsafe.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, intestinal cramps, and vomiting at high doses.\n\nParenterally: Chills, diarrhea, eosinophilia, fever, flatulence, headache, malaise, nausea, pruritus, vomiting, and pain and inflammation at the injection site.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hepatitis, seizures, coma, and death at high doses.\n\nParenterally: Necrosis at injection site. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in sensitive individuals.\nCardiovascular\nSubcutaneously, European mistletoe may cause angina and orthostatic circulatory disturbances (7044, 7045, 9769).\nless\nDermatologic\nSubcutaneously and intravenously, European mistletoe may cause pruritus, skin rash, and angioedema (93261, 93265, 93266, 96476, 107285, 107286, 112993). When administered subcutaneously, the use of an extended dose-escalation regimen may limit the development of localized reactions in comparison to rapid dose escalation (96476).\nless\nEndocrine\nIntravenously, aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, may cause hypokalemia (16385).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, European mistletoe may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps (18). Intraperitoneal and intratumoral injection may cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (7106, 93264, 96495). Subcutaneously, European mistletoe may cause flatulence, loose stools, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (93261, 93265). Intravenously, aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, may cause nausea and vomiting (16385, 93261).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIntravenously, aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, may change urinary frequency (16385, 93261).\nless\nHematologic\nSubcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or intratumorally, European mistletoe may cause eosinophilia (7044, 7045, 7106, 9769).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, European mistletoe has been associated with two cases of hepatotoxicity when used in combination with other herbal ingredients. In one case, in which a patient took a combination herbal product, it was deemed unlikely that European mistletoe was the causative agent. It was determined to be most likely due to another ingredient or product contamination (3932). In another case, a previously healthy male presented to the hospital with mild fever, brownish urine, and elevated liver function enzymes after frequent use of European mistletoe extract for 1 month and kudzu root extract for 10 days. Upon discontinuation of the two extracts, liver function slowly returned to normal with no other symptoms (88777). It is unclear if European mistletoe, kudzu, or the combination was responsible for this adverse effect.\n\nIntravenously, aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, may cause elevated liver enzymes (16385, 93261).\nless\nImmunologic\nSubcutaneously, European mistletoe may cause allergic reactions (7044, 7045, 9769) or flu-like symptoms or mild infections (93261). Early research shows that European mistletoe is not associated with an increase in side effects when it is administered in conjunction with targeted cancer treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapy regimens, including PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitors (96490, 96489). There are two case reports of apparent immunologic response to the application of European mistletoe for pleurodesis, resulting in acute respiratory distress and pneumonitis (96488, 96494).\n\nThere are at least 5 reports of anaphylactic reactions associated with subcutaneous European mistletoe extract (15352, 107286). In one case, anaphylaxis did not occur until after 2 years of treatment with European mistletoe (15352). Aviscumine has also been associated with anaphylactic reactions in people who have previously used European mistletoe products (16385).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nSubcutaneous, intratumoral, intraperitoneal, and intravenous administration of European mistletoe can cause pain at the injection site (7044, 7045, 9769, 93264, 93266, 7106, 93261, 96495). There is one report of a benign abdominal wall mass developing at the European mistletoe injection site, which was likely the result of a local inflammatory response (15350). Necrosis can also occur at the site of injection (8).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, European mistletoe may cause seizures, coma, and death (18). Subcutaneously, European mistletoe can cause headaches (7044, 7045, 9769, 93261, 93265) or fatigue or malaise (93261, 93265). When injected into the tumor, European mistletoe can cause headaches (93264, 96495). Intravenous infusion of aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, can cause fatigue (16385, 93261).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, European mistletoe may cause contraction of the pupil and uncontrollable eye movement (18). Subcutaneously, European mistletoe may cause dry eyes (93261).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nThere are multiple reports of acute respiratory effects after application of European mistletoe for pleurodesis. In one case, a 52-year-old male presenting with pneumothorax received European mistletoe extract 40 mg (ABNOBAviscum F, ABNOBA Helmittel GmbH) with 50 mL of normal saline into the pleural space. After 3 days, the patient experienced worsening dyspnea with right pleural effusion and bilateral lung infiltration requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation (96488). In another case, a 58-year-old male presenting with postoperative pleural effusion received pleurodesis with European mistletoe extract 500 mg (ABNOBAviscum F) on days 6, 8, 12, and 16 after surgery. Imaging revealed apparent acute respiratory distress and pneumonitis, but without corresponding clinical symptoms, which improved after 5 days of supportive care (96494). In a small retrospective study, 28% of elderly patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax who underwent chemical pleurodesis with European mistletoe extract 60 mg (Abnova Viscum-F) in 50 mL of normal saline experienced dyspnea with associated desaturation. These adverse effects were attributed to pain caused by the induced pleural inflammation, and may have also been related to the patients' underlying impaired pulmonary function. Treatment with oxygen via nasal cannula resulted in improvement of symptoms in most patients within 24 hours (105838).\nless\nOther\nSubcutaneously, intravenously, and intratumorally, European mistletoe can cause malaise, chills, and high fever (7044, 7045, 9769, 93261, 93264, 93265, 93266, 93268, 96495, 99499). Intravenous infusion of aviscumine, a pure form of mistletoe lectin I produced by recombinant DNA techniques, can cause fever (16385, 93261).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHead and neck cancer. Subcutaneous European mistletoe extract does not seem to improve survival in patients with head and neck cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA large clinical trial in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma shows that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extract before or after surgery or radiation does not improve overall survival or disease-free survival when compared with surgery or radiation alone (8842).\nless\nMelanoma. Subcutaneous European mistletoe extract does not seem to improve long-term survival rates in patients undergoing surgery for stage II or III melanoma. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA phase III clinical trial in patients with stage II or III melanoma undergoing surgical removal of lesions and positive lymph nodes shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador M) does not improve disease-free interval or overall survival over a period of 8 years when compared with observation alone (24780).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous or intravesical European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with bladder cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne small clinical study in patients who have had transurethral resection for superficial urothelial bladder carcinoma shows that intravesical administration of a specific European mistletoe extract 50 mL, containing mistletoe lectin 10 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL, weekly for 6 weeks might reduce bladder cancer recurrence rates at 12 months, with similar rates to those observed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy (15258). Also, a small retrospective chart review of patients with recurrent bladder cancer has found that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscucin Salicis, Wala Heilmittel GmbH) for several months might be associated with reduced tumor recurrence and an increased duration of tumor-free periods (93268).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with breast cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nObservational research in patients with solid tumors of the breast has found that subcutaneous administration of certain specific European mistletoe extracts (Iscador, Weleda; Helixor, Helixor Heilmittel GmbH & Co. KG) is associated with reduced tumor progression and improved survival when compared with a control (7045, 15351, 24798). However, these findings were not replicated in a randomized, controlled study. A small clinical trial in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy shows that subcutaneous injection of European mistletoe extracts (Helixor A, Iscador M Spez) three times weekly for 18 weeks does not reduce the rate of relapse or metastasis or improve quality of life when compared with chemotherapy alone (99497).\nless\nCancer. A meta-analysis of several small, low-quality clinical studies suggests that subcutaneous European mistletoe extract might improve quality of life in some patients with cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nSeveral small clinical studies have assessed the impact of various European mistletoe extracts (PS76A2, Helixor, Isorel, Eurixor, and AbnobaViscum Quercus), given subcutaneously either alone or with chemotherapy, on quality of life in patients with various types of cancer (24777, 24782, 24786, 24788, 24803, 24804, 93259, 93260, 93262, 93269). A meta-analysis of these and many other small clinical studies shows that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extract has a moderate effect on overall quality of life when compared with a control group, with significant improvements on various subdomains. A larger effect size is observed with more recent trials; however, this may be due to the inclusion of patients with less severe disease in more recent studies when compared with earlier studies (105839). The validity of these findings is limited by the high risk of bias of most of the included studies and the heterogeneity of the studies and patient populations.\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract improves fatigue in patients with cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA meta-analysis of 12 mostly small, unblinded randomized studies in 1525 patients with a variety of cancers shows that various European mistletoe extracts (e.g., Abnobaviscum, Eurixor, Helixor, Iscador, Lektinol) given subcutaneously at undefined doses modestly improves patient-reported fatigue scores when compared with placebo or usual care (110441). This report also describes a meta-analysis of 7 mostly large nonrandomized, retrospective studies in the same patient population. This analysis suggests that various European mistletoe extracts given subcutaneously may modestly improve clinician-reported fatigue when compared with usual care (110441). However, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials in patients with breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer shows European mistletoe extract given up to 20 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 3 to 52 weeks does not improve cancer-related fatigue when compared with control (111576). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low quality of the data and heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population and dose.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract can reduce the rate of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small clinical study in patients with gastric cancer recovering from surgery and receiving chemotherapy with doxifluridine shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Abnobaviscum Quercus, Abnoba GmbH) three times weekly for 24 weeks reduces the risk of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea by 86% when compared with doxifluridine alone (93262).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Several small, low-quality clinical and observational studies suggest that subcutaneous administration of specific European mistletoe extracts may improve survival or tumor response in patients with colorectal cancer when used as adjunct therapy. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne small clinical study in patients with solid tumors of the colon shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador, Weleda) increases survival time when compared with matched controls not receiving European mistletoe (7045). Another small clinical study in patients with advanced colorectal cancer shows that infusions of another specific European mistletoe extract (Isorel, Novipharm GmbH), in combination with chemotherapy and surgery, improves survival by at least 38% when compared with chemotherapy plus surgery or surgery alone (24783). Other small clinical studies in patients with colorectal cancer show that subcutaneous administration of another specific European mistletoe extract (Helixor, Helixor Heilmittel GmbH & Co. KG) 100-200 mg three times weekly, in addition to chemotherapy, nearly doubles survival over 2 years when compared with chemotherapy alone; however, between-group differences in tumor progression were not observed (24785, 24789). Additionally, a small observational study in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Abnobaviscum Quercus, Abnoba GmbH) 0.02 mg three times weekly for three weeks, and then slowly titrated up to 20 mg three times weekly for a total of 24 weeks, improves tumor response rates when compared with chemoradiotherapy alone (107285). Despite these promising results, much research in this field suffers from poor study design (10672).\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract can prevent the common cold. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador P or Iscador Qu, Weleda) twice weekly for 12 weeks does not reduce the frequency or duration of the common cold when compared with placebo (24806).\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral European mistletoe for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of European mistletoe for this purpose.\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with gastric cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne small clinical study in patients with solid tumors of the stomach shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador, Weleda) improves survival when compared with matched controls not receiving European mistletoe (7045). Another small clinical study in patients with gastric cancer recovering from surgery shows that subcutaneous administration of a different European mistletoe extract (Abnobaviscum Quercus, Abnoba GmbH) three times weekly for 24 weeks plus chemotherapy improves quality of life, increases total white blood cell and eosinophil counts, and reduces the risk of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea by 86% when compared with chemotherapy alone. However, there is no effect on lymphocyte responses (93262). Much research in this field suffers from poor study design (10672).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nWhile a small case series of patients with chronic hepatitis C has found that subcutaneous injection of a specific aqueous extract of European mistletoe (Iscador Qu, Weleda) may decrease viral load and improve quality of life (9770), a small observational study in patients with chronic hepatitis C has found that subcutaneous administration of a different European mistletoe product (Abnobaviscum Quercus, Abnoba GmbH) three times weekly for 6 months does not normalize viral load or liver enzymes, but is associated with improved disease-related symptoms, when compared to baseline (24805). The validity of the findings from these studies is limited by their retrospective nature and lack of a control group.\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral European mistletoe for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of European mistletoe for this purpose.\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if retroperitoneal instillation of European mistletoe extract is beneficial in kidney transplant patients with significant postoperative lymphatic drainage. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA large retrospective chart review in hospitalized kidney transplant patients with a large amount of postoperative lymphatic drainage suggests that retroperitoneal instillation of European mistletoe extract (Helixor M) 100 mg via the drainage tube may reduce drainage by about 83 mL from postoperative days 7 to 14 and decrease the length of hospitalization when compared with usual care (110442) The validity of these findings is limited by the retrospective study design.\nless\nLeukemia. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with leukemia. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Helixor) at doses up to 350 mg increases survival by up to 25.7 months when compared with survival times previously published in the scientific literature (24781). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a randomized comparator group.\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with lung cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nObservational research in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has found that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extracts (Abnobaviscum, Helixor, and Iscador) along with chemotherapy is associated with increased survival in patients with stage IV NSCLC, but not stage I-IIIA NSCLC, when compared with chemotherapy alone (99498, 105840). An additional observational study in adults with stage III or IV NSCLC suggests that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extracts (Abnobaviscum, Helixor, or Iscador) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors improves median survival rates when compared with checkpoint inhibitors alone (115490). However, a small, randomized clinical study in patients with NSCLC shows that treatment with a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador) does not significantly increase median survival time or tumor response when compared with placebo (24784, 24790).\nless\nMalignant pleural effusions. It is unclear if intrapleural European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with malignant pleural effusions. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small clinical study in patients with malignant pleural effusions shows that intrapleural administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Helixor M; Helixor Heilmittel GmbH & Co. KG) 100 mg, repeated every other day up to 5 times with doses increased by 100 mg with each successive procedure, increases response rate when compared with doxycycline. The response rate, defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete or partial response, was 91% with European mistletoe extract and 67% with doxycycline (24774). Another small clinical study in patients with lung cancer and malignant pleural effusions shows that intrapleural administration of this same European mistletoe extract and dosing regimen leads to a one-month pleural effusion recurrence rate of 48% (102547). The validity of this findings if limited by a lack of control group. Additionally, a retrospective observational study in patients with malignant pleural effusion suggests that intrapleural administration of European mistletoe extract does not reduce recurrence rates within 4 weeks when compared with intrapleural administration of large particle talc .However, patients receiving European mistletoe had lower total drainage and shorter duration of tube insertion when compared with those receiving talc (112992).\nless\nOsteosarcoma. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with osteosarcoma. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small, open-label clinical study in patients with complete surgical remission following a second osteosarcoma relapse shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador P), 3 times weekly for 12 months, improves post-relapse disease-free survival when compared with oral etoposide 50 mg/m2 daily for 21 days of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. After one year, 5 of 9 patients who completed treatment with European mistletoe extract had not relapsed, compared with 3 of 10 patients who completed etoposide therapy (105854). In a follow-up report, after a median of 83 months, disease-free survival remained the same in those receiving European mistletoe extract, whereas 0 of 10 patients remained disease-free after completion of etoposide treatment (105837).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with ovarian cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small observational study in patients with ovarian cancer has found that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador) along with conventional therapy is associated with improved survival by more than one year when compared with conventional therapy alone (93260).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous or intratumoral European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with pancreatic cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nSome observational research in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer has found that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extract is not associated with improved rates of partial or complete remission (3707, 8848). However, another observational study in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer being treated with chemotherapy and palliative surgical interventions has found that intratumoral administration of European mistletoe (Helixor, AbnobaViscum, and/or Iscucin) is associated with improved survival when compared with historical survival rates in patients receiving chemotherapy alone (93264). Additionally, a small, open-label clinical study in patients with stage III or IV pancreatic cancer who are no longer eligible for chemotherapy shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador Qu spezial) at doses starting at 0.01 mg and titrated up to 10 mg three times weekly for up to 12 months increases survival by about 2 months when compared with supportive care alone (93267).\nless\nRadiation exposure. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in children with radiation exposure. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small clinical study in children with recurrent respiratory infections due to exposure to ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident shows that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador) at doses ranging from 0.001 mg twice weekly to 1 ng/kg twice weekly for 5 weeks reduces the frequency of recurrent respiratory infections by 73% to 78% and improves symptoms such as fatigue, sweating, headache, joint pain, emotional instability, and muscle pain when compared to baseline (24779). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nUterine cancer. It is unclear if subcutaneous European mistletoe extract is beneficial in patients with uterine cancer. Oral European mistletoe has not been evaluated for this use.\nA small observational study in patients with uterine cancer has found that subcutaneous administration of a specific European mistletoe extract (Iscador) is associated with improved survival when compared with matched controls (24794).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate European mistletoe for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of European mistletoe.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of European mistletoe are the berries, leaf, and stem. European mistletoe is a parasitic plant that grows on several different trees, including pine, oak, apple, maple, and numerous others. The chemical composition of mistletoe preparations can vary depending on the tree it grows on, the time of harvest, and other factors (7039, 7106). Some active constituents found in certain varieties appear to be derived directly from the host tree (93270). European mistletoe has several active constituents, including the three main glycoprotein lectins: MLI, also known as viscumin, MLII, species of and MLIII; as well as viscotoxins, alkaloids, and monoterpene glucosides such as beta-amyrin acetate, oleanolic acid, betulinic acid, and phytosterols (7039, 8840, 8841, 8849, 9770, 93270). European mistletoe also contains a wide variety of phenolic acids, including protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, salicylic, ferulic, and sinapic acids (93270).\nAnticancer effects\nEuropean mistletoe is best known as a potential anticancer agent. Researchers think it might work as a biological response modifier that both stimulates the immune system and exerts cytotoxic effects (7039). There is evidence that European mistletoe can stimulate the immune system in both animal models and humans; including those with cancer (112993). It seems to cause leukocytosis, increasing the number and activity of B and T-helper lymphocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells (8843, 8844, 112993). European mistletoe also seems to increase white blood cell (WBC) secretion of cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (7039, 8843, 8844, 15349, 112993).\n\nRepeated administration appears to result in a desensitized immune response. Escalating European mistletoe doses are needed for continued stimulation of immune response (15349).\n\nAdditional evidence suggests European mistletoe might possess a DNA stabilizing effect, restricted primarily to the mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood in vitro (8844).\n\nIn vitro research indicates that European mistletoe can reduce secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from breast cancer cells (96491). There is also some evidence that European mistletoe can be cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and in animals, possibly by inhibiting cellular protein synthesis (8841, 8849, 96491). Some researchers think it might induce apoptosis in tumor cells (7039), which has been demonstrated in breast cancer cells in vitro. (96491). The toxicity appears to be specific to tumor cells, sparing normal lymphocytes (8845, 8846, 8847). The toxic glycoprotein lectin, viscumin, known also as ML-I seems to be primarily responsible for many of these immune stimulating and cytotoxic effects (8840, 8841, 8846, 8847, 8849, 112993). However, there is some evidence that viscotoxins and alkaloids might also play a role (7039, 8840, 112993). So far, evidence for cytotoxic or antitumor effects of these has been conflicting.\n\nThe gene for viscumin (ML-1) has been cloned, allowing production of the pure protein by recombinant DNA techniques. In this form, it is called aviscumine or r-viscumin. It is a 66 kiloDalton heterodimer with an A-chain which can cleave and inactivate ribosomal DNA, and a B-chain which binds to cell surface receptors, allowing uptake of the molecule into the cell (16385). Aviscumine induces apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells in vitro, it stimulates release of interleukins and interferons from keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and it increases the activity of human natural killer cells against lymphoma. In cell cultures it has activity against doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells and vindesine-resistant pleural mesothelioma cells, and it increases the cytotoxic effects of vincristine, idarubicin, and cisplatin against leukemia cells. It has activity in animals against urothelial, ovarian, and colon cancers (16385).\n\nAlthough European mistletoe does seem to affect the immune system in humans and possibly has cytotoxic effects, the clinical benefits in humans are unproven. A meta-analysis of clinical studies show that European mistletoe extract does not improve survival or rates of cancer recurrence in patients with a variety of cancers (112993). Researchers theorize that it might not work in humans for several reasons. Mistletoe lectins may not be able to bind to certain human cells. Human plasma proteins might interfere or break down active components of mistletoe; or humans may produce antibodies that destroy active constituents of mistletoe (7039). Preliminary studies with aviscumine in humans have reported limited and variable activity against various advanced solid tumors. There appears to be significant variation in the ability of aviscumine to bind to different tumor cell types, which may influence its activity (16385).\nAntidiabetes effects\nEuropean mistletoe may exhibit some antidiabetic activity. In animal research, European mistletoe extract caused a reduction in serum glucose levels and an increase in alpha-amylase activity in rats (93270).\nCardiovascular effects\nEuropean mistletoe might have hypotensive and cardiac depressant effects (11, 93270). Animal studies suggest that European mistletoe may relax vascular smooth muscle through calcium-channel blockade. Application of European mistletoe extract to aortic tissue inhibits contractions induced by both phenylephrine and potassium (96492).\nGastrointestinal effects\nEuropean mistletoe might have antispasmodic activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Animal research shows that European mistletoe extract relaxes intestinal tissue through calcium-channel blockade. Application of the extract to jejunal tissue inhibits spontaneous and potassium-induced contractions (96492).\nHepatotoxic effects\nThere is some concern that European mistletoe can adversely affect the liver; however, the mechanism of mistletoe-induced liver injury is unclear. Beta-phenylethylamine, acetylcholine, tyramine, and propionylcholine are potential hepatotoxic constituents found in European mistletoe which may be responsible for these adverse effects (3932, 88777).\nImmunologic effects\nThe effect of European mistletoe on the human immune system is unclear. European mistletoe has demonstrated immunostimulant effects in vitro (8843, 8844) and in vivo in subjects exposed to radiation (24775, 24779). However, other clinical research in adults with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer shows that subcutaneous administration of European mistletoe extract 2-3 times weekly results in modest downregulation of PHA-activated T lymphocytes (96476). Additionally, observational and clinical research suggests that there is no increased risk for side effects when European mistletoe extract is administered in conjunction with targeted therapies such as the monoclonal antibodies atezolizumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab (96489, 96490, 96491, 112991).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nEuropean mistletoe might have sedative effects (11).\nPulmonary effects\nA small retrospective observational study in elderly patients with lung disease and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax refractory to chest tube insertion and not amenable to bullectomy suggests that intrapleural instillation of European mistletoe extract may produce successful chemical pleurodesis by inducing pleural inflammation (105838)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of European silver fir are the oil extracted from the needles; the branch tips and fresh shoots; and the wood and bark (18, 102015, 110889, 110890). European silver fir contains polyphenols, monoterpenes, and lignans (pinoresinol diglucoside, isolariciresinol, and secolariciresinol) (102014, 102015). It also contains bornyl acetate, limonene, camphene, alpha pinene, beta-pinene, beta-phellandrene, delta-carene, myrcene, santene, gallic acid, protocatehuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid (18, 102015).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEuropean silver fir is of interest for its anti-inflammatory effects. Specific European silver fir extracts (Abigenol, Belinal) have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro (110889, 110890).\nAntihyperglycemic effects\nExtracts of European silver fir wood and bark contain inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes, which could reduce intestinal breakdown of sugars into monosaccharides and reduce blood glucose levels. Lignans present in the extracts inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4, increasing incretin levels and potentially reducing blood glucose levels. European silver fir extracts also protect cultured mouse myoblast cells against the oxidative effects of high glucose levels (102015). In healthy adults, taking an extract of European silver fir modestly reduces post-prandial glucose levels (110891).\nAntimicrobial effects\nEuropean silver fir essential oil may have antimicrobial effects, possibly due to monoterpene constituents. A mixture of European silver fir and lemon oils, diluted in water and nebulized for 30 minutes with an ultrasonic nebulizer, reduces microbial concentrations in a hospital room. Airborne bacteria counts are reduced by 40% and airborne fungal counts by 30% to 60% (102014)."

There are some concerns about the safety of Eurycoma longifolia due to contamination with mercury and lead or adulteration with sildenafil (17925, 17926, 17927, 18137, 49087, 93494). Some research shows that 36% and 17% of Eurycoma longifolia preparations from Malaysia contain high levels of mercury and lead, respectively (17925, 17926, 17927, 49087). While safety issues related to these contaminants have not been reported in humans, taking high doses of Eurycoma longifolia long-term might cause symptoms of heavy metal poisoning or sildenafil-related adverse effects.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Eurycoma longifolia include the root, root bark, stem, leaves, and bark. The primary active constituents are the quassinoids including longilactone, dehydrolongilactone, 11-dehydroklaineanone, eurycomanone, eurycomanol, and others (13225, 13234, 93493). The quassinoids give Eurycoma longifolia its bitter taste (13234, 93493). Other constituents include squalene derivatives, biphenylneolignans, tirucallane-type triterpenes, anthraquinones, dimeric dihydrobenzofuran, and canthin-6-one and beta-carboline alkaloids (13227, 93493, 103619). Specific polypeptides, called eurypeptides, have also been identified in Eurycoma longifolia (17924).\nAntiandrogenic effects\nA study in rats shows that oral Eurycoma longifolia extract administered daily for 4 weeks inhibits the development of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) when compared with control (112181). In vitro data suggests Eurycoma longifolia has activity against BPH-1 cells; quassinoids were identified as relevant active constituents (112181).\nAntibacterial effects\nAntibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria (except E. coli and Salmonella typhi) has been shown for Eurycoma longifolia in vitro (18137, 49103). It appears that extracts of the leaves and stem have antibacterial effects whereas the root extract does not (93493).\nAnticancer effects\nAlkaloids, quassinoids, and other compounds from Eurycoma longifolia have shown in vitro activity against breast, colon, fibrosarcoma, lung, cervical, and melanoma cancer cells (13225, 18137, 18140, 93493). The anticancer effects of Eurycoma longifolia may be related to stimulation of apoptosis (49096, 49104, 93493).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a rat model, Eurycoma longifolia extract was found to decrease glucose levels in hyperglycemic rats but not in normoglycemic rats (18137, 49093). The root extract potentially increases insulin sensitivity and enhances glucose uptake (93493).\nAntimalarial effects\nEurycoma longifolia is traditionally used for malaria. Extracts have in vitro activity against strains of malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum. This activity is attributable to several quassinoids. However, it is likely that there is synergy between the quassinoids when taken together in the extract (13225, 13232, 18137, 18140, 93493).\nAntischistosomal effects\nQuassinoid constituents of Eurycoma longifolia seem to have antischistosomal activity (13225, 18140).\nAntiulcer effects\nEurycoma longifolia is traditionally used for peptic ulcers. In animal research, Eurycoma longifolia is as effective as ranitidine. The quassinoids likely play a role (93493).\nAnxiolytic effects\nExtracts of Eurycoma longifolia seem to have an anxiolytic effect in animal models, with similar efficacy to diazepam (13231, 93493). In humans, the extract reduces levels of cortisol and improves mood during stress (93497).\nBone effects\nEurycoma longifolia is of interest for osteoporosis associated with androgen deficiency in males. In laboratory research, Eurycoma longifolia extract increases the activity of osteoblasts, promoting proliferation and calcium deposition (93495). In an animal model, Eurycoma longifolia maintains bone calcium levels following removal of testicles (49113). The bone effects of Eurycoma longifolia are likely related to its promotion of nitric oxide and effects on hormones. Increased testosterone is thought to inhibit bone resorption following use of Eurycoma longifolia. Nitric oxide is thought to promote bone formation (93487, 93493).\nFertility effects\nExtracts of Eurycoma longifolia seem to stimulate libido, sexual drive, and sexual activities in animal models (13224, 13228, 13229, 13230, 13233, 18137, 18139, 18142, 93487). Some research in animals suggests that Eurycoma longifolia has an androgenic effect. Extracts of Eurycoma longifolia seem to stimulate growth of the levator ani muscle (13227). Some research on estrogen-treated rats suggests that Eurycoma longifolia can increase sperm counts and activity and spermatogenesis (18139, 93493). There is less research in humans. However, Eurycoma longifolia has been shown to increase sperm motility (18138, 93493).\nHormonal effects\nSpecific polypeptides called eurypeptides, identified in Eurycoma longifolia, are thought to have aphrodisiac effects by increasing the body's synthesis of androgens, including testosterone (17924). These peptides are thought to activate 17-alpha-hydroxylase / 17,20-lyase, resulting in increased metabolism of pregnenolone and 17-OH-pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and metabolism of progesterone and 17-OH-progesterone to 4-androstenedione and testosterone (93487, 93493).\n\nElevated testosterone levels have been found in Eurycoma longifolia treated rats (18142, 93493).\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that testosterone levels may also be increased in humans, especially when baseline levels are lower than normal (17924, 93493, 93497, 97312, 108451, 112185). A clinical study in aging males with testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL shows that taking a specific water extract of Eurycoma longifolia roots (Physta; Biotropics Malaysia) 100-200 mg daily with breakfast for 12 weeks increases total testosterone levels when compared with placebo. Although DHEA levels increased when compared with baseline, this change was not significant when compared with placebo (108451). However, taking Eurycoma longifolia extract 200-400 mg daily for 6-8 weeks does not appear to alter the urinary testosterone: epitestosterone ratio (93486, 103619). Research in males with normal testosterone levels shows that Eurycoma longifolia 300 mg daily does not seem to alter testosterone levels (93490), while a higher dose of 600 mg daily seems to modestly increase testosterone levels when compared with placebo (105084).\n\nCertain chemicals in Eurycoma longifolia also appear to have anti-estrogenic effects in animal models (49111, 93493). In male rats, a quassinoid-rich methanolic extract of Eurycoma longifolia increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels while decreasing estrogen levels (93487). A clinical study in healthy males shows that although taking a water extract of Eurycoma longifolia 600 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly increased estrogen levels when compared with placebo, it did not affect LH or FSH levels (105084).\nImmune effects\nIn human research, Eurycoma longifolia extract 200 mg/day for 4 weeks increases immunological vigor based on levels and activity of B cells and T cells (93488).\nMuscular effects\nIn a low testosterone animal model, Eurycoma longifolia extract increases weight of the levator ani muscle involved in tail wagging. This benefit does not occur in animals with normal testosterone levels (13227). In humans, Eurycoma longifolia increases muscular strength (49134, 97312).\nWeight loss effects\nA clinical study in adults with obesity shows that taking a specific oral product (CitruSlim; NHR Science) containing Eurycoma longifolia root extract 17% and bergamot extract 83% 200-400 mg daily does not affect levels of salivary cortisol, leptin, or ghrelin, or adiponectin/leptin ratios, when compared with placebo (108452)."

            "Overview": "Evening primrose is a biennial plant native to North and South America and widespread throughout Europe and parts of Asia (49240). In North America, the plant blooms from June to September and has yellow flowers that open at sunset and close during the day (49226). The leaves can be cooked and eaten as greens; the roots can be boiled like potatoes (49226). Oil obtained from the seeds is rich in omega-6 essential fatty acids, including gamma linolenic acid (GLA) (49240). Traditionally, evening primrose oil is used for alcohol use disorder.",
            "Warnings": "In 2002, the UK Medicines Control Agency withdrew prescription drug product licenses for two evening primrose products, Epogam and Efamast. These were originally licensed for atopic eczema and mastalgia, respectively. The Agency concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the current standards for efficacy required for prescription products (9882).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Evening primrose oil has been used safely in doses up to 6 grams daily for up to 1 year (7566, 7567, 8926, 12036, 20512, 49286, 49360, 109426, 114807, 114809).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of evening primrose oil when used topically. There is also insufficient reliable information available about the safety of evening primrose seed, flower, or leaf when used orally or topically.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when evening primrose oil is used orally and appropriately, short-term. In children up to 5 years of age, doses of evening primrose oil up to 3 grams daily have been used safely for 5 months (20512, 49273), and 0.5 grams/kg daily has been used safely for 8 weeks (7570). In children up to 12 years of age, doses of 4-6 grams daily have been used safely for 3-5 months (7565, 7566, 20512, 49286). ...when used topically and appropriately, short-term. In children 2-10 years of age, evening primrose oil has been applied to affected areas of the skin twice daily for up to 3 months (96718). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of evening primrose seed, flower, or leaf when used orally or topically.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when evening primrose oil is used orally and appropriately. In small studies of evening primrose oil for pre-eclampsia, 4 grams has been used orally daily for up to 10 weeks during pregnancy with apparent safety (1409, 20525). ...when evening primrose oil is used orally or intravaginally to improve cervical ripening. Evening primrose oil has been used safely during the last 1-3 weeks of pregnancy to improve cervical ripening (20524, 96717, 112130, 112131, 114810). Intravaginally, evening primrose oil 500-1000 mg as either a single dose or administered daily starting at week 38 until pregnancy has been used with apparent safety for this purpose (112130, 112131). Orally, evening primrose oil 1500-4500 mg in divided doses daily for 1-3 weeks has been used with apparent safety for this purpose, although one study found 5 cases of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (112131). Some studies report that improvement was lacking and there was a trend toward prolonged labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, increased rates of arrest of descent, and increased oxytocin requirements (1411, 112131). Intravaginally, evening primrose oil, 1000 mg every 4 hours up to 5 times or 2000 mg as a single dose, has been used as an adjunct to misoprostol for a medication abortion with apparent safety for this purpose (114806, 114808). Evening primrose oil has also been linked to a case report of petechiae and ecchymoses in a newborn infant whose mother took a total of 6.5 grams during the week before giving birth (16303); use with caution, especially in high doses.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when evening primrose oil is used orally. Supplementation with evening primrose oil during lactation results in the secretion of high levels of the constituent gamma linolenic acid into breast milk (1982); however, this fatty acid is normally present in significant amounts in breast milk (11884).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, evening primrose oil is generally well tolerated. There is limited reliable information available regarding the safety or adverse effects of other parts of the plant.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting.\nDermatologic\nOrally, use of evening primrose oil has been associated with reports of skin rash and acne (9156, 9794, 49338). There is a case report of extensive but transient petechiae and purpuric ecchymoses in a newborn infant whose mother had consumed raspberry leaf tea and a total of 6.5 grams of evening primrose oil orally and vaginally during the week prior to delivery. The infant had a normal platelet count and no signs of hemorrhage, and was discharged healthy at 3 days of age (16303).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal complaints, including abdominal pain, distension and fullness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and flatulence are the most common adverse effects of evening primrose (8926, 9794, 20533, 49188, 49286, 49339, 49365, 65864, 88184, 102556). Often these effects resolve with continued use. Altered taste has also been reported (49339).\nless\nHematologic\nThere is preliminary clinical evidence that evening primrose oil can decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. In a small study of patients with hyperlipidemia, taking evening primrose oil 3 grams daily for 4 months was associated with a 40% increase in bleeding time, and decreases in ADP- and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation of 50% and 60% respectively (1979). There is also a case report of diffuse ecchymoses and petechiae in a neonate whose mother had consumed 6.5 grams of evening primrose oil over the week prior to delivery (16303).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nCases of dizziness (9794) and headache (88184) have been reported with evening primrose oil when used orally.\n\nThere is a report of seizures in a patient taking evening primrose oil and receiving anesthesia; however, the patient was also taking other drugs and it is therefore unclear if evening primrose was the cause (613). There is also concern that evening primrose oil might cause seizures, or lower the seizure threshold, in patients with schizophrenia who are treated with phenothiazines. This is based on limited data from two studies published in the 1980s. In one report, three patients with schizophrenia who had received phenothiazines developed EEG changes suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy after starting treatment with evening primrose, although none experienced an actual seizure (21013). In the other report, two patients with schizophrenia who were stabilized on phenothiazines developed seizures when evening primrose oil 4 grams daily was added. One of these patients had a prior history of seizures (21010). There is no evidence that evening primrose taken alone, without medications known to lower the seizure threshold, can cause seizures (88187).\nless\nOther\nWeight gain has been reported in individuals receiving evening primrose oil (49338).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAsthma. Oral evening primrose oil does not seem to be effective for asthma treatment.\nSeveral small clinical trials show that taking evening primrose oil 15-20 mL or 4-6 grams daily in divided doses for 8-16 weeks does not improve symptoms of asthma when compared with placebo (7565, 20545, 20546).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nMastalgia. Most clinical research in patients with mastalgia shows that oral evening primrose oil does not seem to reduce pain. However, research results are conflicting.\nAlthough some low-quality studies have suggested that evening primrose oil 1-4 grams daily for 3-6 months can reduce breast pain (9794, 20519, 20520, 49303, 49339, 88182, 104140), higher quality clinical research shows that taking evening primrose oil 3-4 grams in 2-3 divided doses daily for 6-12 months only decreases breast pain when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (9156, 20518, 49212, 49338, 49357). A meta-analysis of these and other randomized clinical trials also shows that taking evening primrose oil 1-4 grams daily for 2-12 months does not reduce pain severity when compared with placebo. One subgroup analysis suggests that taking evening primrose oil may reduce pain scores when compared with topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, the validity of this result is limited by a small sample size and high heterogeneity (96713, 96716, 109426). In contrast, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with cyclical mastalgia shows that taking evening primrose oil 1000 mg twice daily, with or without vitamin E 400 mg once daily, for 6 months reduces breast pain severity when compared with placebo. Taking evening primrose oil and vitamin E together reduces pain severity more effectively than either ingredient alone (114809). However, it is unclear if the reduction in pain scores is clinically significant.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbortion. Although there has been interest in using intravaginal administration of evening primrose oil for abortion, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose oil for this purpose. Oral evening primrose oil has not been evaluated for this use.\nOne moderate-sized clinical study in patients in Iran undergoing abortion for intrauterine fetal death shows that intravaginal administration of evening primrose oil 1000 mg, in combination with misoprostol, every 4 hours up to 5 times reduces the mean induction-to-fetal-expulsion interval, pain intensity, and the average dose of misoprostol required when compared with misoprostol alone. Another moderate-sized clinical study in patients undergoing abortion for intrauterine fetal death shows that intravaginal administration of evening primrose oil 2000 mg the night before hospitalization, followed by misoprostol upon hospital admission, reduces the mean induction-to-fetal-expulsion time when compared with misoprostol alone (114806, 114808).\nless\nAcne. Although there has been interest in using oral or topical evening primrose oil for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for adults or children with atopic dermatitis; the available research is conflicting.\nThe majority of studies have used the specific evening primrose oil products Epogam (Scotia Pharmaceuticals), Efamol (Efamol Ltd.), or Efamol Marine (Efamol Ltd.). Some small studies in adults show that taking evening primrose oil 2-3 grams orally twice daily for 3 weeks to 5 months modestly reduces the extent of atopic dermatitis, itching, and dryness (7569, 20512, 20515, 21019, 49288); however, other small studies using evening primrose oil 6-8 grams daily for 3-4 months did not show any difference when compared with baseline or placebo (7566, 7567, 49286). A meta-analysis of these and other low-quality clinical trials in adults and children shows that taking oral evening primrose 0.5-6 grams daily for 2 to 5 months does not improve atopic dermatitis scores when compared with placebo (115750). Furthermore, using a combination of evening primrose oil 2.58 grams and fish oil 0.642 grams (Efamol Marine, Efamol Ltd.) orally twice daily for 16 weeks is associated with worsening of erythema and skin cracking when compared with placebo (7566).\n\nIn children 2 to 18 years of age, some small clinical studies show that taking evening primrose oil orally in age-dependent doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 2 weeks to 5 months reduces the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis, and improves symptoms such as itching, dryness, and pruritus, when compared with placebo (7568, 20512, 21019, 49188, 49273, 49288). However, other small studies show that taking evening primrose oil (Epogam or Efamol) 2-4 grams daily for 3-4 months does not improve atopic dermatitis when compared with placebo (7565, 49285, 49286). A meta-analysis of these and other low-quality clinical trials in adults and children shows that taking oral evening primrose 0.5-6 grams daily for 2 to 5 months does not improve atopic dermatitis scores when compared with placebo (115750).\n\nThe differing findings may be due to the small size and methodological weaknesses of the available studies. Also, conflicting results may be due to differences in the severity of atopic dermatitis at baseline, the length of time since diagnosis, or the dose of evening primrose oil used.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some small clinical studies suggest that oral evening primrose oil is not beneficial in children with ADHD.\nTwo small clinical studies in children with ADHD show that taking 3 or 4 capsules of a specific product containing evening primrose oil (Efamol) twice daily for 4 weeks, does not improve ADHD symptoms when compared with placebo (6443, 6462). However, some clinical research in children and adolescents shows that taking 3 capsules of a specific product (Eye Q, Equazen / Novasel) containing evening primrose oil 100 mg/capsule and fish oil 400 mg/capsule twice daily for 12-15 weeks has positive effects on some symptoms of ADHD, such as inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and restlessness/impulsivity, when compared with placebo (15739, 65864). However it is unclear if any benefit is due to evening primrose oil, fish oil, or the combination.\nless\nBiliary disorders. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with biliary disorders.\nOne preliminary clinical trial shows that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Scotia Pharmaceuticals) 2 grams orally twice daily for 12 weeks might improve pruritus in some patients with biliary cirrhosis. In responders, clinical improvement seems to occur within 1-2 weeks of starting treatment, but relapse occurs within 1-2 weeks after treatment discontinuation (49337).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with CFS.\nOne preliminary clinical trial shows that taking two 500 mg capsules of a specific product (Efamol Marine, Scotia Pharmaceuticals) containing evening primrose oil plus fish oil four times daily for 3 months improves total symptom scores in 85% of people with symptoms of CFS after a viral infection, compared with 17% of those receiving placebo (7563). However, a later clinical trial using the same regimen in people with a confirmed diagnosis of CFS shows that taking this product does not significantly reduce symptoms of CFS when compared with placebo (7564). The product used in these two trials (Efamol Marine, Scotia Pharmaceutical) is standardized to contain gamma linolenic acid (GLA) 36 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 17 mg, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 11 mg, and linoleic acid 255 mg per capsule.\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for CHD prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this purpose.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in children with DCD shows that taking a tuna fish oil product providing DHA 480 mg daily for 4 months, in combination with evening primrose oil providing arachidonic acid 35 mg and gamma linolenic acid 96 mg, thyme oil 24 mg, and vitamin E 80 mg (Efalex, Efamol Ltd.), modestly decreases movement disorders as determined by objective measures when compared with baseline (5708). It is unclear if these benefits are due to evening primrose oil, other ingredients, or the combination. Also, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with gestational diabetes and low vitamin D levels, clinical research shows that taking a capsule containing evening primrose oil 1000 mg and vitamin D 1000 IU daily for 6 weeks reduces fasting plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels, reduces insulin resistance, and improves beta cell function when compared with placebo. Taking evening primrose oil and vitamin D also results in a reduction in triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (96719). It is not clear if these effects are due to evening primrose oil, vitamin D, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nOne clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil standardized to contain gamma linolenic acid 480 mg once daily for 12 months does not improve measures of vibration perception or measures of autonomic nervous system function, such as postural hypotension and cardiac rhythm changes induced by deep breathing or the Valsalva maneuver, in people with painful diabetic neuropathy (49360). However, other clinical research shows that taking evening primrose oil providing gamma linolenic acid 360-480 mg daily for 6-12 months improves measures of nerve conduction velocity, muscle and nerve action potential amplitudes, reflexes, and temperature sensation in patients with mild diabetic neuropathy (8926, 20528). Reasons for the discrepancies are not entirely clear, but may be due to the severity of diabetic neuropathy at baseline.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with dry eye.\nPreliminary clinicical research shows that taking a specific evening primrose oil product (Qarma, Equazen) 3 grams daily for 6 months improves some symptoms of dry eye associated with soft contact lens use when compared with placebo (20531).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with dry skin.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults treated with isotretinoin for acne vulgaris shows that taking evening primrose oil 510 mg orally daily for 9 months improves skin moisture scores when compared with no intervention (109430).\nless\nDyslexia. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in children with dyslexia shows that taking an evening primrose oil product providing arachidonic acid 35 mg and gamma linolenic acid 96 mg daily in combination with a tuna fish oil product providing DHA 480 mg daily (Efalex, Efamol Ltd.) for 5 months modestly improves subjective measures of reading speed and motoric-perceptual velocity when compared to baseline in children with dyslexia (20530). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nEndometriosis. Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for endometriosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nHepatitis B. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with hepatitis B.\nThere is preliminary clinical evidence that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Scotia Pharmaceuticals) 2 grams twice daily for 12 months is no more effective than placebo for improving liver function tests or liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis B infection (20548).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for improving lipid levels.\nA meta-analysis of six low-quality clinical studies in patients with or without hyperlipidemia shows that taking evening primrose oil for 6-17 weeks does not reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides, nor does it increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with placebo (104139). However, only one of the studies in the analysis specifically evaluated patients with hyperlipidemia. Other preliminary clinical research in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking evening primrose oil 3-4 grams daily orally in two divided doses for 1-3 months can decrease total cholesterol by 15% to 18% and triglycerides by 13% to 24%, as well as increase HDL cholesterol by 16%, when compared to baseline (20533, 20534). However, other preliminary clinical research in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking evening primrose oil 2.2-6.6 grams daily orally for 3 months does not improve cholesterol levels when compared to baseline (20523).\n\nOther clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing evening primrose oil 250 mg along with policosanol, tomato extract, and grape seed procyanidins (CholActive, Indena S.p.A.) twice daily for 6 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 13% and LDL cholesterol by 17% when compared with placebo in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (20536). It is unclear if these effects are due to evening primrose oil, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHysteroscopy. It is unclear if intravaginal evening primrose oil is beneficial for cervical ripening prior to hysteroscopy. Oral evening primrose oil has not been evaluated for this use.\nA large clinical study of females in Iran shows that inserting evening primrose oil 1000 mg intravaginally once 6 hours prior to hysteroscopy reduces the need for mechanical dilation, limits the time to completion of dilation, and improves the ease of dilation, without increasing complications (i.e. cervical or uterine rupture), when compared with placebo (110571). The interpretation of these results is limited by lack of comparison with standard therapy (i.e. misoprostol). Another small clinical study in adults undergoing gynecological procedures including hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage shows that inserting intravaginal evening primrose oil 2000 mg one time 2 hours prior to the procedure increases cervical dilation by about 2 mm and reduces pain but does not reduce vaginal bleeding, vomiting, or uterine cramps when compared with misoprostol as an active control (112129).\nless\nIchthyosis. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with ichthyosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking evening primrose oil orally, 3 grams daily for adults or 2 grams daily for children 12 years and under, for 9 weeks does not improve symptoms of ichthyosis vulgaris when compared to baseline (20537).\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for infant development.\nThere is preliminary clinical evidence that adding evening primrose oil and fish oil to newborn infant formulas might produce plasma and blood cell levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are closer to those of breastfed infants than standard formula (20549, 49174). In one study this was associated with improved visual acuity in infants at 16 and 30 weeks of age when compared with standard formula, but not when compared with breast milk (20549).\nless\nIntermittent claudication. Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for intermittent claudication, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for IBS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with liver cancer.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil orally, 18 grams daily, does not affect liver size, average survival, or subjective feelings of well-being in patients with primary liver cancer when compared with placebo (1983). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms. Clinical research results are conflicting.\nTwo small clinical trials in patients with menopause who were not currently receiving hormone therapy shows that taking evening primrose oil 1-2 grams orally daily for 2-8 weeks reduces psychological symptoms, such as depressive moods, irritability, mental exhaustion, and anxiety, by 45% to 73% when compared with baseline. These changes were statistically significant when compared with placebo (102556, 109427). However, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with menopause and not receiving hormone therapy shows that taking evening primrose oil 1 gram twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve overall symptom of menopause when compared with placebo (114807).\n\nEvening primrose oil has also been evaluated for reducing hot flashes, with mixed findings. Small clinical trials in patients with menopause show that taking evening primrose oil 1-4 grams daily for 1.5-6 months does not reduce the frequency of hot flashes when compared with placebo (274, 88184, 109428). However, one small clinical trial shows that taking evening primrose oil does moderately reduce the frequency and severity of night sweats and hot flashes when compared with placebo (109428).\n\nEvening primrose has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial shows that taking one capsule daily of a combination of evening primrose oil with soy isoflavones, black cohosh, and Vitex agnus-castus (Estosalus, Max Biocare Pty Ltd) for 12 weeks moderately reduces the severity of hot flushes, sweating, sleep problems, depressed mood, and irritability when compared with placebo. There was no effect on plasma lipids, joint discomfort, heart discomfort, anxiety, exhaustion, or sexual problems (105102). Another preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a combination product providing evening primrose oil 440-880 mg daily with isoflavones and vitamin E for 6 months induces 57% to 63% reductions in subjective menopausal symptoms when compared with baseline (21002). It is unclear if these effects are due to evening primrose, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for patients with MS; some research suggests that evening primrose oil may actually worsen MS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a specific evening primrose oil product (Naudicelle, Bio Oil Research Ltd.), 8 capsules daily for 2 years, increases the number of patients with acute remitting MS who deteriorate when compared with placebo (49364). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking a combination of evening primrose oil 0.6-0.7 grams and hempseed oil three times daily for 6 months reduces disability scores and relapse rate when compared to baseline (88183). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these benefits are due to evening primrose oil, hemp seed oil, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for individuals with obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking evening primrose orally, 1200 mg four times daily for 12 weeks, does not improve weight loss in individuals with obesity on a reduced calorie diet when compared with a reduced calorie diet alone (20540).\nless\nOsteopenia. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of evening primrose oil 4 grams, fish oil 440 mg, and calcium 1 gram (Efacal, Scotia Pharmaceuticals) orally in divided doses daily for 12 months does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with calcium alone in healthy pre- and post-menopausal females whose baseline BMD is within 2 standard deviations of normal (21001).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nParturition. Most clinical studies in term or late term pregnant adults show that oral and intravaginal evening primrose oil increases cervical ripening and may reduce the duration of labor and need for cesarean section. However, research on other pregnancy-related outcomes is unclear.\nMeta-analyses of small to moderate-sized, low-quality clinical trials in healthy term pregnancies show that taking oral or intravaginal evening primrose oil 500-4500 mg daily beginning as early as 37 weeks gestation for 7-10 days or until birth, or as a single dose at either 37 weeks or 6 hours prior to labor induction, decreases the, duration of labor, and the odds of cesarean section by up to 39%, but does not affect the length of the second stage of labor, the need for oxytocin, the duration of oxytocin use, or neonatal weight when compared with placebo. Evidence is conflicting on whether evening primrose oil improves Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. (20524, 96717, 109028, 109029, 112130, 112131, 114810).\n\nOne meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies shows that oral or intravaginal evening primrose oil improves cervical ripening (112131). Additionally, another moderate-sized clinical study in nulliparous late-term pregnant adults shows that intravaginal administration of evening primrose oil pearls 1000 mg repeated every 6 hours in the absence of a treatment response up to a maximum of 4 times increases cervical readiness when compared with active control misoprostol (112130). Similarly, a small clinical study in low-risk, term pregnant adults shows that intravaginal evening primrose oil 1000 mg daily improves cervical ripening when compared with placebo (114810).\n\nOne small, older observational study suggests that taking evening primrose oil from week 37 of pregnancy until delivery is not associated with improvements in cervical ripening or the duration of gestation, and might be associated with a trend toward prolonged labor and increased oxytocin requirements, in low-risk pregnancies (1411).\n\nStudies utilized evening primrose oil either orally as 1000-4500 mg daily for 7-14 days, or vaginally as 1000-3000 mg daily for 1-14 days, but subgroup analyses did not identify the most effective regimen. Overall, the validity of these studies is limited by high heterogeneity (20524, 96717, 109028, 109029).Additionally, most clinical studies were conducted in the Middle East which may limit generalizability of results (109028, 109029, 112131).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral evening primrose oil for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of evening primrose for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with PCOS and low vitamin D levels shows that taking a capsule containing evening primrose oil 1000 mg and vitamin D 1000 IU daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels and improves some markers of oxidative stress when compared with placebo. However, there is no change in the clinical features of PCOS, including hirsutism, acne, and alopecia (96720). An expression of concern has been published related to the integrity of this publication. Until more is known, interpret the information related to these findings with caution (104685).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for postoperative pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing an appendectomy shows that taking a specific evening primrose oil (Natural Life) postoperatively, 1000 mg every 30 minutes for 3 doses, reduces pain scores by 50% when compared with baseline. Subjects taking a placebo did not show a reduction in pain scores from baseline; however, a between-group statistical comparison was not conducted (109429).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of pre-eclampsia.\nSome very small clinical studies show that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Efamed Ltd.) 4 grams daily or a specific product (Preglandin), providing linoleic acid 375 mg and gamma linolenic acid 45 mg daily, does not reduce blood pressure, proteinuria, or rate of edema in patients with pre-eclampsia (1409, 20525). Another very small clinical study shows that taking 8 capsules containing evening primrose plus fish oil, standardized to contain gamma linolenic acid 37 mg/capsule, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 18 mg/capsule, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 10 mg/capsule, daily for 6 months during pregnancy reduces the incidence of edema by 32%, but does not reduce the risk of hypertension, when compared with placebo (1042).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with PMS.\nTwo small clinical studies show that taking a specific evening primrose oil product (Efamol, Efamol Ltd.) orally, either 4 grams daily for 3 months or 3 grams daily from day 15 to the end of the menstrual cycle for 4 cycles, improves subjective symptoms of PMS when compared with placebo (21005, 49335). However, other clinical research shows that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Efamol Ltd.) 3-6 grams daily for 2-4 menstrual cycles is not beneficial when compared with placebo (1106, 21004, 49323).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTwo small, preliminary clinical trials in patients with chronic stable plaque psoriasis shows that taking a combination of evening primrose oil 4.32-5.16 grams plus fish oil 1.072-1.284 grams orally in two divided doses daily for 6-7 months does not reduce the severity of psoriasis or prolong remission when compared with placebo (21006, 21007).\nless\nPsoriatic arthritis. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with psoriatic arthritis shows that taking 12 capsules of a specific product (Efamol Marine, Scotia Pharmaceuticals) providing 0.4 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus gamma linolenic acid 0.5 grams daily for 9 months does not improve skin or joint symptoms when compared with placebo (20544).\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Raynaud syndrome shows that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Efamol Ltd.) 6 grams daily for 10 weeks improves the frequency and duration of attacks of digital ischemia based on subjective measures. However, it does not improve objective measurements of finger temperature and cold-induced vasospasm (49365).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with RA.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil 6 grams daily for 12 months improves subjective, but not objective, symptoms of RA when compared with placebo (12036). Another small clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil 6 grams daily for 6 weeks does not reduce morning stiffness or joint tenderness when compared to baseline in RA patients (20542).\n\nEvening primrose oil has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil (Natural Wealth) 2.6 grams daily with a fish oil product (Omega-3 Cardio, Natural Wealth) 2 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces total symptom scores, pain severity, and the number of painful joints when compared with placebo, but not when compared with taking the same fish oil product (Omega-3 Cardio, Natural Wealth) 5 grams daily without evening primrose oil (96714). Other preliminary clinical research shows that using evening primrose oil 10 mL orally twice daily for 12 weeks, or a combination of evening primrose oil plus a vitamin supplement containing vitamin C, niacin, pyridoxine, and zinc sulfate (Efavite, Efamol) daily for 12 weeks, does not improve objective symptoms of RA (12035, 20543).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol) 6 grams daily for 16 weeks induces psychological and memory improvements based on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale in patients with schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia (21009). However, taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Efamol Ltd.) 4 grams daily along with a supplement (Efavite, Efamol Ltd.) containing vitamin E 40 mg, vitamin C 1000 mg, vitamin B6 200 mg, vitamin B3 200 mg, and zinc sulfate 40 mg daily for 2-4 months does not improve scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the MACC Behavioral Adjustment Scale in patients hospitalized with chronic, severe schizophrenia (21010).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that taking evening primrose oil (Efamol, Primrose Research Inc.) orally, either alone or combined with vitamin C and vitamin B6 for 8-10 weeks does not improve ocular or oral symptoms associated with Sjogren syndrome when compared with baseline or placebo (12037, 12038).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. It is unclear if oral evening primrose oil is beneficial in patients with tardive dyskinesia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking evening primrose oil 6 grams daily for 6-16 weeks does not improve neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia (21009, 49271).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral evening primrose oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking a combination of evening primrose oil and borage oil orally, 3 grams daily for one month then 1.5 grams daily for 5 months, improves stool consistency, but does not have an effect on rectal bleeding, stool frequency, disease relapse, or rectal histology when compared with placebo (1037).\nless\nWater warts. It is unclear if topical evening primrose oil improves the resolution of water warts in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 2-10 years of age shows that applying evening primrose oil to water wart lesions twice daily for 3 months produces complete resolution of lesions within 3 months in about 29% of children. The known natural course of the infection involves spontaneous resolution in only about 4% to 7% of children at 3 months and 58% of children at 12 months. For those that did not experience complete resolution with evening primrose oil, approximately 24% had partial resolution at 3 months, 42% had no response, and 5% experienced worsening infection (96718).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate evening primrose for these uses.",

Six weeks after discontinuing evening primrose oil, levels of lopinavir returned to the normal range of 5-10 mg/L. When re-challenged with evening primrose oil for a week, the patient's lopinavir levels increased from 6.69 to 8.11 mg/L. It is suspected that evening primrose oil increases levels of lopinavir by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which metabolizes lopinavir (93578).

In one report, three patients with schizophrenia who had received phenothiazines developed EEG changes suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy after starting treatment with GLA, although none experienced an actual seizure (21013). In another report, two patients with schizophrenia who were stabilized on phenothiazines developed seizures when evening primrose oil 4 grams daily was added. One of these patients had a prior history of seizures (21010).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nOil extracted from the seeds of evening primrose is the most common part of the plant used medicinally. The seeds contain about 14% fixed oil, which contains 65% to 75% linoleic acid, 7% to 14% gamma linolenic acid (GLA), and smaller amounts of oleic, palmitic and stearic acids, campesterol, and beta-sitosterol (49226, 112130). Other reported constituents include gallic acid, penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose, ellagic acid, (+)-catechin, and procyanidins (49216, 49244, 49245).\n\nThe evening primrose constituent GLA is an omega-6 fatty acid (49325). Gamma linolenic acid is converted to dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA) in the body. DGLA is a precursor for prostaglandin E1, which has a role in regulating immune system function, and thromboxane A1, which modulates the pro-inflammatory properties of thromboxane A2. DGLA is not converted to leukotrienes, but can inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from arachidonic acid (20512).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGamma linolenic acid (GLA) is thought to be the primary constituent of evening primrose responsible for anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces production of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) which may be involved in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (12470). GLA is metabolized to dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA), a precursor of prostaglandin E1, which inhibits inflammatory polymorphonuclear leukocyte cells. GLA may also competitively inhibit synthesis of pro-inflammatory 2-series prostaglandins. DGLA is converted to 15-hydroxy-DGLA, which blocks conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory leukotrienes. GLA and DGLA seem to improve the ratio of inflammatory and non-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes (2039, 6036, 49306).\nAnticoagulant effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that evening primrose oil can decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time (1979, 16303). In vitro research suggests that this may be due to the dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA) component (16303).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using evening primrose oil to reduce weight gain from taking isotretinoin. However, preliminary clinical research in adults treated with isotretinoin for acne vulgaris shows that taking evening primrose oil 510 mg orally daily for 9 months does not affect body weight when compared with no intervention (109430)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nEvodia is a deciduous tree that bears fruit. The applicable parts of evodia are the fruit and the root bark. Several active constituents have been isolated from evodia fruit. These include the quinazoline alkaloids rutaecarpine, dehydroevodiamine, evodiamine, hydroxyevodiamine (rhetsinine) wuchuyine, and rutaevine (15222, 15223, 15224). Dehydroevodiamine and hydroxyevodiamine have been isolated from evodia leaves (15229).\n\nQuinolone alkaloids have also been isolated from a methanol extract of evodia fruit. These include evocarpine, dihydroevocarpine, and others (15228). Evodiamine is a constituent that is isolated from the acetone extracts of evodia fruit. Other constituents have also been identified, including rutaevin, limonin, evodol, evogin, evodinone, and synephrine (15229, 15232).\nAnalgesic effects\nTwo constituents of evodia, evodiamine and limonin, appear to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models (15245, 15249). Evodiamine appears to desensitize sensory neurons, possibly due to its activity on vanilloid receptors (15245).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEvodia fruit and its constituents demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms. Evodiamine reduces production of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro (116052). The quinolone alkaloids in evodia fruit inhibit leukotriene synthesis from granulocytes in vitro (15252). Additionally, rutaecarpine, a quinazoline extract of evodia fruit, exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in animal models, partly through preferential inhibition of COX-2 (15237).\nAntibiotic effects\nThe quinolone alkaloids of evodia inhibit Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in vitro and in vivo (15228, 15231, 15251). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these constituents against H. pylori is similar to that of the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin (15251).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some interest in evodia constituents as anticancer agents. The evodiamine constituent inhibits cell proliferation from several cancer cell lines in vitro (15232, 15233, 15239). Evodiamine seems to inhibit cervical and melanoma cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis (15233). Some evidence also suggests that evodiamine might decrease cancer metastasis (15234, 15240). Evodiamine also inhibits adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis (15239).\nCardiovascular effects\nTwo extracts of evodia fruit, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, activate vanilloid receptors, resulting in a variety of potential pharmacological effects, including cardiotonic activity. Activating vanilloid receptors stimulates calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release, which is thought to protect against myocardial ischemic injury. In an animal model, evodiamine and rutaecarpine decreased myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (15243, 15244). Evodiamine and rutaecarpine are also associated with vasodilatory effects (15222, 15247), positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on animal cardiac tissue (15221, 15247), and a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation (116055). Dehydroevodiamine (DHE), a precursor to evodiamine, has vasodilatory, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects (15222, 15225). However, in animal and in vitro studies, DHE has demonstrated potent, dose-dependent proarrhythmic activity, extending the action duration potential and inducing QT prolongation and Torsade de pointes via hERG inhibition (97035).\nCartilage protective effects\nIn an animal model of osteoarthritis, intra-articular injection of evodiamine reduces cartilage degeneration, joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and measures of osteoarthritis severity. In vitro research suggests that evodiamine reduces expression of inflammatory markers and matrix-degrading enzymes, while maintaining collagen-II levels and inhibiting nuclear factor pathways implicated in osteoarthritis (116052).\nDrug metabolism effects\nAnimal research shows that the evodia constituent rutaecarpine induces the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP2E1 enzymes (15227, 107913). In vitro, evodia extract and the evodia constituents rutaecarpine and limonin inhibit hepatic CYP3A4 (15236).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is some interest in the use of evodia for gastrointestinal motility disorders. Evodiamine, an extract of evodia fruit, increases plasma cholecystokinin (CCK), activates CCK1 receptors, and inhibits gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in animal models (15226). Evodia fruit extract also slows gastrointestinal transit and has an antidiarrheal effect in an animal model (15248).\n\nRutaecarpine, a constituent of evodia fruit, might also protect against gastric injury. Rutaecarpine activates vanilloid receptors to stimulate calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release, which is thought to protect against gastric injury. In an animal model, rutaecarpine decreased gastric injury from aspirin (15242).\nHematological effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that rutaecarpine, a constituent of evodia fruit, has antiplatelet effects (15222, 15223, 15238, 107912). It is hypothesized that rutaecarpine inhibits phospholipase C activity, which reduces the breakdown of phosphoinositide, resulting in the inhibition of thromboxane A2 and a reduction in platelet aggregation (15222, 15223, 107912).\nImmune effects\nEvodia might alter immune function. The quinolone alkaloids found in evodia fruit inhibit nuclear factor proteins from activated T cells. These proteins regulate transcription of cytokine genes involved in immune response (15235).\nMigraine effects\nIn an animal model of migraine, Evodia component rutaecarpine reduces pain sensitivity, improves migraine symptoms, and decreases expression of migraine markers calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and c-Fos. It is theorized that Evodia alleviates migraine by reducing oxidative stress (116053).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in evodia for the treatment of various neurological conditions. Evodia extract has acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro, which appears to be due to the constituent dehydroevodiamine. In an animal model, evodia extract appears to decrease experimentally-induced memory impairment (15250).\n\nIn an animal model of traumatic brain injury, evodiamine improves neurological function, reduces blood-brain-barrier permeability, and decreases brain tissue apoptosis, possibly through inhibition of oxidative stress (116054).\nObesity effects\nThere is interest in evodia for treating obesity. Evodiamine, a constituent of evodia fruit, activates the vanilloid receptor, which is thought to have a role in thermogenesis, possibly by stimulating sensory nerves. In animal models, evodiamine and evodia fruit extract appear to prevent obesity and reduce body fat (15246).\nUterine effects\nExtracts of evodia have uterine stimulant effects in vitro and in animal models. This uterine stimulant effect appears to be due to the constituents rutaecarpine and dehydroevodiamine (15229).\nVascular effects\nA crude extract of evodia seems to increase blood pressure and cause tachycardia in animal models (15225); however, the independent effects of specific constituents on blood pressure appear to be different than the crude extract."
