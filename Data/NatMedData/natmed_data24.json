            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of wasabi are the roots, stems, and leaves. Allyl isothiocyanate, found in the highest concentrations in the roots, is the major flavor component of wasabi (29145, 101228). Wasabi also contains 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate, 5-(methylsulfinyl) pentyl isothiocyanate, 7-(methylsulfinyl) heptyl isothiocyanate desulfosinigrin, linolenoyloleoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol, alpha-tocopherol, and ubiquinone-10 (29139, 55558, 55559, 101229).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, the wasabi constituents linolenoyloleoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (55559). The wasabi constituent 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate also has anti-inflammatory activity (101229).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, wasabi root, stem, and leaf extracts have antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori strains (29145).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, an aqueous extract of wasabi root inhibits growth of human colon cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and autophagy (101229). A constituent of wasabi, 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate, inhibits growth of various cancer cell lines including breast, melanoma, leukemia, and stomach cancers (29137, 29138, 29139). This activity may be due to reaction of 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate with sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in biomolecules (29142, 29143). Another wasabi constituent, linolenoyloleoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol, inhibits colon, lung, and stomach cancer cell growth (55559). However, desulfosinigrin, a constituent of wasabi, can promote the growth of human colon and lung cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner (55558).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research in mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks shows that giving oral wasabi leaf 200, 100, or 50 mg/kg daily prevents several adverse metabolic changes in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the high-fat diet alone. The effects of wasabi leaf 50 mg/kg daily are similar to those of metformin 250 mg/kg daily. Wasabi reduces serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin levels, and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia. It also reduces obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, and abdominal fat density. Suggested mechanisms are upregulation of AMPK-related hepatic glucose enzyme activities and increased activity of the antioxidant defense systems (106757).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn animal research, 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate, a constituent of wasabi, inhibits platelet aggregation, possibly by reacting with sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in biomolecules (29142, 29143).\nBone metabolism effects\nIn vitro and in animal research, extracts from wasabi leafstalk have an anabolic effect on bone metabolism (29144).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research in a rat model of obesity and metabolic syndrome induced by 8 weeks of a high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet shows that adding wasabi powder 5% to the diet daily for a further 8 weeks attenuates the development of hypertension when compared with the diet alone. There is also an increase in levels of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Disruption of the gut microbial flora is thought to contribute to the development of hypertension (106758).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAn extract of wasabi root has activity in a mouse model of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It reduces diarrhea and weight loss, lowers serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels, and reduces infiltration of mast cells into the colon (101227). An ethanol extract of wasabi root prevents development of colitis in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis by inhibiting NF-kappa-B, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and maintaining epithelial tight junctions (101228).\nHepatic effects\nAnimal research in mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks shows that giving oral wasabi leaf 200, 100, or 50 mg/kg daily reduces liver weight, liver function test values, hepatocyte size, steatosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the high-fat diet alone (106757).\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nAnimal research in mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks shows that giving oral wasabi leaf 200, 100, or 50 mg/kg daily is associated with reductions in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, when compared with the high-fat diet alone. Suggested mechanisms are upregulation of lipid metabolism-related gene expression and modulation of pancreatic lipid digestion enzyme activity (106757).\nMetabolic effects\nIn animal research, wasabi and its constituent 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) are a focus of study for metabolic effects. A study in rats fed high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets suggests that wasabi containing 6-MSITC alters fat composition and reduces body weight, fat mass, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and blood glucose when compared with control (112719).\nMuscle effects\nIn animal research, 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC), a constituent of wasabi, reduces activation of calpain-1, a protease enzyme that causes gradual loss in strength during prolonged eccentric exercise (106759). However, in young, healthy, untrained males, taking 6-MSITC 9 mg daily for 5 days does not change calpain-1 plasma levels after eccentric exercise of the elbow flexor muscles or levels of muscle damage markers or inflammatory markers when compared with placebo (106759).\nNervous system effects\nAllyl isothiocyanate, the pungent constituent of wasabi, activates TRPA1, a type of excitatory ion channel on sensory neurons of the pain pathway (29147)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of watercress are the above ground parts. Watercress contains mustard glycosides, mustard oil, glucosinolates such as gluconasturtiin, and nitriles such as 3-phenylpropionitrile and 8-methylthiooctanone nitrile (85568, 85600). It also contains protein, minerals, including manganese, iron, phosphorus, iodine, copper, and calcium, and vitamins A, B6, C, E, and K, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin (19, 85598, 85599, 109663, 109664). Watercress also contains chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenes, and coumarins (85550, 109663). Watercress also contains 16:3 omega-3, a polyunsaturated fatty acid (68114).\n\nMicrobial contamination of watercress is common. In one evaluation of raw watercress obtained from supermarkets, grocery stores, and self-service restaurants, 96% of samples were found to contain acarids, acarid eggs, insects, nematode larvae, and ciliated protozoa (85552).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that applying a gel containing watercress extract to the skin of mice reduces edema and leukocyte infiltration caused by croton oil (99815). In adults with physical disabilities, watercress extract 750 mg/kg daily for 5 weeks reduces levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein but does not lower cytokine levels (103891). Clinical research in healthy young males shows that consuming 100 grams of watercress does not affect plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha when compared with consuming lettuce or neither vegetable (109665). Other clinical research in healthy, untrained adults undergoing 30-minute high-intensity workouts shows that eating fresh watercress 85 grams 2 hours before the workout up-regulates the post-exercise immune response, with increases in levels of both pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1-beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha), and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10), when compared with consuming 85 grams of lettuce (109663).\nAnticarcinogenic effects\nThe organic isothiocyanates (ITCs), or mustard oils, that are present in watercress have chemo-preventive properties due to their inhibition of carcinogen metabolic activation. Watercress contains phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring ITC, which has been shown to block chemical carcinogenesis in laboratory research (85572, 85566, 55547, 85556, 85555, 85551, 85553, 85593, 85597, 85595, 4019, 85568). PEITC is released by chewing watercress (4019). Additionally, the microflora in the intestine can hydrolyze glucosinolates in watercress to ITCs (85551).\nAntidiabetic effects\nClinical research in healthy young males shows that after consuming a meal containing 100 grams of watercress, lettuce, or neither, the area under the plasma glucose or insulin concentration time curves and the peak plasma insulin levels are lower with lettuce than with watercress or control. There is no difference in these values between watercress and the control (109665).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome clinical research shows that watercress extract has antioxidant effects. In adults with physical disabilities, watercress extract 750 mg/kg orally daily for 5 weeks reduces lipid peroxidation, as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase levels (103891). However, in another study using the same dosage regimen in the same patient population, only lipid peroxidation was reduced (109666). Clinical research in adults on maintenance hemodialysis for at least 3 months shows that taking an ethanol extract of watercress 500 mg daily for 4 weeks has mixed effects on biomarkers of oxidative stress, reducing serum malondialdehyde (MDA) while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) when compared with placebo. It is also associated with stable total antioxidant capacity (TAC), compared with a decline seen with placebo (109664).\nDiuretic effects\nWatercress is thought to have diuretic activity. The mustard oil constituent of watercress is believed to be responsible for this effect (18).\nLipid effects\nClinical research in overweight adults with physical disabilities shows that taking watercress extract 750 mg/kg daily for 5 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with placebo, but does not affect total cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (109666). Clinical research in healthy young males shows that consuming 100 grams of watercress does not affect plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with consuming lettuce or neither vegetable (109665). Clinical research in adults on maintenance hemodialysis for at least 3 months shows that taking an ethanol extract of watercress 500 mg daily for 4 weeks is associated with small decreases in total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol (109664)."

Oral wheat bran seems to be beneficial for restoring normal bowel function in people with mild constipation.\nTaking wheat bran orally seems to be effective for treating mild constipation and restoring normal bowel function in adults and children. Wheat bran seems to increase stool output and improve colonic transit, but it does not soften normal-viscosity stool. In adults, doses of 20-25 grams daily are used. In children, an age-based dose of 5-10 grams daily for those under 1 year of age, 10-20 grams daily for 1-2 years of age, and 20 grams daily for those over 2 years of age has been used (6265, 11004, 11116, 11117, 94068). Additionally, a large clinical study in Chinese adults with constipation shows that taking wheat bran 5 grams daily in combination with blond psyllium for 4 weeks relieves hard stools when compared with placebo (112994).

Additionally, a large clinical study in Japanese patients with previous removal of colorectal tumors shows that taking wheat bran 7.5 grams daily for 4 years does not reduce the risk of new colorectal tumors when compared with not taking wheat bran. Additionally, this study suggests that taking wheat bran increases the occurrence of large colorectal tumors after 4 years. Half of the patients included in this research were also taking Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (111959).

Although there is interest in using oral wheat bran to prevent various types of cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of wheat bran for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear whether consuming wheat bran can improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.\nSmall crossover studies in adults with type 2 diabetes have yielded conflicting outcomes. One small study shows that consuming 25 grams of fiber, including wheat bran, daily as part of the diet for 6 weeks can improve glycemic control and reduce insulin and plasma lipid levels when compared with a high-fiber diet providing 50 grams of fiber daily. However, another small crossover study shows that consuming bread or cereal providing wheat bran 18 grams daily for 3 months does not improve glycemic control or lipid levels when compared with a low-fiber diet providing 4 grams of fiber daily (6266, 10328). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may relate to the type of fiber added to the diet. More recent research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming wheat bran 40 grams daily for 1 month reduces fasting blood glucose, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein, and body weight when compared to baseline (113126). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral wheat bran is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA small clinical study in adults with normal weight or obesity shows that taking wheat bran 20 grams daily for 1 month does not reduce serum total cholesterol or triglycerides when compared with placebo (113127). However, most participants had normal serum lipid levels, and it is unclear if any of the participants had hyperlipidemia at baseline.\nless\nHypertension. Although there is interest in using oral wheat bran for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of wheat bran for this purpose.\nMelasma. Topical wheat bran extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with melasma shows that applying a cream containing wheat bran extract 3.45% and lycopene 0.05% twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce the severity of melasma, but not the area of affected skin, when compared with a placebo cream. Both groups were also provided with sunscreen and advised to use throughout the study (105569). It is unclear if this effect is due to wheat bran, lycopene, or the combination.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral wheat bran can reduce stress.\nA small clinical study in healthy male adults shows that taking wheat bran 25 grams daily for 28 days does not improve self-reported stress and mood or modify physiological measures of stress responses (113128). However, the study may have been of too short duration and inadequately powered to detect a difference.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate wheat bran for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: Wheat bran is a source of dietary fiber. Daily adequate intakes (AI) of dietary fiber for healthy individuals are as follows: males 19-50 years, 38 grams; males 51 years and older, 30 grams; females 19-50 years, 25 grams; females 51 years and older, 21 grams; during pregnancy, 28 grams; during lactation, 29 grams (11120).\n\nWheat bran is most often used in doses of 20-30 grams daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nWheat bran may contain high levels of phytate, which can alter the absorption of nutrients by binding to cations such as iron, zinc, and calcium. Phytate content varies depending on growing methods and seasons. Phytate is also neutralized during food processing and within the small intestine. This makes it difficult to determine the extent, if any, to which the phytate in wheat bran might alter nutrient absorption (1858, 103788, 103789, 103790, 103923).\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: Wheat bran is a source of dietary fiber.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe fiber present in wheat bran is not absorbed (100638). However, it is fermented by bacteria in the colon to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), hydrogen, and methane which are absorbed into the bloodstream (113124). Clinical research shows that after ingestion of wheat bran 25-40 grams in a single dose, the SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate increase in the blood as early as 1-2.5 hours after ingestion, with levels still slightly above baseline 24 hours after ingestion (113124, 113128).\nMetabolism\nDietary insoluble fiber is not digested by enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract and reaches the colon largely intact (100640).\nExcretion\nInsoluble fiber in wheat bran is fermented in the colon by the gut bacteria and some of the products, such as SCFAs, are excreted in the feces (100638, 113124). Some products from this fermentation, such as hydrogen and methane, are also exhaled (113124).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nWheat bran is the outer layers of wheat grain, separated during milling. It constitutes about one-fifth of the total grain by weight. The major component of wheat bran is fiber, both insoluble and soluble, but it also contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and phenolic compounds (100641). The main insoluble fibers present in the bran are arabinoxylans, accounting for 17% to 33% of the total bran (100638, 100639).The effects of wheat bran are dependent on particle size. In addition to changes in surface area, ultra-fine grinding breaks down the fiber matrix and releases the contents of cells. It also disrupts chemical bonds in insoluble fiber, making smaller, more soluble molecular fragments (100641, 113127).\n\nWheat bran oil is prepared by soaking the bran in diethyl ether for 24-48 hours, then filtering and evaporating the liquid filtrate (100642). The oil contains lower levels of saturated fats and higher levels of unsaturated fats than lard. It also contains phytosterols including campesterol, campestanol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, and stigmastenol (100642).\n\nInsoluble fiber in wheat bran reaches the colon intact and is an important carbon and energy source for colonic bacteria, resulting in fermentation of the fiber (100638, 100640, 113124, 113125, 113127). Changes in the type of bran, particle size, processing methods, or digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract can alter the types and activity of the colonic bacteria, and the products of the fermentation process (100638, 100640). The products of the fermentation process may also vary as a function of individual differences in gut microbiome and fermentation-related hydrogen and methane gas excretion profiles (113124).\nAnticancer effects\nIt has been proposed that high dietary fiber intake can prevent certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer via mechanisms such as insoluble fiber binding and removing carcinogens from the intestine (111959). Additionally, the fiber in wheat bran reaches the colon virtually unchanged and is then fermented by the colonic bacterial flora (100640). The products of fermentation include short chain fatty acids such as butyrate which may have anticancer effects (100639). In the distal colon, butyrate reduces ammonia produced by fermentation of foods high in fat and sugar, possibly preventing cell damage and reducing the risk of colon cancer (375). In healthy individuals who add wheat bran to their diet in the form of cereal bars eaten twice daily for 4 weeks, fecal concentrations of butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria are increased (100639).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIncreases in serum glucose seen in rats fed a high-fat diet are lower, and glucose tolerance is improved, when wheat bran is added to the diet (100641, 113123, 113125). Another animal study in obese rats shows that adding red wheat bran to the diet reduces insulin resistance and postprandial glucose levels (103787). However, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes is conflicting as to whether regular intake of wheat bran improves glycemic control (6266, 10328, 113126).\nAntihypercholesterolemic effects\nWheat bran or wheat bran oil added to a high-fat diet in animals moderates increases in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver cholesterol content (100641, 100642). Wheat bran constituents decrease plasma total cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Wheat bran also increases fecal excretion of sterols, which are products of the breakdown of cholesterol in the gut, including unabsorbed cholesterol and cholesterol secreted in the bile (100642). However, clinical research is conflicting on whether taking wheat bran daily, at least in the short term, reduces serum cholesterol levels (113126, 113127).\nDermatological effects\nThere has been interest in using wheat bran extracts in topical skin lightening products possibly due to hydroquinone, found in wheat bran extract, inhibiting tyrosinase activity (105569).\nEndocrine effects\nSoluble fiber in wheat bran slows the release of glucose from food and can bind free fat molecules in the gut, preventing their absorption (100641).\nGastrointestinal effects\nWheat bran has laxative effects. The insoluble fiber present increases fecal bulk, promotes peristalsis, decreases intestinal transit time, and increases frequency of bowel movements (6265, 11463, 100639, 100641). Wheat bran has negligible water-holding capacity and no stool softening effect in people with normal stools (6265, 113127). The laxative effect of wheat bran is dependent on particle size. Larger particles have a greater laxative effect than smaller particles (6265).\nPsychological effects\nIt is theorized that the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced from the fermentation of wheat bran by intestinal bacteria may improve psychological outcomes via a microbiota-gut-brain axis. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the SCFAs may alter gene expression, bind receptors, interact with vagal afferents, cross the blood brain barrier, affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and modify cortisol release (113128). However, in clinical research, wheat bran 25 grams daily for 28 days did not modify serum brain derived neurotrophic factor, the cortisol response to acute stress, cortisol awakening response, or subjective ratings stress and mood (113128).\nWeight loss effects\nSoluble fiber in wheat bran enhances feelings of fullness and stimulates release of appetite-suppressing hormones which can aid in weight loss. Rats fed a high-fat diet have less weight and adipose tissue gain, lower food consumption, and reduced lipogenic enzyme expression in liver and adipose tissue when they also receive wheat bran (100641, 113125). Specifically, gene expression for fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma was reduced when wheat bran was added to the diet (113125). However, in humans with abdominal obesity, consuming wheat bran with or without whey protein for 12 weeks does not seem to affect adipose tissue gene expression or inflammatory markers (103786)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of wheatgrass are the above ground parts, root, and rhizome. Wheatgrass contains large amounts of chlorophyll. High-chlorophyll beverages are sometimes included in diets purported to treat diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (5286, 6982). It also contains vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, iron, calcium, magnesium and amino acids (93017).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nHigh-chlorophyll beverages such as wheatgrass juice are sometimes included in diets purported to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (5286, 6982).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe wheatgrass constituent, apigenin, may have anti-inflammatory activity, which might explain its use for ulcerative colitis (11165). Clinical research in adult patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer shows that taking 60 mL of wheat grass juice daily throughout chemotherapy treatment increases levels of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and attenuates the decline in white blood cell count when compared with control (104878).\nAntibacterial effects\nA constituent of wheatgrass, agropyrene, seems to have antibiotic activity (7162).\nAnticancer effects\nHigh-chlorophyll beverages such as wheatgrass juice are sometimes included in diets purported to treat diseases such as cancer (5286, 6982). In vitro evidence suggests that apigenin, a constituent of wheatgrass, inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of cancer cells (93017). Clinical research in adult patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer shows that taking 60 mL of wheat grass juice daily throughout chemotherapy treatment decreases levels of vascular growth factors, procoagulants, and markers of vascular damage when compared with control. Theoretically, these effects may slow tumor progression and reduce the adverse effects of some chemotherapies, but further research is needed to confirm (104879).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research shows that administering ethanol extract of wheatgrass 100 mg/kg daily for 30 days can decrease levels of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. This effect is attributed to the ability of wheatgrass to simulate insulin release from beta-cells (93018). Other animal research shows that wheatgrass cam improve glucose and insulin levels in male rats with diabetes, possibly by increasing the activity of glucose oxidative enzymes (93019).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe wheatgrass constituent, apigenin, may have antioxidant activity, which might explain its use for ulcerative colitis (11165). Also, chlorophyll is thought to protect mitochondrial membranes from gamma-radiation. This may help lessen side effects of cancer treatment (93017).\nChelation effect\nPreliminary clinical evidence suggests that wheatgrass juice can reduce iron levels in patients needing to undergo repeated blood transfusions, including those with myelodysplastic syndrome and intermediate thalassemia (93022).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that fresh wheatgrass juice induces a dose-dependent reduction in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic rats. The effect is similar to that of atorvastatin (93017)."

Most adverse effects are dose-related.\nCardiovascular\nIn one case report, use of an unclear quantity of whey protein over one month was thought to be probably responsible for the development of coronary embolism in three coronary arteries in a 33-year-old male with no history of atherosclerosis risk factors. The patient required treatment with intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and heparin (96023).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, whey protein has been reported to trigger the onset or worsening of acne. Multiple case reports in teenagers and young adults have associated intake of whey protein with the development of acne or the worsening of existing acneiform lesions. In these reports, the discontinuation of whey protein was typically associated with the clearance of acne lesions. In some cases, patients who were unresponsive to acne treatments while using whey protein became responsive after whey protein discontinuation (103965, 103970, 103971). Cow's milk, which is comprised of 20% whey protein, is also thought to exacerbate acne. It is theorized that this effect may be due to the growth factor and alpha-lactalbumin content of whey protein (103971, 103982).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, whey protein, especially in higher doses of 2.3-6.5 grams/kg daily, may cause increased bowel movements, nausea, thirst, bloating, esophageal reflux, cramps, and reduced appetite (2640, 85961, 85702, 86043, 86074, 86075, 86084, 86089, 86095).\nless\nHepatic\nIn two case reports, acute cholestatic liver injury occurred after consumption of the combination of whey protein and creatine supplements (46701, 90319).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn one case report, a 26-year-old male experienced fasciitis, or swelling of the forearms, hands, and legs, after consuming the supplement Pure Whey (85895).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, high doses of whey protein may cause tiredness or fatigue and headache (2640).

Regular consumption of whey protein in conjunction with exercise may improve muscle strength and performance. However, inconsistent consumption of whey protein, as well as intake of whey protein without concomitant exercise, may not be beneficial.\nMost clinical research shows that taking whey protein 1.2-1.5 grams/kg or 30-33 grams daily in combination with strength training for 6-21 weeks can increase lean body mass, strength, and muscle hypertrophy in healthy young adults (16728, 16729, 16748, 46552, 85765, 85910, 91806, 96025, 102173). Higher doses of whey protein, such as 46-77 grams daily, have also been shown to increase strength when combined with athletic training (98886, 98888). Some clinical research shows that whey protein hydrolysate (Lacprodan HYDRO.365, Arla Food Ingridiens Group P/S) twice daily for 1 week may slightly improve running speed (91793).\n\nHowever, less frequent intake or lower doses of whey protein do not seem to be beneficial for muscle strength. Some clinical research in middle-aged males shows that taking whey protein 35 grams three times weekly with resistance training for 14 weeks does not improve strength or muscle mass when compared with placebo (46736, 85893). A small clinical study in trained males shows that taking whey protein 25 grams daily has no effect on body mass or strength after 2 weeks of detraining and 4 weeks of retraining when compared with maltodextrin (96021). Also, consuming whey protein without concomitant exercise does not seem to improve body composition or strength. Some clinical research shows that whey protein does not improve muscle mass or strength in obese postmenopausal patients who are losing weight through diet without exercise (98889).\n\nSome research has compared whey protein to other types of protein. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research, as well as individual clinical studies, show that whey protein is similarly beneficial to soy, beef, chicken, and dairy (casein with whey) protein for improving muscle strength (85941, 98871, 98888, 105591). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the small size and high heterogeneity of the studies.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral whey protein does not seem to improve COPD symptoms.\nClinical research in adults with COPD shows that taking a specific whey protein supplement (ImuPower) 12 grams twice daily for 6 weeks can improve shortness of breath, but not lung function, exercise tolerance, or quality of life, when compared with placebo (86302). Other clinical research shows that taking a pressurized whey protein supplement 20 grams daily for 16 weeks, in combination with strength training for weeks 8-16, does not improve exercise tolerance, lung function, or muscle function when compared with placebo (86025).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral whey protein does not seem to improve bone mineral density in older adults.\nClinical research shows that taking whey protein 30-45 grams daily for up to 2 years does not improve bone density when compared with a low-protein placebo in postmenopausal patients and males over 70 years of age (86074, 91796). Taking whey protein 20-60 grams daily for 36 weeks also does not improve bone density when compared with an isoenergetic placebo in overweight or obese adults undergoing an exercise program (96027). The effect of whey protein in patients with osteoporosis has not been evaluated.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for age-related cognitive impairment.\nPreliminary clinical research in older adults with subjective cognitive decline shows that taking whey peptide 1 gram for 12 weeks does not improve memory, executive functioning, or attention when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fatigue, whey peptide modestly improved memory (98885).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial in children with asthma.\nA very small clinical study in children with asthma shows that taking a specific type of whey protein (HMS 90, Immunotec Inc.) 20 grams daily for 30 days does not improve lung function when compared to baseline (85833). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if consuming infant formula containing whey protein reduces the risk of developing eczema.\nA high-quality meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that use of infant formula containing hydrolyzed whey protein for 4-6 months is no better than standard milk formula for reducing the risk of eczema (105585). This is in contrast to older meta-analyses that found benefit after consumption of fully or partially hydrolyzed whey protein (85987, 86007, 86048). However, these older publications had notable conflicts of interest and did not include small negative studies (105585).\n\nIn 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim in healthy infants with a family history of allergy who are not solely breastfed. It stated that feeding a formula of 100% partially hydrolyzed whey protein instead of formula containing intact cow's milk proteins from birth up to 4 months of age may reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis throughout 1-3 years of age. However, the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim (102311).\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if consuming infant formula containing whey protein reduces the risk of developing atopic disease.\nA high-quality meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that use of infant formula containing hydrolyzed whey protein for 4-6 months is no different than standard milk formula for reducing the risk of atopic disease. However, there was a non-significant trend to reduced risk in the hydrolyzed whey protein group (105585). This finding conflicts with older meta-analyses which found benefit with hydrolyzed whey protein formula (85987, 86007). However, these older publications had notable conflicts of interest and did not include small negative studies (105585).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for children or adults with cystic fibrosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with cystic fibrosis shows that taking pressurized whey protein, 20 grams in children and 40 grams in adults, daily for 28 days, improves lung function in children, but not adults, when compared with baseline (85995). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for improving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.\nA small clinical study in patients with well-controlled diabetes shows that consuming a 220 kcal drink containing whey protein concentrate 50 grams (Beit Haemek Advanced Technologies, Beit Haemek) before a meal lowers blood glucose levels by 28% and increases insulin levels in the first 3 hours after a meal when compared with drinking water (91795). However, whey protein does not seem to have long-term benefit on glycemic control when added to an exercise regimen. Another small clinical study in middle-aged males with type 2 diabetes shows that adding 20 grams of whey protein daily for 10 weeks to high-intensity mixed-mode interval training (MMIT) does not further improve glycemic control or body composition when compared to MMIT with placebo (98883).\nless\nExercise-induced asthma. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for exercise-induced asthma.\nA small clinical study in patients with exercise-induced asthma shows that taking whey protein 30 grams daily for 10 days improves lung function when compared to baseline (85791). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for attenuating exercise-induced muscle damage; evidence is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that supplementation with a median dose of whey protein 25 grams (range 20-120 grams) given after and/or before exercise modestly improves muscle recovery measured over 3 days when compared with control (98881). Individual studies included in the analysis used whey protein 1.5 grams/kg daily for up to 2 weeks (86044), and whey protein isolate or whey protein hydrolysate (NatraPro or NatraBoost XR, MG Nutritionals) 25 grams three times in 24 hours (85915).\n\nOther small studies have not found benefit, but it is unclear if they were adequately powered. One small clinical study in healthy untrained males shows that taking whey protein 36.6 grams daily, starting 7 days before and continuing until 4 days after arm exercise, does not prevent muscle soreness over 5 days or attenuate reductions in strength (96024). Another small study in untrained healthy males shows that taking whey protein isolate (biPro, Eden Prairie) 0.3 grams/kg three times daily for 5 days does not reduce self-reported delayed onset muscle soreness, but may reduce creatine kinase, a biomarker of muscle damage, when compared with water (104758).\n\nWhey protein may not be beneficial for recovery from exercise in trained athletes. Small clinical studies show that consuming a whey protein beverage before or after exercise does not improve muscle recovery for trained adult and adolescent athletes when compared with a carbohydrate or non-caloric control (86303, 91799, 105592).\nless\nHepatitis. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for hepatitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis B shows that taking a specific type of whey protein (Immunocal) 12 grams twice daily for 12 weeks can reduce liver transaminase levels and can increase glutathione (GSH) levels when compared with baseline. However, whey protein supplementation does not seem to improve liver function in patients with chronic hepatitis C (85687). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for improving immune function in children with HIV/AIDS.\nOne small clinical study in children with rapidly progressive HIV infection shows that taking whey protein at levels corresponding to 20% to 50% of total required protein for 4 months does not affect CD4 or CD8 cell count or the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ when compared with baseline. However, the occurrence of acute co-infections might be reduced with whey protein supplementation when compared with control (85781).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Although oral whey is an adequate source of protein, it is unclear if it is better than other protein sources for reducing HIV/AIDs-related wasting.\nA small open-label clinical study in malnourished patients with HIV shows that taking whey protein (dose unspecified) daily for 14 weeks increases muscle and fat mass when compared with baseline (85693). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another small study in patients with HIV, stable weight, and a history of unintentional weight loss shows that taking whey protein 40 grams daily for 12 weeks does not affect weight or muscle mass when compared with taking an isocaloric control (85921). These study findings are limited because they cannot be generalized to patients with active weight loss or wasting. Another limitation is the higher dropout rate in the whey protein group due to gastrointestinal adverse events.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for lowering cholesterol levels.\nA very small clinical study in overweight males with hyperlipidemia shows that taking whey protein 26.6 grams daily while participating in a resistance training program for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol levels when compared with baseline but not when compared with placebo (85941). A meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical studies in healthy adults, as well as those with obesity and/or mild hypertension, shows that consuming whey protein alone or with other interventions seems to reduce lipid levels when compared with control (105586). However, most included studies were in patients without hyperlipidemia; it is unclear if whey protein is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, these findings are limited by the variability in whey protein dosing, study duration, and patient population.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral whey protein reduces blood pressure.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking a beverage containing whey protein 2.6 grams daily for 12 weeks does not lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension when compared with placebo (85835). Also, taking whey protein 28 grams twice daily in water for 8 weeks reduces 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2.9 mm Hg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with maltodextrin or casein in adults with mild hypertension and prehypertension. There were also improvements in endothelial function (96019).\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral whey protein improves symptoms in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.\nA small clinical study in individuals with mitochondrial diseases shows that taking a whey protein supplement 10 grams daily for one month does not improve muscle strength or quality of life when compared with placebo (85984).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral whey protein improves NASH.\nA small clinical study in patients with untreated NASH shows that taking whey protein 20 grams daily for 12 weeks can reduce liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and reduce hepatic macrovesicular steatosis when compared with baseline (85961). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial for weight loss when used without dietary modifications. Adding whey protein to a calorie-restricted diet or an exercise regimen does not seem to improve weight loss.\nMost research in overweight and obese individuals shows that taking whey protein along with a low-calorie diet and/or in addition to an exercise program does not further increase weight loss when compared with the low-calorie diet or exercise alone (85897, 86069, 86130, 91794, 91798, 91802, 96027, 102172). However, a small clinical study in patients who have regained weight after bariatric surgery shows that following a low-calorie diet and taking whey protein 0.5 grams/kg daily for 16 weeks reduces body weight by about 2 kg and fat mass by about 3 kg when compared with following a low-calorie diet alone (96022).\n\nWhen whey protein is taken without diet modifications, studies have yielded conflicting results. One small clinical study in overweight and obese adults shows that taking whey protein isolate 27 grams twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight when compared with a glucose control (86011). However, another small clinical study in overweight and obese adults shows that taking whey protein concentrate 52 grams daily for 23 weeks reduces weight by 1.8 kg and fat by 2.4 kg when compared with a carbohydrate control, but is no better than taking soy protein isolate 52 grams (86077). In contrast, a small clinical study in overweight males shows that taking whey protein concentrate 65 grams before lunch daily for 12 weeks decreases calorie intake and reduces weight by about 1 kg when compared with taking soy protein isolate 60 grams (91801).\n\nIn contrast to adults, supplementation with whey protein might increase weight in adolescents. A clinical study in overweight adolescents shows that consuming 1 liter of a milk-based whey protein drink daily for 12 weeks increases weight and body mass index when compared with a water control (86144).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral whey protein improves symptoms of Parkinson disease.\nClinical research in a small group of patients shows that taking a specific type of whey protein isolate (HMS 90/Immunocal) 10 grams twice daily for 6 months does not improve symptoms of Parkinson disease when compared with placebo (96026). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral whey protein improves symptoms and metabolic effects of PCOS.\nOne small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking 240 kcal as a nutritional supplement containing pure whey protein 96% daily, in addition to a calorie-restricted diet for 2 months, reduces body weight, fat mass, and cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels when compared with a simple sugar control supplement. However, the whey protein supplement does not improve glucose or insulin levels, and seems to decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (85912). The validity of this study is limited by its small size and a significant dropout rate.\nless\nPolymyalgia rheumatica. It is unclear if oral whey protein improves muscle function in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica.\nA small clinical study in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica shows that taking a whey protein-enriched dairy product twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve lower limb muscle function, walking speed, chair stand test performance, peak jump power, or peak jump force when compared with a regular dairy product (Play, Valio Ltd.) (86075).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral whey protein improves psoriasis.\nA small clinical study in patients with stable psoriasis shows that taking a specific whey protein extract product (Dermylex, Advitech, Inc.) 5 grams daily for 8 weeks modestly decreases symptom severity when compared with placebo (85885).\nless\nSarcopenia. Research on the use of oral whey protein in older adults with sarcopenia is conflicting.\nSmall clinical studies in trained older females show that consuming whey protein 35 grams three times weekly for 12 weeks, either before or after resistance training, modestly increases skeletal muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity when compared with resistance training and insufficient protein intake (98887, 98890). Research on the use of whey supplementation without exercise is conflicting. A small clinical study in older adults with low muscle mass living in China shows that taking whey, or a whey-soy protein blend, 16 grams daily for 6 months slightly attenuates muscle loss when compared with no intervention (105603). However, a clinical study in healthy, active older adults living in Denmark shows that taking whey protein hydrolysate 20 grams twice daily does not increase muscle size or strength when compared with a carbohydrate control (105593). This finding may not be generalizable to frail adults or those with existing sarcopenia.\n\nWhey protein with or without exercise has shown benefit when used in combination with other nutrients. Specifically, whey protein 60 grams has been used with creatine 5 grams, calcium 800 mg, vitamin D 1000 IU, and omega-3 fatty acids 3 grams (Infinit Nutrition) for 6 weeks (96016). A beverage with leucine-enriched whey protein 20 grams has been used in combination with vitamin D 800 IU (Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition) daily for 6 weeks (96017). Another beverage containing whey protein 20 grams and vitamin D 800 IU has been used daily for 6 months (98882).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral whey protein is beneficial in children with sepsis.\nA very small clinical study in long-term intensive care pediatric patients shows that taking a specific whey protein supplement (Beneprotein) 0.3 grams/kg daily for up to 28 days has a similar effect on the time to onset and the rate of hospital-acquired infection or sepsis when compared with taking a combination of zinc, selenium, glutamine, and metoclopramide. It is not clear how these results compare to patients receiving no supplementation (86095).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate whey protein for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nWhey protein, as whey protein concentrate, hydrolysate, or isolate, has most often been used in doses of up to 30 grams daily for up to 6 months.

Gastric emptying rates appear to be the same with whole whey protein and hydrolysates and with casein protein and hydrolysates (85751).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nWhey protein is a milk protein. It primarily consists of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and immunoglobulin. It generally contains a higher concentration of essential amino acids than other protein sources (16728, 86053, 86213). The composition of whey protein may vary slightly depending on the animal species from which it was obtained (85605, 85622, 85688, 86209, 86260).\nAnti-allergy effects\nWhey protein has been studied for atopic disease such as asthma and dermatitis possibly because it may attenuate immune response (4927, 85987, 86007). Animal research suggests that consuming whey protein may degrease the immune response to the food antigen ovalbumin and other antigens (85700, 85717). Furthermore, animal research suggests that whey protein may have anti-inflammatory effects (85850, 85935).\nAntibacterial effects\nWhey protein has been used to prevent hospital infections and sepsis (86095). Whey protein may help prevent infection due to its antimicrobial and bacteriostatic effects that have been shown in laboratory and animal studies (85894, 85939, 85988, 86004).\nAntiburn effects\nIn animal models, whey protein appears to supply the optimal nutrition to promote healing of cutaneous burns (85803, 86166).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe benefits of whey supplementation have been studied in diabetic patients (91795). Whey protein appears to reduce postprandial increase in blood glucose after a meal possibly by slowing glucose absorption into the blood (86058, 86139, 86141, 91795). The amino acids in whey protein appear to increase insulin responses which would further help manage hyperglycemia (16731, 85872, 85888, 86030, 86058, 86100, 86119, 86129). Another theory of how whey protein may help reduce blood glucose in diabetics is the increase of incretin response after supplementation (86088, 86139, 86141).\nAntilipemic effects\nWhey protein is unlikely to clinically benefit cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemia or healthy patients (85941, 86058, 86081, 86119, 86130, 96019). However, whey protein fermented with Lactobacillus may have a cholesterol lowering effect (86014).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSome researchers are interested in using whey protein to prevent cancer. It's thought that whey protein might prevent cancer by providing glutathione (GSH) substrates and increasing tissue GSH levels (4943). Whey protein might exert antitumor effects by depleting tumor cells of GSH, making them more vulnerable to chemotherapy (2640, 4930, 85714, 86038, 86206, 86228). Animal models of cancer show that whey protein diets might protect against certain cancers (3976, 4928, 4933). However, this does not seem to be the case in clinical research. A small study in cancer patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy shows that consuming 40 grams of whey protein isolate with zinc and selenium daily for 12 weeks does not increase levels of GSH, interferon, CD4+, albumin, or other immune markers when compared with placebo (98880).\nAntioxidant effects\nWhey protein may have positive effects on certain disease states, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatitis, due to its antioxidant effects (85687, 85961). Animal and laboratory research support that whey protein has antioxidant, radical-scavenging, and metal-chelating effects (85796, 85804, 85818, 85907, 85913, 85940, 86037, 86281). Clinical research associates whey protein consumption with antioxidant effects such increased glutathione (GSH) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (86115, 86136). However, whey protein might not have measurable antioxidant effects in all patient populations. Clinical research in healthy females 60 years and older shows that taking whey protein 35 grams before and after daily resistance training for 12 weeks does not improve antioxidant enzyme activity nor oxidative stress markers when compared with placebo (102174).\nBone effects\nWhey protein supplementation does not appear to help improve bone mineral density in osteoporosis (86074, 91796). However, theoretically, the calcium content of whey protein may offer some benefit as shown in animal research (85787, 85914).\nCardiovascular effects\nResearchers are also interested in whey protein for cardiovascular conditions. There is preliminary evidence that a unique combination of hydrolyzed whey protein isolates inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which may result in decrease in blood pressure (6171, 85614, 85637, 85699, 85713, 85726, 85729, 85738, 85749, 85750)(85760).\nGastrointestinal effects\nConsumption of whey protein alters gut hormones. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that whey ingestion reduces plasma levels of ghrelin and increases levels of insulin, glucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in a dose-dependent manner. These effects on CCK, GLP-1, and ghrelin suggest that whey protein might reduce appetite and energy intake. Plasma levels of CCK and GIP were more elevated in older adults compared to younger adults (98884). Aging seems to reduce the degree to which high-calorie drinks decrease hunger, satiety, and energy intake. Thus, protein-rich nutrition supplements, including whey protein supplements, may be an effective strategy to increase energy intake in undernourished older adults (105588). A small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming whey protein once prior to a fat-rich meal reduces glucose, increases GLP-1 in response to insulin and glucagon, and delays gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner (102171).\nImmunomodulating effects\nWhey protein may vary in the amount and activity of immunoglobulins and other proteins present, depending on the production methods used (2640). Whey protein typically contains 24% branched chain amino acids which are readily oxidized as an energy source during stress. Whey protein is also a source of gamma-glutamylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione (GSH), which acts as an intracellular antioxidant (2640). GSH is depleted by oxidative stress, which occurs during infections, trauma, or major surgery (2640). Low levels of GSH in patients with HIV have been associated with impaired T-cell function (2640). A specific whey protein formulation (Immunocal) might enhance the reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) in lymphocytes, a marker of oxidative stress in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated diseases, including AIDS-related wasting (1382). Whey products also have anti-HIV and anti-apoptotic effects in vitro (4937). In patients with HIV infection, whey protein increases body weight (85693) and reduces co-infections, but might not affect CD4 and CD8 counts (85781). Whey protein also has immunomodulating activity (4939, 4940). It's thought that immunoglobulins in whey protein may bind antigens in the gut and prevent their absorption (2640). Whey protein formulations can be produced that are high in specific immunoglobulins. For example, whey proteins derived from the milk of cows infected with Cryptosporidium may be a rich source of antibodies against Cryptosporidium (2640). These types of whey protein formulations can reduce gastrointestinal Cryptosporidium parvum infection in animal models (4934).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is also interest in whey protein as a protein source in high-protein diets used for weight loss and improving athletic performance. In animal models, a whey protein diet seems to reduce weight and improve insulin sensitivity compared to red meat (12111). Whey protein supplementation also results in higher blood amino acid concentrations compared to some other protein sources. This results in greater stimulation of protein synthesis (16728). Research in healthy volunteers shows that consuming whey protein 10-25 grams following exercise can stimulate muscle protein synthesis, which could potentially lead to increased muscle hypertrophy (16730, 68819, 85764, 85931, 86041, 86046, 86052, 86056, 86080). In healthy males performing resistance exercise, whey protein 20 grams improved the optimal muscle protein synthesis by 49%, while 10 grams did not appear to have an effect (91803). Consuming whey protein with a single meal has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis (96017, 104640). However just supplementing with whey protein 30 grams daily for 2 years without additional exercise does not appear to affect muscle mass or physical function in healthy postmenopausal patients (91804).\n\nConsumption of 20-80 grams of whey protein appears to increase satiety and decrease appetite in a non-dose dependent manner, possibly by increasing gastrointestinal peptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (86079, 91797, 102175). Whey protein has been associated with lower ghrelin concentration compared to soy protein, which may contribute to the satiety feeling after whey protein consumption (86077). Research also shows that males who ingest 45 grams of whey protein have increased levels of insulin. Whey protein increases insulin secretion to a greater extent than whey protein hydrolysate (16731).\n\nIn older adults, whey protein intake with a single meal does not increase satiety, resulting in increased caloric intake. However, it does slow gastric emptying of the meal. This is possibly due to alterations in various gastric hormone levels (96020)."

These alkaloids inhibit the inactivation of the sodium ion channels and thus have a paralyzing effect on many excitable cells (18, 95892, 101431)."

Although there has been interest in using oral white mulberry for androgenic alopecia, there is insufficient reliable evidence about the clinical effects of white mulberry for this purpose.\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral white mulberry for symptoms of the common cold, including cough and sore throat, there is insufficient reliable evidence about the clinical effects of white mulberry for this purpose.\nDiabetes. While research is mixed, most small clinical studies suggest that oral white mulberry does not reduce fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, it does seem to improve insulin resistance and postprandial blood glucose in these patients.\nA meta-analysis of 4 small, mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes shows that taking white mulberry extract for 12 weeks does not reduce HbA1c when compared with placebo, dietary education, or no treatment. White mulberry extract also does not reduce fasting plasma glucose but may improve glucose intolerance (110480). However, studies utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens, with doses ranging from 500 mg twice daily to 4.6 grams three times daily and 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) content in each dose ranging from 5-18 mg. Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes not included in the analysis above shows that taking white mulberry extract 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves insulin resistance but does not reduce fasting blood glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo (110481). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. One clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking powdered white mulberry leaf 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose levels by 27% compared with an 8% reduction with glyburide 5 mg daily. However, neither treatment significantly reduced HbA1c levels over the 4-week period (16494). The short study duration may explain the lack of significant HbA1c reduction.\n\nThe effect of white mulberry on postprandial glucose levels has also been assessed. Taking a single 0.8-1.2 gram dose of powdered white mulberry leaf standardized to contain DNJ 1.5% or taking a single 250 mg dose of a specific white mulberry leaf extract (Reducose, Phynova Group) standardized to contain DNJ 4.5% to 5.5% reduces peak blood glucose levels after ingestion of 50-75 grams of sucrose when compared with placebo in adults with or without type 2 diabetes (16495, 17051, 105796).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral white mulberry is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia; the available research has mixed results.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking white mulberry extract 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not decrease serum triglycerides, or levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (110481). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. However, another small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking white mulberry leaf 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol levels by 12%, triglycerides by 16%, LDL by 23%, and VLDL by 17% when compared to baseline. Plasma HDL was increased by 18% (16494). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nWhite mulberry has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. In one small clinical study, taking a specific product (LopiGLIK, Akademy Pharma) containing white mulberry leaf extract 200 mg, berberine, and red yeast rice daily for 4 weeks reduced LDL cholesterol to less than 130 mg/dL in 57% of participants, compared with only 22% of those receiving a different combination product (Armolipid Plus, RottapharmSpA) that contains red yeast rice, berberine, and other ingredients, without white mulberry. Both products reduced triglycerides and total cholesterol to a similar extent (100624).\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral white mulberry for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable evidence about the clinical effects of white mulberry for this purpose.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral white mulberry is beneficial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.\nOne small clinical study in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking white mulberry leaf powder 4.6 grams three times daily before meals for 12 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose by around 4 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.12% when compared to baseline. Neither measure was improved in the placebo group (103870). Although a statistically significant improvement in glycemic control was established, the observed reductions in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were modest and unlikely to be clinically meaningful.\nless\nJoint pain.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of white mulberry are the leaves, stems, fruit, and root bark. Constituents found in white mulberry leaves include flavones, steroids, triterpenes, amino acids, vitamins, trace minerals, and nitrogen-containing iminosugars (16497). The fruit contains anthocyanins, including cyanidin and pelargonidin glycosides, and flavonols, including quercetin and kaempferol (100625).\nAnti-cancer effects\nExtracts from dried white mulberry have anticancer activity. In vitro, extracts inhibit growth of leukemia cells. These extracts also appear to inhibit growth of multi-drug resistant cells (14619).\nAnti-gout effects\nPreliminary research in animal models shows that morin, a constituent of white mulberry twigs, reduces uric acid levels. Morin is thought to inhibit xanthine oxidase and have uricosuric activity (14617).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAn extract of white mulberry fruit inhibits inflammatory processes in macrophages in vitro by inhibiting the synthesis and release of nitric oxide. It also reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (100625).\nAntidiabetes effects\nWhite mulberry leaf powder has been traditionally used in the treatment of diabetes. It seems to have both antihyperglycemic effects and hypoglycemic effects (16496, 17051). In one clinical study of adults with type 2 diabetes, white mulberry leaf reduced fasting blood glucose levels (16494). However, in a study of healthy, non-diabetic adults, taking 1.2 grams of the powder before each meal for 38 days reduced postprandial glucose levels, but did not result in hypoglycemia (17051). A constituent of white mulberry leaf, a nitrogen-containing sugar called fagomine, potentiates glucose-induced insulin release (16496, 16497). Additionally, several compounds identified in the leaves and roots of white mulberry have alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activity. Inhibition of this enzyme in the intestinal lumen and brush border interferes with carbohydrate digestion, so that glucose is released more slowly from food. This reduces postprandial peak blood glucose levels and endogenous insulin secretion (16495, 16498, 16500).\n\nWhite mulberry leaf extracts inhibit intestinal alpha-glucosidase enzymes to different degrees. Sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase are inhibited by 95% to 99%, lactase by 38%, and trehalose by 44% (16495, 17052). Compounds identified in the leaves and roots of white mulberry that have alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activity include 1-deoxynojirimycin (moranoline), N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, fagomine (1,2-dideoxynojirimycin), 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol, calystegin B2 (1-alpha,2-beta,3-alpha,4-beta-tetrahydroxy-nor-tropane), 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-(2-o-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-arabinitol, and 2-o-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (16498, 16499, 17051, 17052, 103870). The most active alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is 1-deoxynojirimycin, which is present in the highest levels in young leaves taken from the top parts of branches in the summer (17051). The N-hydroxyethyl derivative of 1-dexoynojirimycin is marketed in the United States as the prescription drug miglitol (Glyset) (16498). The 1-deoxynojirimycin content of commercial white mulberry products varies, with some containing less than 0.05% (17051).\n\nAnimal research shows that diabetic rats fed dried white mulberry leaf powder as 25% of their diet for 8 weeks become virtually normoglycemic and stop excreting glucose in their urine (16496, 16497). Abnormal hepatic gluconeogenic activity is reduced, and insulin release in response to glucose is increased (16496). White mulberry leaf extract also reduces development of nephropathy and microalbuminuria in diabetic rats. A high glucose level in the kidneys increases the activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and the levels of the inflammatory mediator, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B. These increases seem to be attenuated by white mulberry leaf extracts (100628).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nAnimal research shows that rats with hyperlipidemia fed white mulberry leaf powder gain less weight, have lower blood glucose and lipid levels, and have reduced atherosclerotic lesions compared to rats not consuming the powder (14616, 14618, 16904). The reduction in atherosclerotic lesions is thought to be due to increased resistance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidative changes (14616). Animal models also show that diets supplemented with white mulberry root bark extract increase antioxidant activity and improve lipid levels (16903). In studies of mice on a high-fat diet, adding white mulberry fruit powder or leaf polysaccharides to the diet attenuates increases in serum LDL (110482, 110483).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome constituents of white mulberry have antimicrobial activity. Kuwanon G, a constituent of the root bark, has in vitro bactericidal activity against Streptococcus mutans and other microorganisms found in the mouth (16899). A flavonoid extract from the root bark has in vitro antiviral activity against the herpes simplex type I virus (16898).\nAntioxidant effects\nWhite mulberry leaf extracts have antioxidant activity, including reducing abnormal lipid peroxidation in erythrocyte membranes and improving activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (16494, 16497). There are also compounds in white mulberry leaves that have free radical scavenging activity, including quercetin, a glucopyranoside of quercetin, moracin C, moracin N, prenylflavane compounds, and chalcomoracin (16497, 16896).\nBone effects\nA small clinical study shows that taking a mixture of white mulberry and Vietnamese coriander extracts for 8 weeks increases plasma levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, which are markers of bone formation. This combination also decreases C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), a marker of bone resorption (100626). It is not clear if these changes produce clinically significant improvements in bone density. Additionally, it is not clear if these effects are due to white mulberry or Vietnamese coriander.\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using white mulberry for hyperpigmentation disorders. Extracts from white mulberry leaves have been shown to inhibit melanin production (16897).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using white mulberry to prevent metabolic syndrome. In studies of mice on a high-fat diet, adding white mulberry fruit powder or leaf polysaccharides to the diet improves glucose tolerance, and attenuates weight gain, fat accumulation, and increases in serum LDL (110482, 110483). Feeding mice white mulberry also attenuates changes in gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokines (110483).\nPsychiatric effects\nThere is interest in using white mulberry to improve recovery from stress. A preliminary study in animals suggests that dried white mulberry fruits have some effect on the actions of monoamine oxidase A and B during exercise (14615). However, the significance of this is not known.\nWeight loss effects\nDeoxynojirimycin in white mulberry inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine. This results in delayed breakdown and absorption of polysaccharides after consumption (100627). In a study in mice, white mulberry leaf polysaccharides inhibit pancreatic lipase, which is necessary for dietary fat absorption (110482). In studies of mice on a high-fat diet, adding white mulberry fruit powder or leaf polysaccharides to the diet attenuates weight gain and fat accumulation (110482, 110483)."

Suppression of T-cell activity and inhibition of the production of interleukins 4 and 5 might play a role in this process (29181).\nAntiamebic effects\nIn animals, the white pepper constituent piperine demonstrated antiamebic activity against cecal amoebiasis (29199).\nAnticancer effects\nThe white pepper constituent piperine has demonstrated anti-cancer effects in animal models, including reduced tumor growth (29226, 29309, 29313, 29324). In animal research, piperine also reduced tumor nodule formation, as well as lung collagen hydroxyproline, tissue uronic acid, lung hexosamine, and serum sialic acid and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (29277). In vitro, piperine inhibited proliferation of cancer cells, induced differentiation, and had additive or protective effects against toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, depending on concentration (29319, 29320, 29321, 29322). Potential mechanisms of action for anticancer effects of piperine include decreased protein-bound carbohydrate levels, altered mitochondrial enzyme activity, enhanced detoxification enzymes, reduced DNA damage, protein phosphorylation, modulation of lipid peroxidation, augmentation of antioxidant defense systems, reduced genotoxicity and chromosomal aberrations and aldehyde dehydrogenase, and a suppression of metabolic activation by mutagens (29309, 29310, 29311, 29312, 29313, 29314, 29315, 29316, 29317, 29318)(29323, 29324). In animals with lung cancer, piperine decreased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls, nucleic acid content, and polyamine synthesis, and normalized erythrocyte membrane and tissue ATPase enzyme activities (29325, 29326). In combination with 5-fluorouracil, piperine enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth in animals (29274).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animals fed a high-fat diet, the white pepper constituent piperine improved plasma levels of insulin (29188). Evidence from animal research suggests that piperine can reduce blood sugar levels (29225).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, the white pepper constituent piperine inhibited aflatoxin B1-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, potentially by inhibiting some cytochrome P450 metabolic effects (29332, 29333). However, in animals, piperine enhanced the bioavailability of aflatoxin B1 (29330).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, white pepper has exhibited antimicrobial effects (71743). The white pepper constituent piperine inhibited glucan production by oral bacteria and had efflux inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (29172, 29173). Piperine also inhibited ochratoxin A production by inhibiting the polyketide synthesis step in Aspergilli (29174).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal research, the white pepper constituent piperine had antioxidant effects, including the protection of erythrocytes from oxidative stress and reduced oxidative stress associated with a high-fat diet (29179, 29180). In rats, intraperitoneal administration of piperine resulted in enhanced hepatic oxidized glutathione concentration and decreased renal glutathione concentration and renal glutathione reductase activity. In diabetic rats, piperine reversed the effects on oxidized glutathione concentration in the brain, on renal glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, and on cardiac glutathione reductase activity and lipid peroxidation (29338). However, piperine did not reverse all diabetes-associated oxidative effects measured in this model. Also, in vitro, piperine acted as a superoxide scavenger at low concentrations and increased the generation of hydroxyl radicals at high concentrations (29339, 46243). In other in vitro research, piperine exerted cardiac myocyte protective effects due to its antioxidant activity (29344).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro, the white pepper constituent piperine had antiparasitic effects against Trypanosoma cruzi, which involved ultrastructural alterations (29201, 29202). In animal research, piperine had antiparasitic effects against Leishmania species (29203, 29204).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal research, piperine exerted positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in the isolated spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria; the calcitonin gene-related peptide was involved (29279, 29280). However, in other animal research, intravenous piperine had hypotensive effects, likely through calcium channel blockade (29224).\nChemotherapy protective effects\nIn vitro, the white pepper constituent piperine protected non-cancer cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (29273).\nCoagulation effects\nIn vitro, the white pepper constituent piperine inhibits platelet aggregation (29206).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, the white pepper constituent piperine inhibits gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit (29356, 29357). Piperine has had various effects in animals, including protection against castor oil, arachidonic acid, and magnesium sulfate-induced diarrhea, possibly due to an effect on calcium-related contractions as shown in isolated organs, as well as protection from gastric ulceration, possibly due to protective prostaglandins and increased activity of enzymes, such as lipase, amylase, sucrose, maltase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin (29350, 29351, 29352, 29353, 29354, 29355, 29362, 46178, 49538). In one animal study, increased gastric acid secretion following piperine administration was likely due to stimulation of histamine H2 receptors (29358, 39864).\n\nPiperine appears to affect absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro, piperine inhibited digoxin and cyclosporine A transport in Caco-2 cells (29208). Piperine also produced effects such as stimulated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, enhanced uptake of radio-labelled amino acids, enhanced lipid peroxidation in freshly isolated epithelial cells of rat jejunum, and altered kinetic behavior of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase towards substrate and acceptor, indicating increased permeability of intestinal cells (29363). Potential mechanisms of action explaining the gastrointestinal effects of piperine may involve the vanilloid receptor TRPV1(29158).\nGenitourinary effects\nIn vitro, the white pepper constituent piperine induced bladder contraction, which was partially mediated by transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1) (29343, 64149).\nHepatic effects\nIn animal research, the white pepper constituent piperine has had both hepatoprotective and hepatotoxic effects. In various hepatotoxicity models, piperine had hepatoprotective effects, such as increased hepatic glutathione, sulfhydryl, cytochrome B5, and cytochrome P450 levels, and decreased malonaldehyde (3760, 29197, 29198). Also, piperine inhibited enzymatic drug biotransformation reactions in the liver, inhibiting hepatic and intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase (29364). In animal and in vitro research, piperine has been shown to both stimulate or inhibit aryl hydroxylase, and inhibits N-demethylase, hepatic microsomal glucuronyl transferase, and liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (29365). Other hepatic enzymes have also been shown to be affected by piperine in laboratory research. For example piperine may decrease NADH-dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase and increase Mg(++)-ATPase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, benzphetamine N-demethylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase, aniline hydroxylase, and microsomal cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 activities (29366, 29367). However, increased activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase has also been implicated in the piperine-induced increase in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity as shown in animal research (29227).\nHormonal effects\nThe anti-fertility effects of the white pepper constituent piperine have been investigated in both male and female animal models. In males, piperine resulted in testicular and accessory sex organ apoptosis, perhaps initiated by inhibited testicular superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide generation, and decreased sialic acid in germ cells (29215, 29216). Other changes included partial degeneration of germ cells and damage to seminiferous tubules and spermatocytes and spermatids (29216). Also, piperine decreased weights of the caput, corpus, and cauda regions of the epididymis, decreased epididymal sperm count and motility and sperm vitality, and decreased sialic acid levels (29217). Fertility effects in the testes were thought to be due to decreased phospholipid concentration and free cholesterol, increased total cholesterol and cholesterol ester, and modifications in the ratio of triacyl to diacyl glycerols (29347). In female animals, piperine increased the period of the diestrous phase, resulting in decreased mating performance and fertility (29218). Other negative effects included anti-implantation period five days post-mating with oral use and total absence of implants following intrauterine injection. However, in super-ovulated female hamsters, intragastric piperine increased the rate of fertilization following artificial insemination, with no difference in stage of embryonic development after 48 hours (29278). In pregnant mice, piperine inhibited implantation, produced abortion, and delayed labor; uterotonic activity and hormonal effects were not implicated (29348). In vitro, piperine in the capacitation medium inhibited the percentage of eggs fertilized and the degree of polyspermia, without effect on sperm motility (29349).\nImmune effects\nThe effects of white pepper constituents have been investigated on immunological endpoints in laboratory research. In animals and in vitro, piperine improved or normalized various immunological endpoints such as cell viability, oxidative stress, apoptotic markers, cell proliferative response, T and B cell phenotype changes, and cytokine release following treatment with the immunotoxicant cadmium (29219, 29220, 29221, 29222). In vitro, piperine inhibits adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial monolayer; this is potentially due to its ability to block tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and E-selectin (29223).\nLipid effects\nIn animals, piperine beneficially reduced plasma lipid and lipoproteins levels, increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and improved levels of apo A-1 and apo B (29188, 29378). In vitro, piperine inhibited acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity (29271).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using white pepper as an antidepressant. In animal research, the white pepper constituent piperine had antidepressant effects and a protective effect on neuroblastoma cells (29182, 29183, 29379). In other animal research, piperine protected against chronic unpredictable mild stress (29184, 29185). Suppression of monoamine oxidase activity has also been implicated in the antidepressant effects of piperine (29186, 29187).\n\nThere is also interest in using white pepper for seizures. In animal research, injection of the white pepper constituent piperine blocked convulsions induced by intracerebroventricular injection of threshold doses of kainite, but had no or only slight effects on convulsions induced by L-glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, or guanidinosuccinate (29341, 29342). In another animal study, the effect of piperine on convulsions was associated with higher levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cerebral cortex and lower levels in the hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum, as well as higher levels of dopamine in the hypothalamus and decreased norepinephrine throughout the brain (29342).\n\nOther neurologic effects of white pepper have been evaluated. In animal research, the white pepper constituent piperine had cognition-enhancing effects; the mechanism of action is unclear (29379). Although some laboratory studies suggest that the depletion of substance P may play a role in the effects of piperine, not all studies agree (29380, 29287). Also, in vitro, piperine caused a sustained net inward current associated with either an increase or decrease in membrane conductance. It also blocked potassium channels in neurons (29381, 29382). However, piperine has also demonstrated cytotoxicity with neurons, including cerebellar granule neurons and hippocampal neurons, but not astrocytes (29239, 29240, 29241, 29383).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is interest in using white pepper for asthma. In animals, the white pepper constituent piperine exhibits anti-inflammatory effects (29175, 29176, 29177). The anti-inflammatory effect of piperine was suggested to be due to chronic granulative changes and stimulation of the pituitary adrenal axis (29175). In vitro, piperine decreased the production of prostaglandin E2, the expression of interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase13, and decreased inflammatory responses of adipose tissue on macrophages (29176, 51958). The anti-inflammatory effects of piperine may also result from reduced expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (29368). In human research, stimulation of the mucosa of the upper airway with white pepper powder caused dilation of the trachea and bronchi accompanied by a decrease in airway resistance in laryngectomized patients (29391). The effect of this dilation appears to be overpowered by the constriction of the larynx and, as a result, an increase in airway resistance was observed.\nVascular effects\nIn isolated rat hind limb, the white pepper constituent piperine stimulated oxygen uptake and increased vascular resistance (29384)."

Species such as Dioscorea villosa have higher amounts of diosgenin and this species is not usually eaten (13167). Dioscorea opposite, or Chinese yam, also contains 0.15% adenosine and 0.08% arbutin (96723).\nAnti-osteoporotic effects\nA study in spayed female, osteoporotic rats shows that giving diosgenin daily for 12 weeks improves markers for bone architecture and structure when compared with control (112221).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA study in type 2 diabetic male mice shows that giving diosgenin daily for 24 weeks improves markers of retinopathy (i.e. retinal thickness and number of retinal ganglion cells) when compared with control (112222).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn an animal model of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, wild yam reduced diarrhea. Although the mechanism of action is not known, possibilities include enriching levels of probiotic bacteria and overall bacterial diversity in the large intestine. Also, the constituent allantoin seems to help with cecal healing (102611). In addition, the wild yam constituent diosgenin prevents estrogen-induced bile flow suppression (5129) and attenuates indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation (5131).\nHormonal effects\nThe chemical transformation of the wild yam constituent diosgenin to estrogen, progesterone, or other steroidal compounds is not thought to occur in the human body (515). However, wild yam does seem to have some estrogenic properties, although these properties vary between species. One wild yam extract enhances estradiol binding to estrogen receptors and induces transcription activity in estrogen-responsive cells (6180). In laboratory research, evaluation of four Dioscorea species, including D. oppositifolia (Chinese yam), D. alata, D. collettii var. hypoglaucau, and D. zingiberensis, found that only Dioscorea oppositifolia exhibits estrogenic effects on ovarian cells (96725). In animal research, the extract from Dioscorea oppositifolia increases levels of estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), upregulates the expression of estrogen receptors in the uterus, and induces the proliferation of breast cancer cells via stimulation of estrogen receptors. Adenosine and arbutin are thought to be the constituents responsible for these estrogenic effects (96723). Postmenopausal adults who substitute 390 grams daily of wild yam (Dioscorea alata) for another staple food such as rice for 30 days have significant increases in serum estrone, sex hormone binding globulin, and possibly serum estradiol levels (13167). There is some evidence that the diosgenin constituent of wild yam might stimulate growth of mammary tissue (5130).\n\nTopically applied wild yam doesn't appear to cause changes in serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, or progesterone (10989).\nNeurological effects\nIn animal studies, the wild yam constituent diosgenin improves memory deficits and enhances object recognition memory (96724)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIntake of willow bark extract or salicin itself results in increased plasma levels of salicylic acid (12808, 86460). More than 80% of the salicin in willow bark is absorbed after oral administration (86482). Bioavailability of willow bark may be lower than synthetic salicylates due to manufacturing processes. A dose of 240 mg of salicin is equivalent to 87 mg of aspirin (12808).\nMetabolism\nPeak levels of salicylic acid, as well as its metabolites, salicyluric acid and gentisic acid, are reached within 2 hours after oral administration of willow bark extract. Approximately 86% of the total of these three metabolites is salicylic acid itself (12808).\nExcretion\nSalicyluric acid as the predominant metabolite in the urine after oral use of willow bark extract. The plasma half-life of salicylic acid appears to be 2.5 hours (12808).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nWillow bark is the bark of Salix tree species such as the white willow. Willow bark constituents include flavonoids, tannins, and salicylates. The most active constituent of willow bark is thought to be salicin. Salicin is metabolized to salicyl alcohol and then to salicylic acid. From there, metabolism is the same as aspirin (12808). Other salicylates may include salicortin and tremulacin (86466). Salicin content of various willow species ranged from 0.04-12.6%; levels were dependent on the season, year of growth, and actual Salix species (86474, 86486). Although willow bark extracts are usually standardized to salicin content, some authors believe that polyphenols, such as flavonoids, may also play a role in the benefits of willow bark (86471, 91406).\nAnalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that willow bark extracts have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (12476, 86492). An ethanolic extract of willow bark seems to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mediated prostaglandin release, but it doesn't seem to directly affect COX-1 or COX-2 activity. Constituents of willow bark other than salicin may have lipoxygenase-inhibiting and antioxidant effects that could contribute to its analgesic effect (6456, 12476, 86467). They also might prevent prostaglandin and cytokine release (12476, 86492). Some research suggests that extended treatment with willow bark may be necessary for a therapeutic effect (12809, 12812).\nAntiplatelet effects\nWillow bark inhibits platelet aggregation, but to a lesser degree than aspirin (12810).\nAntipyretic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that willow bark extracts have antipyretic effects (12476).\nWeight loss effects\nWillow bark is sometimes included in weight loss supplements. Some evidence suggests that willow bark or aspirin and caffeine might act synergistically with ephedrine for weight loss by inhibiting prostaglandin, which increases norepinephrine release. However aspirin, and theoretically willow bark, have no thermogenic effect when given alone (314, 729, 10003, 12811)."

Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to amnesia, dementia, physical dependence, and somnolence. Other effects of chronic use are chronic cerebellar syndrome, Korsakoff's psychosis, and Wernicke's encephalopathy (6843, 8972, 9004, 34055, 34068).\n\nHeavy alcohol consumption (15 or more drinks weekly) is also associated with a higher percentage of white matter changes and larger ventricular and sulcal size on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This suggests that heavy alcohol consumption decreases cerebral blood flow and may contribute to brain atrophy (8651). Consumption of any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (841, 2271).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is evidence that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with the mutation of the p53 gene in individuals with esophageal carcinoma (9005). There is also some evidence that heavy consumption of wine is associated with the highest risk of esophageal cancer when compared with heavy consumption of beer and spirits (8972, 9004). Chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (three or more drinks daily) can lead to mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and liver cancer (6843, 8972, 9004, 31557, 33977, 34010, 34037, 34045, 34061, 34065)(34069, 34085). Some research suggests an association between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but other studies do not support this association (8038). Daily consumption of one or more alcoholic drinks in females might increase the risk of breast cancer by 2% to 15% and increase mortality from breast cancer by as much as 30% (6843, 8100, 8974, 9006, 96686). There is also evidence suggesting that females who consume alcohol daily have an increased risk of developing breast cancer when the daily intake of folate is 300 mcg or less (8974, 9006). However, the association of wine intake and breast cancer risk in females may vary depending on the type of wine. Red wine results in higher levels of free testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) and lower hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels when compared with white wine. This suggests that red wine has similar activity to aromatase inhibitors and may not increase the risk of breast cancer unlike white wine (97992).\n\nObservational research suggests that wine consumption is associated with a higher risk of developing skin cancer in females and a higher risk of invasive melanoma in both males and females (97055, 97991).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, wine can cause a variety of side effects which depend on the amount of alcohol ingested and can vary among individuals.

The side effects depend on the amount ingested and can vary among individuals. A common side effect includes respiratory depression (6843, 8972, 9004). Wine is also associated with triggering asthmatic reactions in people with a history of asthma, possibly due to salicylates and/or added sulfites contained in wines (6174).\nless\nOther\nOrally, chronic heavy alcohol ingestion (3 or more drinks daily) can lead to malnutrition and poor glycemic control (6843, 8972, 9004).\n\nThere is some evidence consumption of more than 6 beers per week is associated with a larger waist-to-hip ratio than those consuming an equivalent amount of hard liquor or wine. However, an association between moderate alcohol intake equivalent to approximately 3 beers per week or less and waist-to-hip ratio does not seem to exist (10164, 10165).

Consumption of up to one alcoholic drink daily is associated with better cognitive function in older males.\nObservational research in elderly males suggests that a history of consuming up to 1 alcoholic drink daily is associated with better general cognitive function during their late 70s and 80s when compared with non-drinkers (6824, 6829). However, consumption of more than 4 drinks daily during middle age seems to be associated with significantly poorer cognitive function in later life (6824).\nless\nDiabetes. Light to moderate consumption of alcohol, including wine, is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in those with existing type 2 diabetes. However, the benefits of wine in the management of type 2 diabetes are unclear.\nObservational research in healthy males suggests that light to moderate alcohol consumption from wine and other sources is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (6172, 6891). A meta-analysis of 13 population studies suggests that drinking about 1.5-2 five-oz glasses of wine daily is associated with the greatest reduction in the risk of developing diabetes in both males and females, with a 20% lower risk when compared with never drinking wine (96699). Additionally, in patients with a history of gestational diabetes, consuming approximately 3 servings of wine weekly is associated with a 44% to 54% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with no consumption in age-adjusted and multivariate analyses, although this result was no longer significant when adjusted for BMI. Consumption of 1-2 servings of wine weekly was associated with a 42% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in age-adjusted analyses only (105948).\n\nLight to moderate alcohol consumption, including wine, is also associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in males and females with type 2 diabetes when compared with non-drinkers with type 2 diabetes. The risk reduction for CHD associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with type 2 diabetes is similar to that found in people without diabetes who consume light to moderate amounts of alcohol (8653, 8654). Additionally, a cross-sectional study in patients with type 2 diabetes suggests an inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and carotid intima media thickness (107816).\n\nHowever, despite these promising results in observational research, clinical studies specifically addressing wine consumption in patients with type 2 diabetes show mixed results. A meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies, most of which had a short follow-up period, shows that moderate wine consumption does not improve glycemic control, blood pressure, or lipid levels when compared with control beverages or alcohol abstinence in patients with type 2 diabetes (103187). However, another study not included in the above analysis that evaluated people with diabetes who abstained from alcohol prior to the study shows that drinking 5 oz of white wine, but not red wine, daily for 2 years reduces fasting blood glucose by 17 mg/dL and reduces homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score by 1.2 when compared with drinking mineral water. In a subgroup analysis of slow ethanol metabolizers (homozygous carriers of the wild-type C alcohol dehydrogenase alleles, ADH1B*1), drinking red or white wine improves glycemic control when compared with patients that are fast ethanol metabolizers (homozygous for ADH1B*2) (96697). Another clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes who are consuming a Mediterranean diet shows that drinking 150 mL of red or white wine daily with dinner for 2 years prevents progression of carotid atherosclerosis, though no progression occurred in a control group consuming 150 mL of mineral water daily with dinner (99641).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Moderate to high alcohol consumption seems to reduce the risk of Helicobacter pylori infection.\nObservational research suggests that moderate to high consumption of alcohol, more than 75 grams weekly, from beverages such as beer and wine, is associated with a reduced risk of infection (8034).\nless\nOsteopenia. Observational research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption may improve bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal patients.\nObservational research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption in postmenopausal patients is associated with increased BMD in the trochanter, femoral neck, mid-radius, and lumbar spine (6825, 6836, 8655). Alcohol intake of one-half to 1 drink daily seems to have the greatest effect on BMD when compared with non-drinkers and heavy drinkers of alcohol (8655).\nless\nOverall mortality. Light to moderate alcohol consumption seems to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality in middle-aged or older adults.\nObservational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in people who are middle-aged or older (2058, 6823, 6837, 6843).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if wine consumption is beneficial for preventing Alzheimer disease.\nA meta-analysis of observational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol (less than 7.5 drinks weekly or 12.5 grams daily), preferably wine, is associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer disease, when compared with non-drinkers. The lowest risk of dementia was observed with consumption of 4 drinks weekly or 6 grams daily (97063).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if alcohol consumption is beneficial for anxiety.\nThe effect of alcohol on anxiety is complex and may be affected by the psychological state of the user. It sometimes reduces anxiety, sometimes increases it, and sometimes has no effect (2266).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial for atherosclerosis.\nA cross-sectional study in patients with type 2 diabetes suggests an inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and carotid intima media thickness (107816).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if wine consumption is beneficial for preventing cancer or cancer-related mortality. The available evidence suggests variable effects depending on cancer type.\nObservational research suggests that intake of up to 21 alcoholic drinks weekly, including wine, is associated with a slightly reduced risk of cancer-related mortality (6823). However, a meta-analysis of 42 population studies suggests that wine intake is not associated with the overall risk of developing cancer, when comparing the highest intake and lowest intakes (116675). The association between wine consumption and risk of specific types of cancer has also been investigated. Moderate consumption of wine has been associated with a DECREASED risk of developing bladder cancer (97989), brain cancer (96695), renal cell cancer (97060, 97064), and multiple myeloma (97990). However, wine intake is not associated with changes in the risk of colorectal cancer (103189), endometrial cancer (97065), gastric cancer (96694), or lung cancer (116674). Furthermore, white wine consumption has been associated with an INCREASED risk of breast cancer, and skin cancer (96686, 97991, 116675). Results of a meta-analysis suggest that moderate to heavy consumption of alcohol, including wine, in males is associated with an 11% reduction in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (99638).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most observational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages is associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and a reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death. However, clinical research is limited. Also, binge drinking or regular consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes.\nSome population research suggests that consumption of alcoholic drinks, including wine, by otherwise healthy adults is associated with a reduced risk of developing CVD. Moderate alcohol use (1-2 drinks daily) is associated with a 30%-50% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction (MI) when compared with nondrinkers (2267, 2268, 2271, 6888, 6892, 8648, 8649, 10128, 11879, 96690)(116672). Other observational research suggests that drinking one or fewer glasses of wine weekly over 10 years is associated with a 60% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Light to moderate alcohol consumption is also associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (2271, 2279, 6834, 6842, 6893). There is some evidence that light to moderate consumption of alcoholic drinks (1-2 drinks daily), including wine, is also associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in people who are middle-aged or older (2058, 6823, 6837, 6843). The relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular mortality has also been investigated. Population research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality in otherwise healthy adults (2058, 2270, 6835, 6837, 116672). Also, light to moderate alcohol consumption in the year prior to a first acute MI is associated with reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk when compared with non-drinkers (8650).\n\nHowever, more than 2 drinks daily can increase the risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality (841, 2060, 2261, 6173, 6890, 8648, 11879). A 2025 Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association concludes that while the available evidence shows that consuming 1-2 alcoholic drinks per day does not INCREASE the risk for coronary artery disease, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, and stroke, it only POSSIBLY supports a risk reduction (116671). This statement is based on the overall lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of light to moderate alcohol consumption on cardiovascular outcomes. A large meta-analysis suggests that individuals who report light to moderate consumption of alcohol have overall healthier lifestyles than those who abstain from alcohol and adjusting for these lifestyle factors attenuates any of the cardioprotective epidemiological effects that have been associated with light to moderate alcohol intake (107884). Also, population research suggests that drinking more than 1 glass of wine weekly is not associated with lower cardiovascular risk when compared with abstaining from alcohol (102886). Consuming any amount of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (841, 2271, 6842).\n\nAlcohol consumption has also been evaluated in patients with existing CVD. A meta-analysis of cohort data as well as published observational and randomized controlled studies in patients with existing CVD suggests that consumption of 6-8 grams of alcohol daily is associated with a 21%, 27%, and 50% reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events, respectively, when compared with non-drinkers (107817). However, in males with established coronary heart disease (CHD), consumption of 1-14 alcoholic drinks weekly, including wine, does not seem to have any effect on CVD or all-cause mortality when compared with males who drink less than 1 drink weekly. Further, in males with a history of MI, consuming 3 or more drinks daily is associated with increased mortality (6173).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). While light to moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of developing CHF in older adults and a reduction in all-cause mortality in those with ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, it is unclear if moderate wine consumption is associated with these benefits.\nObservational research in adults 65 years or older suggests that consuming 1-4 alcoholic drinks daily is associated with a reduced risk of CHF (8104). There is conflicting evidence about whether moderate alcohol consumption improves outcomes in patients that already have CHF, although no exacerbation of CHF was found. Consumption of 1-14 alcoholic drinks per week is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in people with ischemic LV dysfunction when compared with non-drinkers with ischemic LV dysfunction. This benefit does not seem to occur for those patients with non-ischemic LV dysfunction (6827). However, other observational research has not found an inverse association between moderate wine consumption and rates of all-cause mortality, sudden death, or hospitalization in chronic heart failure patients (96689).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if wine consumption is beneficial for dementia.\nA meta-analysis of observational research suggests that light to moderate consumption of alcohol (less than 7.5 drinks weekly or 12.5 grams daily), preferably wine, is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause dementia when compared with non-drinkers. The lowest risk of dementia was observed with consumption of 4 drinks weekly or 6 grams daily. However, consumption of 23 or more alcoholic drinks weekly is associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (97063).\nless\nDepression. It is not clear if wine consumption is beneficial for depression.\nObservational research suggests that low to moderate consumption of wine (2-7 drinks weekly) is associated with a 32% lower rate of depression when compared with not consuming wine (96696).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. There is limited evidence on the consumption of red wine for metabolic syndrome.\nObservational research suggests that moderate red wine consumption (at least one 5-ounce glass daily) is associated with a 44% lower odds of developing metabolic syndrome when compared with not drinking any red wine. The association appears to be strongest for females less than 70 years-old and for people who currently smoke or have a history of smoking. Drinking white wine does not seem to affect the risk of metabolic syndrome (97062).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if wine consumption is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nSome observational research in non-smokers suggests that higher wine consumption in adolescence is linked to lower mid-life body mass index (BMI) when compared with lower wine consumption. No association between wine consumption and mid-life BMI was reported in adolescent smokers over a 20-year follow-up (103188). It is unknown if wine consumption reduces the risk of developing obesity or improves weight loss in obese patients.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if wine consumption is beneficial in preventing SLE in females.\nObservational research suggests that modest daily alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing SLE in females. When the data were stratified by alcohol type, 2 or more servings of wine weekly was associated with a 35% reduced risk of developing SLE when compared with not drinking alcohol (96684).\nless\nWound healing.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with wine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of wine.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nWine is the natural yeast fermentation product of the juice of sun-ripened grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera. Wine normally contains 10% to 14% alcohol, predominantly as ethanol, which is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant (2263).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an ex vivo study, light to moderate daily wine consumption in patients with cardiovascular disease attenuated the effects of inflammatory cytokine secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells at basal conditions when compared with alcohol not containing wine microconstituents (107820).\nAnticancer effects\nRed wine results in higher levels of free testosterone, lower sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels compared to white wine in females. This suggests that red wine has similar activity to aromatase inhibitors and may not increase the risk of breast cancer unlike white wine (97992).\nAntidiabetes effects\nModerate alcohol intake may be protective against the development of type 2 diabetes due to an increase in insulin sensitivity as shown by a decrease in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score and decreased plasma insulin (6891, 96697). There is some research that suggests that light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduction in the low-grade systemic inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes. However, plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving mediators of inflammation (SPMs), which drive resolution of this inflammation and are elevated in people with type 2 diabetes, were not affected by daily consumption for 4 weeks of 300 mL of red wine in men or 230 mL of red wine in women (99642).\nAntiplatelet effects\nSeveral red wine components, including trans-resveratrol, quercetin, and catechins, have in vitro antiplatelet effects (2057). Red wine and white wine seem to have similar effects on platelets (2057, 2949). Human data also suggest rebound hypercoagulability can occur when acute or chronic alcohol consumption stops, but that red wine attenuates this effect (2060, 2061).\nBone effects\nModerate alcohol consumption may be protective against postmenopausal bone loss due to an increase in estrogen levels, increased calcitonin secretion, and reduced parathyroid hormone secretion (6825, 6836, 8655). However, heavy and chronic alcohol consumption reduces bone mineral density, possibly due to increased calcium and magnesium excretion, increased cortisol secretion, and reduced osteoblast activity (6836, 8656). Chronic alcoholics also have other risk factors for osteoporosis, including poor nutrition, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and lower body weight (6825, 6836).\nCardiovascular effects\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for the protective effects of alcohol against coronary heart disease (CHD) (2060, 2268, 2270, 6839, 6840). One to two alcoholic drinks per day increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 12% (6892) and apolipoprotein A-I by about 2.2% (8649). This increase in HDL cholesterol levels may account for about 50% of the cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption (2261, 6838, 6841).\n\nModerate alcohol consumption also decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5% to 17% (6841, 8649), triglycerides by 5% to 10%, and apolipoprotein B levels by 3.7% (8649).\n\nSome research has suggested that ceramides are a better predictor of CVD than traditional risk biomarkers. A small clinical study of older adults at high CVD risk shows that drinking white wine in combination with the antioxidant tyrosol modulates the blood lipid profile, including reductions in the ratios of certain ceramides and attenuation of changes in plasma diacylglycerol levels, when compared with white wine alone (107821).\n\nThere is concern that moderate alcohol consumption can increase systolic blood pressure (6841). However, there is evidence that light to moderate alcohol consumption does not increase the risk of hypertension and may actually decrease the risk (8102). Furthermore, clinical studies assessing wine polyphenols alone found no significant effects on blood pressure. Clinical research shows that drinking a dairy drink containing specific red wine polyphenols (Provinols, Seppic S.A.) 280 mg or 560 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce blood pressure compared to placebo in hypertensive patients that are not at risk for cardiovascular disease. Normally 2-3 glasses of wine contain about 560 mg of polyphenols (96685). Further clinical research shows that taking grape extract (MegaNatural) 250 mg with wine extract (Provinols, Seppic S.A) 550 mg daily for 4 weeks is no different than placebo for lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension (96693).\n\nIt is possible that wine polyphenols are more effective when administered together with other natural wine constituents. For example, another small clinical study shows that drinking dealcoholized red wine daily for 4 weeks reduces blood pressure and increases serum nitric oxide levels compared to drinking red wine containing 30 grams of alcohol or gin containing 30 grams of alcohol in older men at high cardiovascular risk (96687, 96688).\n\nEffects of alcohol on blood clotting include a reduction in clotting potential and enhancement of clot breakdown (2261). Alcohol consumption decreases platelet aggregation, possibly via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (6892). Moderate alcohol consumption is also associated with an increase in plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, an indicator of fibrinolytic capacity (6894). Alcohol also seems to lower fibrinogen and interleukin-1 alpha concentrations (11943). Light to moderate alcohol consumption also seems to produce a reduction in coronary narrowing due to atherosclerosis (2261, 6840, 8652).\n\nRed wine may also have anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces plasma levels of inflammatory factors including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This follows a reduction in expression of various intercellular cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1. These markers of inflammation lead to endothelial injury and atherosclerosis (11943, 116673).\n\nAnother theory is that drinking wine can increase omega-3 fatty acid levels in the blood. Omega-3 fatty acid levels have been associated with reduced mortality from heart disease. A retrospective study found increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) associated with increased wine ethanol intake (96692).\n\nThere is also evidence that an increased intake of dietary folate or the use of supplemental folate (400 mcg/day) in moderate alcohol users can lower homocysteine levels compared with nonusers of alcohol (8101). High levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine breakdown and removal requires folate, and alcohol is an antagonist of folate metabolism (8101). The protective effect of alcohol against cardiovascular disease is lost at higher intakes of alcohol (greater than one to two drinks per day). High alcohol consumption can cause increased homocysteine levels, hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke, fatal arrhythmias, and direct damage to heart muscle (alcoholic cardiomyopathy) (2060, 2261, 2267, 2270, 8101, 8102, 8103).\n\nSome alcoholic beverages, in particular red wine, have constituents that may be more protective than others against coronary heart disease, but there is no conclusive evidence of this from clinical studies (2267, 2268, 6892).\n\nRed wine has higher concentrations of polyphenolic compounds than other alcoholic drinks. The antioxidant properties of these polyphenols may contribute to protection against coronary heart disease by reducing oxidation of LDL cholesterol (2268). The polyphenolic compounds in red wine include trans-resveratrol; proanthocyanidins; anthocyanins; and flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, and catechins (1262, 2057, 8976). However, the polyphenol content of wine is highly dependent on grape type, climate, and wine-making methods (2057). Unlike red wines, white wines have very low polyphenol concentrations (2030).\n\nThe antioxidant potential of plasma and erythrocytes is increased for up to 4.5 hours after red wine consumption (6828). However, there is some evidence that the increase of polyphenols in plasma after red wine consumption is not sufficient to acutely influence lipoprotein oxidation (1262, 6826, 8976). There is evidence that other foods such as onions and black tea may be better sources of polyphenols than red wine (8976). Additionally, a difference in lifestyle among wine, beer, and other alcohol beverage drinkers, including diet and social class, might also explain why some alcoholic beverages appear to offer more protection than others against CHD (10129).\n\nRed wine might also reduce mutagenic DNA damage and improve endothelial function when added to a high fat diet. Red wine also might have additive vaso-relaxing benefits with a low-fat, high plant material diet (2059).\n\nPossible mechanisms by which alcohol could have a protective effect against ischemic stroke include increasing HDL and prostacyclin, decreasing fibrinogen, and inhibiting platelet aggregation (6842). There is evidence that moderate alcohol intake increases cerebral blood flow (8651). Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of white matter changes and brain infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging in adults 65 years of age or older compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers (8651).\nCognitive effects\nAn observational study in Chinese adults 65 years or older with baseline cognitive function ranging from healthy to severe dementia suggests that alcohol consumption is associated with negative and long-term effects on cognitive function, even after adjusting for numerous covariates (107818).\nGastrointestinal effects\nWine stimulates gastric acid secretion and gastrin release. This may explain why moderate to high alcohol consumption from beverages such as wine seems to prevent Helicobacter pylori infection (8034)"

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of winter savory are the leaf and stem. Winter savory contains flavonoids, ursolic, ellagic, and oleanolic acids, isoscutellarein, glycosides of luteolin and quercetin, and volatile oil (11, 98681, 112316). The main constituents of the volatile oil are carvacrol, p-cymene, borneol, and gamma-terpinol, with lesser amounts of thymol, p-thymol, timol, linalool, lauolene, rosmarinic acid, caryophyllene, terpinen-4-ol, 1-octan-3-ol, and 1.8-cineole (6, 11, 98681, 106553, 112313, 112314, 112315). The total phenolic and flavonoid content of tinctures prepared from winter savory is influenced by particle size and extraction mode, with those prepared by maceration or remaceration having a high content of polyphenols. Rosmarinic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids, as well rutin and (-)-catechin, were identified in such tinctures (106553).\nAnti-anxiety effects\nResearch using an animal model shows that giving an extract of dried winter savory leaves orally daily for 14 days reduces acute anxiety. The constituents rosmarinic acid and carvacrol also have anxiolytic effects when used alone in the same model (112314).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, an alcoholic extract of the aerial parts of winter savory has anti-inflammatory activity, measured by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases 1 and 2, 5-lipoxygenase, and myeloperoxidase (112316).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, the water-soluble fraction of winter savory volatile oil has strong antimicrobial activity at 25% concentration against Pasteurella aerogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Acinetobacter baumannii. At 50%, it is bactericidal against Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, and can inhibit the growth of Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. At this concentration, it is also fungicidal for Candida albicans (106554, 112315). The antimicrobial effects involve disruption of cell membrane integrity (106554). The carvacrol constituent of the volatile oil damages cell walls, releasing lipopolysaccharides, and also disrupts ion transport across the cytoplasmic membrane (112313).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, winter savory volatile oil, and an alcoholic extract of the aerial parts prevent lipid oxygenation, and increase total antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging activity and catalase activity, and reduce malondialdehyde generation (112313, 112316). The antioxidant activity may be due to the phenolic constituent, carvacrol (112313).\nDiuretic effects\nCarvacrol, a constituent of winter savory, might have diuretic effects (6, 11).\nSexual function effects\nWinter savory is used as a traditional remedy for male sexual dysfunction, especially premature ejaculation. In an animal model, winter savory increased acute testosterone levels, as well as the time to ejaculation (98681).\nVasodilator effects\nSome evidence suggests that eriodictyol, a flavonoid found in winter savory, might have a vasodilator effect (4124)."

Wintergreen oil contains 96% to 98% methyl salicylate (6, 18). Wintergreen fruit extracts contain at least 45 phenolic constituents including salicylates, flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, flavonoids, and phenolic acid. The primary phenolic constituents of wintergreen berry extract include gaultherin, methyl salicylate triglycoside, physanguloside A, and procyanidin B2 (104534). Wintergreen leaf extracts contain over 40 phenolic constituents, including salicylates, catechins, procyanidins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids (112156).\nAnalgesic effects\nWintergreen oil contains a high concentration of methyl salicylate, which is structurally similar to aspirin (6).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro studies show that wintergreen fruit, leaf, and stem extracts inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes, including cyclooxygenase-2 and hyaluronidase, and reduce neutrophil release of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tumor necrosis-factor-alpha, and tissue remodeling enzymes (104534, 112156, 115302).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro studies show that wintergreen fruit, leaf, and stem extracts scavenge free radicals, reduce reactive oxygen species production, and restore antioxidant activity. (104534, 112156, 115302).\nDermatologic effects\nAn in vitro study in UVA irradiated cells shows that wintergreen fruit, leaf, and stem extracts reduce the production and release of reactive oxygen species, proinflammatory interleukins, and tumor necrosis-factor-alpha. This suggests that wintergreen may prevent UVA induced photodamage, which contributes to skin barrier disruption, chronic skin damage and photoaging (115302)."

The active constituents include gallotannins such as hamamelitannin, gallic acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and catechol derivatives (10377, 93895). The bark and leaves are both a source of volatile essential oils (86512, 93895). The leaf contains 8-10% tannins (512). The bark contains up to 12% tannins (10377, 93894).\n\nSteam distillation used for producing witch hazel water removes the tannins (13). Thus, the astringent properties of witch hazel water result from its 14-15% alcohol content (13).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nWitch hazel leaf and bark possess anti-inflammatory properties in animal models (10377, 86525, 86528). Constituents, such as hamamelitannin and galloyated proanthocyanidins have been shown to inhibit 5-lipooxygenase activity in laboratory research (86530). Also, tannins, applied topically to broken skin or mucous membranes induce protein precipitation. They tighten up superficial cell layers and shrink colloidal structures thereby causing capillaries to constrict. The decrease in vascular permeability approximates an anti-inflammatory effect (7). The anti-inflammatory effects of witch hazel might explain its anti-hemorrhoidal and skin-protective benefits.\nAnti-viral effects\nIn laboratory research, witch hazel bark extract had antiviral activity against influenza A virus and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16. The bark extract inhibits various steps in the influenza A virus lifecycle, as well as the attachment of HPV. Tannins play a large role in these processes (93894).\nAntimicrobial effects\nWitch hazel leaf and bark possess astringent properties (10377). Antibacterial effects of witch hazel extract have been shown in laboratory research (59335, 86516). The astringent activity of tannins causes an indirect antibacterial effect (7).\nStyptic effects\nWitch hazel leaf and bark possess styptic properties (10377).

However, there is speculation that some of the symptoms of absinthism originally described might be attributed to adulteration with metals or toxic plants such as calamus and tansy, rather than the ingredients usually used in absinthe drinks (15007). Some researchers also suggest that absinthism is not a unique condition and is indistinguishable from alcohol use disorder. In fact, some evidence suggests that the thujone concentrations in the absinthe formulations from the 1800s were too low to cause significant thujone-related toxicities (15008, 15009).\nless",

Although there has been interest in using oral wormwood for biliary disorders, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of wormwood for this purpose.\nCrohn disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral wormwood may modestly improve symptoms in patients with Crohn disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Crohn disease shows that taking a specific product (SedaCrohn, Noor Herbals, LLC) containing powdered wormwood 750 mg 2-3 times daily for 6-10 weeks improves quality of life and mood, increases symptom remission, and reduces corticosteroid requirements when compared with placebo (86545, 93468). Clinical remission occurred in 8 out of 10 patients taking wormwood, compared with only 2 out of 10 patients taking placebo (93468).\nless\nDepression.

It is unclear if oral wormwood is beneficial in patients with IgA nephropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with IgA nephropathy shows that taking powdered wormwood (Seda-Leukin, Noor Herbals LLC) 600 mg three times daily for 6 months along with standard treatment reduces proteinuria when compared with baseline. The urinary protein:creatinine ratio decreased from 2340 mg/gram to 315 mg/gram over 6 months. Furthermore, systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 10% and 14%, respectively (93469). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nInsect bite. Although there has been interest in using topical wormwood for insect bites, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of wormwood for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical wormwood is beneficial in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that applying an ointment or liniment containing wormwood extract 3% to the knee three times daily for 4 weeks might improve pain, although any pain improvement was not maintained 2 weeks after discontinuation. Topical wormwood appears to be less effective than topical piroxicam gel, which improves pain, stiffness, and physical function when compared with baseline, with benefits maintained 2 weeks after discontinuation (95925).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate wormwood for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSome wormwood products are prepared with an intent to minimize thujone concentrations. Thujone levels differ with respect to the method of preparation and the solvent. Percolation with water produces no thujone because thujone is not soluble in water. Percolation with 90% ethanol produces approximately 0.18 mg of thujone per gram of wormwood. Using 30% alcohol produces approximately 0.17 mg of thujone per gram of wormwood. Distillation of macerated wormwood in alcohol produces the highest concentration of thujone, approximately 0.24 mg of thujone per gram of wormwood (15007).\n\nClinical trials have investigated the effects of two specific products (SedaCrohn and Seda-Leukin, Noor Herbals, LLC) (86545, 93468, 93469). SedaCrohn contains 0.2% to 0.38% absinthin and less than 5 ppm thujone/capsule (86545, 93468). SedaLeukin contains 0.2% to 0.38% absinthin, 0.25% to 0.52% etheric oils, and is devoid of alpha- and beta-thujone (93469).",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nWormwood contains thujone, a neurotoxin, which can be removed during preparation to reduce concerns for toxicity (15007). Oil made from wormwood leaves contains high concentrations of thujone and can be toxic at doses as low as 10 mL (662, 12817). Some reports of toxicity with wormwood involve the use of homemade preparations, including a wormwood poultice for topical application and a wormwood extract for ingestion. It is unclear how much wormwood and/or thujone was present in these products (93466, 93467).\n\nThere are also concerns for toxicity with the chronic ingestion of absinthe, an alcoholic beverage that contains wormwood extract. This has been linked to absinthism, which is characterized by addiction, anxiety, auditory and visual hallucinations, bradyarrhythmias, brain damage, decreased attention, epilepsy, gastrointestinal adverse effects, increased risk of psychiatric disease and suicide, insomnia, paralysis, and tremors (662, 12814, 15008, 86541, 86543). It is unclear if all of these adverse effects are due to wormwood. There is some speculation that some of the effects might be associated with alcohol or contaminants in absinthe, such as metals or toxic plants (15007, 15008, 15009).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with wormwood.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nPreliminary research suggests that thujone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system; however, the specific human isozyme has not been identified (12816).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of wormwood are the above ground parts. Wormwood is an aromatic bush. It contains up to 0.2% to 1.7% essential oil (12814, 12815, 15007). Wormwood oil contains 40% to 90% of the monoterpene thujone, which is responsible for wormwood's'toxicity. About 70% to 90% of the thujone content exists as beta-thujone and 10% to 30% as alpha-thujone (15007). Alpha-thujone is more toxic than beta-thujone (12814, 12815). Wormwood also contains absinthin, anabsinthin, artabsin, resins, and various organic acids (12814, 12815, 93469).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nWormwood extract has been studied for Crohn disease due to its anti-inflammatory effects (86545, 93468). Wormwood extract has been shown to reduce levels of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-1, in laboratory models and human research (93468).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, a methanolic extract of wormwood aerial parts has demonstrated antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (107484).\nCannabinoid receptor effects\nThujone is structurally similar to detla-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana, but it seems to have low affinity for the cannabinoid receptor (12815, 86533).\nConvulsant effects\nThe thujone constituent is a CNS stimulant and can cause seizures. Alpha- and beta- thujone block gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) channels, which is likely responsible for their convulsant activity (12816, 15008).\nDermatologic\nIn a small clinical study, a wormwood extract cream applied topically to the periorbital area was found to reduce dark circles faster than placebo, potentially due to its antioxidant properties (115306).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAn aqueous methanolic wormwood extract seems to protect against acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity, possibly by preventing the breakdown of acetaminophen into reactive metabolites (12818).\nPorphoryn effects\nAlpha-thujone might increase production of porphyrins, making it potentially more toxic to patients with underlying defects in hepatic heme synthesis (12816).\nSleep effects\nIn a mouse model of sleep, a hydroalcoholic extract of wormwood aerial parts increases sleep time and reduces sleep latency (107485).\nWound healing effects\nIn a rat model of wound healing, topical administration of a methanolic extract of wormwood aerial parts improves wound contraction similar to a reference drug (107484)."
