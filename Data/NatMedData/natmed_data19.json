            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Rabdosia rubescens.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Rabdosia rubescens is the whole plant. Rabdosia rubescens contains the diterpenoids jaridonin, ponicidon, and oridonin (14076, 100075).\nAnti-fibrotic effects\nSince oridonin, a constituent of Rabdosia rubescens, shows anti-proliferative effects in various cancer cell lines scientists are also interested as to whether oridonin is able to inhibit the activation and proliferation of liver cells involved in liver fibrosis. Oridonin appears to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of these cells. The mechanism of action involves the p53/p21 pathway (100074).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nRabdosia rubescens is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory agent. Laboratory research has shown that oridonin, a constituent of Rabdosia rubescens, suppresses induced inflammatory responses of chondrocytes (100077). Laboratory research has also shown anti-inflammatory effects of oridonin against vascular, nephropathic, gastrointestinal, lung, and other inflammation (100077, 100079). Anti-inflammatory effects of oridonin are possibly related to the blocking of the nuclear factor-kB (NK-kb) or p38-MAPK pathways, and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) (100077, 100079).\nAntibacterial effects\nRabdosia rubescens was found to reduce symptoms of gingivitis in humans. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, there is some laboratory evidence suggesting that Rabdosia rubescens has antibacterial effects (100068).\nAnticancer effects\nRabdosia rubescens and its diterpenoids are of interest in the treatment of cancer. In vitro research shows that Rabdosia rubescens and its constituents have anticancer effects. Oridonin and jaridonin have antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects in cancer cells (14075, 100072, 100075, 100076, 100078). In an animal model, oridonin inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, possibly by inhibiting angiogenesis (100073). Potential mechanisms of anticancer activity include antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-inflammatory activity (14075). Oridonin seems to block the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kB (NK-kb), and enhance p53 function, both involved in the cellular signaling in cancer cells. It also appears to alter the activity of various cell cycle-related proteins (14077, 100072, 100076, 100078). The effects of jaridonin might be related to the production of reactive oxygen species and induction of p53 (100075). The diterpenoids, ponicidon and oridonin, have antiangiogenic activity in cancer cells and animal models (14076, 100073, 100076). Oridonin affects the expression of claudin proteins, a part of cellular tight junctions, as well as of vascular endothelial growth factor. Both play a role in angiogenesis (100073). It also inhibits migration and invasion of highly metastatic cancer cells in vitro by a mechanism related to activity of various metalloproteinase enzymes and integrins (100076)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of radish.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of radish are the leaf, root, and seed (2, 18, 94289, 109615). Constituents include phenolic acids, catechin, flavonoids, sinapic acid, brassinosteroids, glucosinolates, and isothiocyanates (94287, 96960, 109615). The glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, which include compounds such as glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, sulforaphane, and indole-3-carbonol, are thought to be the main bioactive constituents (96960). Other compounds of interest include methylisogermabullone and the anthocyanin, pelargonidin (96960).\nAnti-gallstone effects\nRadish is traditionally used for gallstones. In animal research, radish juice resulted in an eradication of cholesterol gallstones in the gall bladder. This was accompanied by a decrease in cholesterol levels in the blood. The mechanism of action is not clear (94288).\nAnticancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that radish extract inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells, likely by promoting apoptosis (94291). Various constituents of radish, including 4-(Methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate, 4-Methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate, glucosinolate, and the isothiocyanates, have anti-cancer effects in laboratory models (96960).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that radish might lower blood glucose levels (96960, 98051, 109615). In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, radish root juice lowered both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. The magnitude of reduction appeared to be dependent on baseline blood glucose values, with a larger reduction in animals with higher baseline values. The reduction in blood glucose is similar to the effects of glibenclamide (98051). It is speculated that radish helps lower blood glucose by increasing peripheral utilization of glucose (96960, 98051). Laboratory and animal research suggest that radish contains compounds that increase insulin sensitivity or induce an insulin-like effect. The increased insulin-like response is possibly related to antioxidant effects of the phenolics in radish (96960). Furthermore, in vitro research shows that radish extract inhibits alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes involved in the degradation of polysaccharides during digestion (96960).\nAntihypertensive effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggests that radish seed extract may have antihypertensive effects. Researchers theorize that these effects may be due to vasodilation, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, and/or antioxidant effects (109615).\nAntimicrobial effects\nRadish root has antimicrobial effects (2, 18).\nAntitussive effects\nAnimal research suggests that radish seed extract has antitussive effects. Radish seed extracts prepared from dried but unroasted seeds seem to inhibit coughing in mice to a greater degree than extracts from roasted seeds (109615).\nGastrointestinal effects\nRadish root stimulates secretions in the upper GI tract, promotes motility, and stimulates bile flow (2, 18). Animal and in vitro research also suggest that radish seed extracts have laxative and prokinetic effects (109615).\nHepatoprotective effects\nRadish root might increase the detoxification capacity of the liver and increase hepatoprotection by increasing expression of phase I and phase II enzymes. Clinical research shows that patients taking a specific radish supplement along with acetaminophen 1000 mg have decreased plasma glucuronide and sulfate metabolites, and increased urinary sulfate metabolite, indicating alteration of phase II metabolism of acetaminophen. Patients also showed increased urinary mercapturate metabolite and decrease estradiol-17beta metabolite, suggesting increased phase I metabolism (94290). Animal and in vitro research also suggests that radish seed extract has hepatoprotective effects. Supplementation with radish seed extract improved liver histology and hepatic triglyceride levels in a mouse model of alcoholic fatty liver disease. Researchers theorize that radish seed extract inhibits the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis in the liver (109616)."

In rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits, urine metabolites of raspberry ketone include carbinols conjugated with either glucuronic acid or sulfate (70406).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General: Raspberry ketone, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one, is a major aromatic compound contained in red raspberries (Rubus idaeus) (13626, 17954). The chemical structure of raspberry ketone shares some similarities with both capsaicin and synephrine (13626, 17954, 17955). The known compounds involved in the biosynthesis of raspberry ketone include 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, 4-hydroxybenzalacetone, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-but-3-ene-2-one, acetone, and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase-1 (70400, 70403).\n\nAntiandrogen effects: Raspberry ketone might have some effects on androgen receptors, leading to a possible role in cancer treatment or prevention. It has been shown to inhibit androgen receptor activity in human breast cancer cell lines (17954).\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects: Laboratory research suggests that raspberry ketone suppresses the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, as well as dose-dependently inhibiting the production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 (70402). In mice fed a high-fat diet, raspberry ketone has been shown to reduce elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (19260).\n\nIn rats with high-fat high-fructose diet-induced fatty liver disease, raspberry ketone in combination with a normal diet reduces inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha, toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor-kappa B and improves regulation of the sphingosine pathway (112387). Animal research also suggests that rhododendrol, a raspberry ketone metabolite, may be the primary active constituent responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects (112388).\n\nAntilipemic effects: In rats with high-fat diet-induced elevations in serum lipids, raspberry ketone increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol (19260). In humans, raspberry ketone reduces arteriosclerosis index scores (19065). In rats with high-fat high-fructose diet-induced fatty liver disease, raspberry ketone in combination with a normal diet improves dyslipidemia (112387). Animal research also suggests that rhododendrol, a raspberry ketone metabolite, may be the primary active constituent responsible for these effects (112388).\n\nAnti-obesity effects: Feeding synthetic raspberry ketone 200 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks to rats on a high-fat diet reduces body weight gain by 5% to 9%, and white adipose mass by 20% when compared with a control (102356). Another animal study shows that feeding raspberry ketone along with a high-fat diet significantly reduces weight gain, visceral fatty tissue, and liver triglyceride content (13626). In obese mice, giving raspberry ketone 165 mg/kg or 330 mg/kg daily for 10 days produces a slight reduction in body weight gain, but a dose of 500 mg/kg/day seems to have no effect and is associated with toxicity (102357). In rats with high-fat high-fructose diet-induced fatty liver disease, raspberry ketone in combination with a normal diet reduces body weight (112387).\n\nRaspberry ketone is thought to inhibit expression of genes related to adipogenesis, preventing adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation (102356). The chemical structure of raspberry ketone shares some similarities with both capsaicin and synephrine (13626, 17954, 17955). It is thought that raspberry ketone might increase lipid metabolism and reduce obesity by increasing norepinephrine-induced lipolysis and thermogenesis (13626). In vitro evidence also suggests that raspberry ketone might increase secretion of adiponectin, which is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and in body weight (17956). Moreover, raspberry ketone has been shown to reduce elevated levels of free fatty acids and leptin in mice fed a high-fat diet (19260).\n\nAnimal research suggests that rhododendrol, a raspberry ketone metabolite, may be the primary active constituent responsible for the weight loss effects (112388).\n\nAntioxidant effects: In rats fed a high-fat diet, raspberry ketone has antioxidant effects, including improving abnormally high levels of malondialdehyde and ameliorating the decreases in hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activity (19260, 112387).\n\nBlood glucose effects: Research in rats with high-fat diet-induced elevations in blood glucose suggests that raspberry ketone increases insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (19260). However, in obese mice, raspberry ketone in doses of 165-500 mg/kg seems to increase blood glucose levels (102357). It is suggested that enhancement of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation by raspberry ketone increases production of ketone bodies which are used as a source of fuel by cells instead of glucose, leading to higher glucose levels in the blood (102357).\n\nDermatological effects: Raspberry ketone might have a role in hair growth. Preclinical research shows that raspberry ketone might increase skin insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is involved in promoting hair growth and increasing skin elasticity (17955). In animal research, topical application of raspberry ketone whitens the skin of mice. It is thought that raspberry ketone inhibits melanogenesis by inhibiting tyrosinase expression and activity (70404).\n\nHepatic effects: In rats with compromised liver status due to consumption of a high-fat or high-fat and high-fructose diet, raspberry ketone reduces levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (19260, 112387). Possible mechanisms may include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In addition, animal research suggests that rhododendrol, a raspberry ketone metabolite, may be the primary active constituent responsible for improving the detrimental effects of high-fat feeding on liver function (112388). However, administration of raspberry ketone in high doses of 330-500 mg/kg/day for 10 days to obese mice causes an increase in ALT levels when compared with obese mice not receiving raspberry ketone (102357)."

Bioavailability of the alkaloids was reduced in an animal model of type 2 diabetes (106339).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Rauvolfia vomitoria are the root, bark, stem, and leaves (93429). Constituents of Rauvolfia vomitoria include beta-carboline and indole alkaloids such as serpentine, ajmaline, reserpine, yohimbine, and ajmalicine (94354, 93444, 106339). Reserpine is found in similar levels in both roots and leaves; however, ajmaline, ajmalicine, and serpentine are found in higher levels in the roots (94354). At least 20 alkaloids have been discovered in the root. These include rauwolscine, various yohimbine derivatives, oxindoles, and isoreserpiline-psi-indoxyl (93444). Rauvolfia vomitoria also contains saponins, anthraquinones, tannins, and phenols (93438).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn animal and laboratory research, Rauvolfia vomitoria root bark extract enriched in beta-carboline alkaloids such as alstonine decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells (93428, 93445). These extracts appear to induce apoptosis, possibly by causing DNA damage (93428, 93445). In gemcitabine-resistant tumors, a combination of gemcitabine and Rauvolfia vomitoria increases the effect of gemcitabine on metastasis and tumor burden in an animal model (93445). Furthermore, a Rauvolfia vomitoria extract with reserpine removed induces apoptosis of ovarian cells in vitro and reduces tumor growth in an animal model. The extract enhances the effect of carboplatin in this model, reducing both ascites and tumor burden (93444).\nAnti-seizure effects\nRauvolfia vomitoria is used traditionally in the control of seizures. In an animal model, Rauvolfia vomitoria leaf extract prolonged the onset of induced seizures. The mechanism of action is not clear; however, there are many constituents of the plant which might play a role (93438).\nAntibacterial effects\nRauvolfia vomitoria is used traditionally as a topical agent for bacterial and parasitic skin ailments. Rauvolfia vomitoria root extract has been shown to have antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in laboratory research (93441).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe blood sugar-lowering effects of a beverage containing Rauvolfia vomitoria foliage and bitter orange fruit might be related to changes in the fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle fat (35751). Animal research also supports the mobilization of fat from stores, such as the eye (93442). Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of Rauvolfia vomitoria have also occurred in an animal diabetic model (106339).\nAntipsychotic effects\nIn animal research, Rauvolfia vomitoria root extract has anti-psychotic effects similar to those of chlorpromazine and reserpine. Although the constituent reserpine likely plays a role in the antipsychotic effects of Rauvolfia vomitoria, other constituents of the plant, such as the alkaloid alstonine, might also be involved (93439, 93440, 93443).\nHypotensive effects\nRauvolfia vomitoria is traditionally used in concoctions to lower blood pressure. Effects are related to the constituent reserpine which reduces levels of catecholamine at synapses (93429, 93431). Reserpine binds to the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (93447). Rauvolfia vomitoria itself also appears to relax blood vessels (93434).\nSedative effects\nRauvolfia vomitoria is traditionally used to reduce agitation in patients with mental illness. Sedative effects have been shown in animal research (93437, 93438, 93442)."

            "Overview": "Red clover is a perennial herb that grows to 15-40 cm in height and is used as an edible legume. It is indigenous to Europe, central Asia, and northern Africa, and is naturalized in many other areas. Red clover is commonly used in supplements marketed for female health (18, 105693, 105695).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly used in foods. Red clover has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status for use in foods in the US (4912, 10372).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in supplemental amounts.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, red clover seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Myalgia, nausea, and vaginal spotting.\nDermatologic\nOrally, a specific red clover isoflavone product (Promensil) has been associated with mild cases of psoriasis and thrush, although a direct causal link has not been established (9552).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, red clover has been reported to cause nausea (8194).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIn human research, 80 mg, but not 40 mg, of a specific red clover isoflavone product (Promensil) increased the duration of menstrual cycles in patients with mastalgia (9552). Red clover has also been reported to cause vaginal spotting (8194).\nless\nHematologic\nIn one case report, a 53-year-old female had a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with the use of an herbal supplement containing red clover, dong quai, and eleuthero. It is not clear if this was due to red clover, another ingredient, the combination of ingredients, or other factors (70419). In another case report, a 55-year-old female with protein S deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had temporary vision loss in the left eye from hemiretinal vein thrombosis 3 days after taking a combination phytoestrogen product containing red clover 250 mg, wild yam 276 mg, dong quai 100 mg, and black cohosh 250 mg (13155). It is unclear if red clover contributed to this event.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, red clover has been reported to cause myalgia (8194).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, a specific red clover isoflavone product (Medoflavon) has been associated with headache, although with a similar frequency to placebo (19545).\nless\nOncologic\nDue to potential estrogenic effects of red clover isoflavones, there has been some concern that red clover might increase the risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer or uterine cancer. A meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials suggests that increased intake of red clover- and soy-derived isoflavones may modestly increase mammographic breast density in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, adults when compared with placebo. However, in a sub-group analysis assessing only isolated red clover isoflavones, there was no change in breast density (70428). Furthermore, a 2015 review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported no increase in risk of breast cancer in females taking isoflavone-containing supplements (91725). Similarly, no effect was found on endometrial thickness and histopathological changes in the uterus after up to 36 months of supplementation with 40-120 mg daily of isoflavones from red clover extract (91725).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAndrogenic alopecia. Topical red clover has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in individuals with androgenic alopecia shows that topical application of a combination of red clover flower extract and acetyl tetrapeptide-3 increases the growth phase of hair production by 13% and decreases the resting phase of hair production by 29% when compared to baseline (19540). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although there is interest in using oral red clover for BPH, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of red clover for this condition.\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. It is unclear if oral red clover is beneficial for reducing hot flashes in patients who have had breast cancer.\nA small clinical study in breast cancer patients with menopausal symptoms due to tamoxifen therapy shows that taking red clover extract (Promensil Forte) 80 mg daily for 24 months does not reduce menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep disturbance, and fatigue, any more than placebo (102901).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral red clover is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia; research is conflicting.\nMost clinical trials in adult females with or without elevated cholesterol levels show that taking red clover extracts providing isoflavones 40-120 mg daily for 3 months to 1 year does not reduce total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with control (3375, 8502, 11089, 11091, 17091, 19450, 19543). However, a meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials in perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients with or without hyperlipidemia shows that red clover decreases total cholesterol by around 11 mg/dL, but does not affect LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, or HDL cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo (102840). This finding is limited by imprecision and inconsistency of the results and the fact that the benefit seems to be mostly attributed to two trials with a high risk of detection and performance bias. When this meta-analysis was repeated without those two trials, red clover supplementation for at least three months still shows a significant, albeit smaller, reduction in total cholesterol of around 4 mg/dL when compared with placebo among post-menopausal individuals. The meta-analysis also shows a small but statistically significant increase in HDL by approximately 1.5 mg/dL and no change in LDL or triglyceride levels (112145). Included studies were of moderate to high quality and lacked heterogeneity.\nless\nMastalgia. It is unclear if oral red clover is beneficial in patients with mastalgia.\nOne very small study in patients with cyclic mastalgia shows that taking red clover isoflavones (Promensil, Novogen) 40-80 mg daily reduces subjective ratings of breast pain and tenderness. Reductions in pain were 44% with 40 mg and 31% with 80 mg, compared with 13% for placebo (9552).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral red clover is beneficial for menopausal symptoms; research is conflicting and has notable methodological issues.\nThe most recent meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials in patients with menopausal symptoms suggests that red clover reduces hot flash frequency by an average of 1.7 times when compared with control. The benefit tends to be greater in those with a higher frequency of hot flashes at baseline (5 or more) and when higher doses of red clover isoflavones are used (80 mg or more daily) (105694). However, this finding is limited by imprecision and inconsistency, as well as selective reporting bias in some of the included trials. An older meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in menopausal patients also suggests that red clover might improve psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression when compared with control (91525).\n\nThe most extensively studied product is a specific red clover supplement (Promensil or Melbrosin, Novogen). A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies assessing only Promensil shows that taking 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces hot flash frequency by 30% to 50%, or by about 3-4 hot flashes per day, when compared with placebo (96731). The validity of these findings is limited by imprecision, inconsistency, and publication bias. Notably, this meta-analysis and all included studies were funded by the supplement manufacturer (8925, 10976, 10991, 17103, 19545, 96731). In contrast, studies with independent funding sources have not found a benefit with red clover isoflavones 40-120 mg daily for up to 12 months when compared with placebo (10975, 17091, 19549).\n\nSome research has also found benefit for menopausal symptoms when red clover is used in combination with other ingredients. Red clover has been used in combination with black cohosh, dong quai, milk thistle, American ginseng, and Vitex agnus-castus (Phyto-Female Complex) twice daily for 3 months (19552). Red clover isoflavones 37.1 mg have also been used in combination with a probiotic-rich liquid daily for 12 weeks (96730).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical red clover is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying 20 drops of a standardized extract of red clover aerial parts to the knee twice daily for 4 weeks, in addition to taking meloxicam orally, improves subjective measures of pain and function more than using meloxicam plus placebo. However, radiological and laboratory changes were not evaluated (102839).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral red clover is beneficial in patients with osteoporosis; research is conflicting.\nOne small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal patients shows that taking red clover providing isoflavones 57-85.5 mg daily for 6 months increases bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal radius and ulna by 3% to 4% (10948). Another clinical study in females ages 49-65 years shows that taking a specific red clover extract (Promensil, Novogen) providing isoflavones 40 mg daily for one year does not increase BMD or bone mineral content (BMC) of the hip, but seems to slightly reduce the loss of lumbar spine BMD and BMC when compared with placebo (6127).\n\nHowever, other research has found no benefit. One clinical study in patients who are at least one year post-menopause and not taking bone preserving medications shows that taking a specific product containing enriched red clover isoflavones (Rimostil [formononetin enriched], Novagen) 50 mg daily for 2 years does not improve BMD of the spine, femoral neck, distal radius, or proximal radius when compared with placebo. However, this study may have been underpowered due to a high drop-out rate (91524). Another small clinical study in perimenopausal and postmenopausal adults shows that taking red clover flowering tops providing isoflavones 120 mg daily for one year does not seem to slow the loss of hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine BMD when compared with placebo (17091).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate red clover for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with red clover.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbsorption of red clover is highly variable and may be influenced by constituents of food, including protein and fiber (6029, 70416). Peak plasma levels of the isoflavone metabolites daidzein and genistein occur 6-8 hours after oral administration (3979, 3982).\nDistribution\nMetabolites of red clover isoflavones such as genistein, daidzein, and equol are detected in plasma, saliva, breast aspirate, and prostatic fluid after oral intake (3376).\nMetabolism\nRed clover contains the isoflavones biochanin A and formononetin, which are demethylated in the intestine and liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes to genistein and daidzein, respectively (3375, 8193, 11090, 102840). The isoflavones are also hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases in the jejunum to genistein and daidzein (3982). About 45% of biochanin A is converted to genistein and 60% of formononetin is converted to daidzein (11092). Daidzein is further broken down to form the estrogenic metabolite equol and the less estrogenic O-desmethylangolensis (O-DMA) (6029).\nExcretion\nRed clover isoflavones and their metabolites are detected in the urine (3376, 70416). Excretion of the metabolites generally occurs within 24 hours after short-term administration (3982). The half-life of daidzein and genistein is approximately 8 hours (3979, 3982). With chronic administration of supplemental red clover isoflavones, the half-life is extended to 13-16 hours (8193).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of red clover are the flowering tops (18). Red clover contains isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, which are structurally similar to estrogens. Other compounds found in red clover include biokain A, clovamides, coumarin, coumestrol, flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin), glycitein, phenolic acids, saponins, and cyanogenic glycosides (lotaustralin and linamarin) (18, 19547, 19557, 19558, 19559, 70410, 70433). Red clover also contains a volatile oil consisting of benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, formates, acetates, methyl salicylate, and methyl anthranilate (18).\nAndrogenic effects\nIn a meta-analysis, red clover- and soy-derived isoflavones lacked an effect on circulating reproductive hormone levels in men, specifically testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), or free androgen index (FAI) (70426). A similar lack of effect on SHBG and testosterone levels has also been observed in healthy females taking a specific red clover extract (Promensil, Novogen) (70431).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro studies show that red clover has anti-inflammatory effects due to inhibition of prostaglandin E2, cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) 1-beta, and IL-6. It also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of nitric oxide (102839).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe purported antioxidant properties of red clover are attributed to the isoflavones. Genistein inhibits the formation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion and scavenges hydrogen peroxide in vitro. Daidzein also appears to possess antioxidant properties, although to a lesser extent (70438).\nAntiproliferative effects\nBiochanin A and genistein have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in vitro (4740, 70413, 70438). Genistein inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of tyrosine kinases and DNA topoisomerases I and II (3376).\nBone effects\nIn animal research, red clover isoflavones stimulate osteoblast function and decrease osteoclast activity (70414, 102839). Injection of biochanin A, a constituent of red clover, is associated with reduction in joint cartilage destruction (102839). However, a very small clinical trial in healthy postmenopausal adults shows that taking red clover isoflavones (Rimostil, Novagen) 40 mg (containing formononetin 31 mg) daily for 50 days does not seem to affect bone resorption or calcium absorption when compared with baseline (19547).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary human research shows that red clover can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood flow, blood pressure (836, 3990, 11091, 19449), and some lipid levels (112145).\nCoagulation effects\nGenistein, a constituent of red clover, inhibits platelet aggregation in animal research (19557, 19558, 19559). Flavones (apigenin and luteolin) and isoflavones (genistein) have been found to inhibit the receptor binding of thromboxane A2 (19557). However, clinical research in postmenopausal patients found no effect on coagulation or prothrombin time with the use of red clover flowering tops 378 mg daily for 12 months or red clover isoflavone (Rimostil) 50 mg daily for 2 years (17091, 91524).\n\nRed clover also contains coumarin and coumarin-like compounds. However, some experts state that this is unlikely to affect coagulation, as most natural coumarins have not been shown to have anticoagulant effects, and their content in red clover is low (17091, 19557, 19558, 19559).\nEstrogenic effects\nIsoflavones found in red clover are phytoestrogens. They are structurally similar to estradiol and bind to estradiol receptors. Isoflavones have a varying affinity for estradiol receptors (estradiol-alpha and estradiol-beta) and are capable of acting as both agonists and antagonists (3376). Red clover isoflavones show preferential binding to estrogen receptor-beta, which is found in the vascular endothelium, brain, bone, and heart, as opposed to estrogen receptor-alpha, which is found in the ovaries, breast, uterus, and adrenal glands (19560, 19729, 91524, 102901). The red clover isoflavone metabolite genistein has 20-30 times the binding affinity for estrogen receptor-beta compared with estrogen receptor-alpha. The binding affinity of biochanin to estrogen receptors is 10,000 times less than estradiol (3387, 91524).\n\nRed clover isoflavones lack estrogen-like effects in breast tissue (6127). In a cell culture of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cells, serum from females taking red clover did not stimulate proliferation or estrogen-related gene expression (102901). Red clover isoflavones and their metabolites do not have progestational or androgenic effects (3387), and conversely, they have been proposed to possess antiandrogen properties (11239). Red clover has demonstrated estrogenic activity via the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulation of progesterone receptor mRNA (9998), with physiological effects observed in animal research (70412). Two isoflavone preparations, Promensil and Estro-Logic, were found to have weak estrogenic agonist activity in vitro (70411).\nHair growth effects\nSuggested mechanisms for a positive effect of red clover extract on androgenic alopecia include reduction of inflammation, inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase activity, and local stimulation of the hair follicle extracellular matrix protein synthesis (19540).\nMenopausal effects\nRed clover has shown affinity for both mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Since the opioid system regulates temperature, mood, and hormonal levels and actions, it is suggested that this activity may explain the effects of red clover on menopausal symptoms (70418).\nMetabolic effects\nIn vitro, some constituents of red clover, including biochanin A, have demonstrated alpha-glucosidase inhibition, which might reduce glucose absorption. However, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking red clover extract (tk-16, Matsutani Chemical Industry Co., Ltd) 1.91 grams (containing formononetin 8 mg and biochanin A 1.8 mg) daily for 8 weeks does not seem to affect glycated hemoglobin, fasting or postprandial blood glucose, or insulin levels when compared with placebo (105695).\nProstate effects\nProposed mechanisms for the activity of red clover in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) include antiandrogenic properties or estrogenic effects and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitory activity (11239)."

Phenolic compounds that have been absorbed are metabolized in the liver and kidneys to methylate, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugates (99411).\nExcretion\nAnthocyanins, as parent glycosylated compounds and as conjugates, are detected in the urine and breast milk (99411).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of red raspberry are the fruit (berry) and leaf. Red raspberry contains anthocyanidins, ellagitannins, flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol, catechins, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids (13532, 13533, 13531, 70359, 70366, 105872). Other constituents include ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, chlorogenic acid, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol (13532, 13533, 13531, 70359, 70366), as well alpha-ionone, a ketone, and caryophyllene, a terpenoid (70358). Anthocyanins are responsible for the red color of the berry, and include glycosylated forms of cyanidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin (99411). Red raspberry leaves are also high in flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol, and ellagic acid (70391). The contents of the fruit and leaves vary with maturity and processing method (13533, 99411).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nExtracts of red raspberry fruit inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and lipoxygenase enzymes in vitro, suggesting that they might have anti-inflammatory activity (99412). However, preliminary clinical research in overweight and obese adults shows that consuming frozen red raspberry fruit 280 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce plasma C-reactive protein levels when compared with control (105873).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research suggests red raspberry and some constituents might have antibacterial effects. Red raspberry and some constituents have been shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic intestinal bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Escherichia coli, possibly by disintegrating the outer membrane of the bacteria (36737, 70362, 70369, 70379).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using red raspberry for diabetes. However, preliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy overweight and obese adults shows that consuming frozen red raspberry fruit 280 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce plasma glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels when compared with control (105873). In contrast, there is a single case report of a pregnant adult with gestational diabetes experiencing a hypoglycemic event after drinking 2 cups of red raspberry leaf tea for 3 days (108005).\nAntioxidant effects\nBoth red raspberry fruit and leaves appear to have antioxidant effects in laboratory research (13533, 13622, 99411). Known antioxidant constituents of red raspberry include anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and related compounds (70363, 70374, 70378).\nAntiplatelet effects\nRed raspberry leaf appears to have antiplatelet effects in laboratory research, possibly due to its polyphenol content (96300). In whole blood samples with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) stimulated platelets, raspberry leaf extract decreased platelet activation and aggregation. However, the extract had no effect on ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma or in blood samples without neutrophils. This indicates its activity on platelets may be dependent on the presence of other blood components, specifically the presence of neutrophils. Furthermore, the leaf extract enhanced the inhibitory effects of the platelet inhibitors A3P5 and cangrelor. The mechanism behind this is possibly due to direct interactions with ADP receptors, blocking the P2Y12 receptor (96300).\n\nThe extract also scavenged free radicals released from ADP-stimulated neutrophils, but did not directly affect the oxidative burst of neutrophils nor the expression of neutrophil adhesion receptors. Therefore, raspberry leaf may also down-regulate platelet aggregation by altering the ROS produced by stimulated neutrophils and reducing the ROS level via extracellular scavenging (96300).\nCytotoxic effects\nExtracts of red raspberry fruit show cytotoxic activity against human leukemia cell lines in vitro (99412).\nEstrogenic effects\nRed raspberry leaf might have estrogenic effects. In an animal model, red raspberry leaf seems to increase serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity, which is a measure of estrogenic activity in the liver (6180).\nLipid effects\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight and obese adults without hypercholesterolemia shows that consuming frozen red raspberry fruit 280 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce serum triglyceride or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels or increase serum high-density (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with control (105873).\nMuscle relaxant effects\nThe effects of red raspberry leaf on smooth muscle, such as that found in the uterus, seems to be variable. Additionally, in vitro and animal research suggests that red raspberry leaf might affect pregnant and non-pregnant uterine tissue differently (108005). Constituents found in red raspberry leaf seem to either stimulate or contract uterine smooth muscle. Research in animal tissue has identified constituents of red raspberry leaf that have smooth muscle stimulant, anticholinesterase, and antispasmodic effects (108005). When used in humans, red raspberry leaf might have either stimulatory or spasmolytic effects. There is some evidence that these effects might be dose and tissue dependent. For example, in low doses red raspberry leaf might cause more contraction, while higher doses might have spasmolytic effects and decrease contraction. Also, red raspberry might decrease contraction of tonic tissues and increase contraction of relaxed tissues (1096, 1122).\nVasodilatory effects\nRed raspberry fruit seems to have vasodilatory properties in laboratory research. These properties appear to be related to lambertianin C and sanguiin H-6, ellagitannin constituents found in red raspberry (13622).\nWeight loss effects\nFeeding a red raspberry juice concentrate enriched with phenolics (anthocyanins and ellagitannin) orally for 4 weeks to rats on a high-fat diet reduces body weight gain by 5% to 9% and white adipose tissue mass by approximately 20% when compared with a control. Hepatic gene expression is upregulated for heme-oxygenase 1, which inhibits adipogenesis, and for lipoprotein lipase, which improves total cholesterol and triglyceride clearance. Red raspberry juice concentrate did not alter overall food intake, but the respiratory exchange ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption decreased, suggesting increased fat oxidation (102356). However, preliminary clinical research in humans suggests consuming red raspberry fruit may not affect weight (105873)."

Neither the gel nor the paste demonstrated beneficial effects on measures of pain (105736).\n\nIn vitro research also shows that an aqueous extract of red sandalwood bark suppresses activity of nitric oxide synthase, resulting in decreased nitric oxide levels (105735). Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and T-cell proliferation, mediated by the red sandalwood lignan savinin, also may be responsible for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of red sandalwood (105736).\nAnticancer effects\nIn traditional medicine, red sandalwood has been used for cancer. In vitro, constituents of red sandalwood had cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines (99287).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that an aqueous extract of red sandalwood bark significantly lowers blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, increases insulin levels, and reduces homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores in a rat model of diabetes after multi-dose oral administration. Additionally, the extract markedly increases the number of pancreatic beta-cells in diabetic rats (105735).\nAntioxidant effects\nA methanolic extract of red sandalwood has shown in vitro free radical scavenging activity, and this may provide the basis of its actions in models of chronic inflammation (105736). Similarly, an aqueous extract of red sandalwood bark contains polyphenols and flavonoids that have been shown to scavenge free radicals by hydrogen donation and oxygen abstraction (105735).\nAstringent effects\nTraditional uses of red sandalwood include diarrhea and coughs. Any benefit might be due to the reported astringent effects of red sandalwood (18).\nDermatological effects\nRed sandalwood powder is traditionally used for wound healing.

            "Overview": "Red yeast rice is the product of rice fermented with Monascus purpureus yeast.

Red yeast rice contains monacolins, including monacolin K, also called mevinolin, which is identical to the pharmaceutical drug lovastatin (512, 9588, 70534, 95666).",
            "Warnings": "In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers red yeast rice products that contain significant quantities of statin-like ingredients to be unapproved drugs (6610). In Germany, red yeast rice products with a daily monacolin K (lovastatin) dose greater than 5 mg are classified as drugs (98822). Health Canada allows red yeast rice products containing only trace amounts of lovastatin (i.e. 1 mg or less daily) to be marked as natural health products (110586). The European Union limits the amount of monacolin K (lovastatin) content to less than 3 mg daily in red yeast rice products (110587).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Red yeast rice 1.2 grams daily has been used with apparent safety in clinical studies for up to 4.5 years (512, 2624, 6988, 6995, 6996, 17089, 18110, 70508, 70513) (70520, 70525, 70530, 94001, 95666, 114646, 114649, 114652). However, red yeast rice products can contain an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor identical to lovastatin, and can cause the same side effects as this drug. It is recommended that people taking red yeast rice products be monitored for the same hepatic and muscle-related adverse effects that are seen with lovastatin (98822).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. The red yeast rice constituent, lovastatin, has induced fetal skeletal malformations in animals (2619).

Two cases of alopecia were reported in patients taking red yeast rice in clinical research (17089).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, red yeast rice has been associated with mild adverse effects including abdominal discomfort, bloating, heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea or loose stools, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention or pain, and reduced appetite, in clinical trials and post marketing surveillance (2624, 6988, 16836, 70556, 94001, 114649). Taking red yeast rice with food may reduce the risk of heartburn, gas, and abdominal discomfort.\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, red yeast rice has been associated with rare reports of erectile dysfunction (70520). In one case report, a 39-year-old male developed erectile dysfunction after taking red yeast rice for one week. The dysfunction resolved after discontinuation of red yeast rice (98822).\n\nA case of cystitis has been reported in a patient taking a specific combination product (Limicol, Laboratoire Lescuyer) containing red yeast rice extract, sugar cane extract, dry artichoke leaf extract, dry garlic extract, pine bark extract, vitamin E, riboflavin, and inositol hexanicotinate (89451). However, it is unclear if this event was associated with red yeast rice or other ingredients in the supplement.\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, red yeast rice preparations have been linked to case reports of hepatotoxicity, including increased liver enzymes and acute hepatitis (16654, 54477, 94001, 98822, 112644). Since red yeast rice often contains significant concentrations of the statin-like monacolin constituents, including lovastatin, it has the potential to cause similar side effects, including elevated liver enzymes. Clinical trials have shown that red yeast rice intake is associated with mild increases in levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which suggests possible liver damage (42692, 70491, 70513, 70531, 70547, 107952). A case report describes a 62-year-old female who developed mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic hepatitis while taking red yeast rice. Signs and symptoms included fever, dark colored urine, weight loss, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated ALT levels, all of which resolved after stopping red yeast rice (112089). A small study in various patient populations shows that taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing red yeast rice, berberine, policosanol, and other ingredients modestly increases levels of ALT, but not AST (107953). Clinical reviews of red yeast rice products show the risk of liver injury is comparable to the placebo or active control group, including pravastatin or lovastatin, when taken for up to 24 weeks (94001, 95666). Additionally, in a review of adverse event reporting systems data, red yeast rice is associated with elevations in liver enzymes and very rare cases of hepatic cytolysis, hepatomegaly, liver injury, and liver failure. In many cases, the patients were also taking other supplements (114647).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn one case report, a 58-year-old male presented with complaints of chronic dysphagia from eosinophilic esophagitis 12 months after starting an oral red yeast rice supplement (Artechol) containing monacolin K. Eosinophilic esophagitis resolved after cessation of red yeast rice (104465).\n\nInhalation of red yeast rice powder has resulted in one case of anaphylaxis (6997).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, red yeast rice preparations have been linked to cases of myalgia, muscle spasm, rhabdomyolysis, and myopathy (9587, 15017, 16654, 16834, 16836, 17089, 70475, 94001, 98822)(103311, 112644, 112645, 114649). Also, elevated creatine kinase levels up to 10 times normal, suggesting muscle injury and inflammation, have been reported in clinical and post-marketing research reports (6988, 9587, 15017, 42692, 70530, 70567, 94001). The risk of muscle injury with red yeast rice seems to be similar to that with statins. In a small 3-month clinical trial in patients with previous statin intolerance, the rate of therapy discontinuation due to myalgia was similar between patients taking a specific red yeast rice product (Red Yeast Rice, Sylvan Bioproducts) 2400 mg twice daily (containing a daily dose of about 10 mg lovastatin) and patients taking pravastatin 20 mg twice daily (17089). However, in one case report, a 53-year-old patient experienced myalgia after 4 months of taking a red yeast rice product containing 4-8 mg lovastatin. Another case report describes a 50-year-old female who developed generalized myalgias and rhabdomyolysis, with elevated creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin levels, while taking red yeast rice (112306). The risk of myopathy seems to depend on the specific red yeast rice formulation and dose used (95903). Additionally, in a review of adverse event reporting systems data, red yeast rice is associated with very rare cases of muscle spasms, myalgia, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (114647).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, red yeast rice has been associated with dizziness, headache, fatigue, and tingling in the extremities (6988, 16836, 17089, 18110, 94001, 114649). A case of peripheral neuropathy occurred in a 60-year-old male with a gastrointestinal tumor who was taking imatinib 400 mg daily along with red yeast rice for 3 years (89453). Three months after cessation of red yeast rice, symptoms resolved.\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, red yeast rice in combination with policosanol has been associated with one post-marketing report of hazy vision (94001).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, contaminated red yeast rice may cause renal toxicity. Analyses of red yeast rice products have found that about one-third to two-thirds of these products contain citrinin, a mold toxin that results from incorrect rice fermentation processes (9588, 17501, 70543, 95666). In vitro and in animal research, citrinin has been reported to cause kidney damage (70482, 70540, 70542).\n\nMultiple cases of acute kidney injury associated with the same commercial red yeast rice product in Japan have been reported (114650, 114651, 114653). In one case, acute renal tubular necrosis was reported in a 47-year-old female with pre-existing mild kidney dysfunction after taking the red yeast rice supplement for approximately 7 months (114653). In another case, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis was reported in a 58-year-old female with no history of kidney disease after taking the same red yeast rice supplement for approximately 1 month (114650). In both cases, kidney function improved after discontinuation of the supplement and treatment with corticosteroid therapy. In the third case, acute kidney injury and Fanconi syndrome was reported in a 62-year-old male, with no history of kidney disease, after taking the red yeast rice supplement in combination with a variety of other supplements, for about 1.5 years. The patient recovered after discontinuation of the supplements and supportive care (114651). However, it is unclear if contamination with citrinin, a different mold toxin, or some other compound was responsible. Some batches of the product were found to be contaminated with puberulic acid; also produced from mold (114651).\nless\nOther\nOrally, red yeast rice has been associated with rare cases of edema (70508, 70520, 70525).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHyperlipidemia. Most research shows that red yeast rice supplements lower lipid levels in patients with high cholesterol. This effect is likely due to the monacolin K (lovastatin) content of red yeast rice products.\nClinical research shows that taking certain red yeast rice products 1-5 grams daily for up to 24 weeks can lower total cholesterol by up to 23% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by up to 34% when compared with placebo or control. Some of these products include Cholestin (Pharmanex), Xuezhikang (WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) , Red Yeast Rice (Sylvan Bioproducts), and HypoCol (AsiaPharm Biotech) (2624, 6988, 16836, 17089, 70491, 70509, 95666, 107951). Meta-analyses of clinical studies, which include some of these studies, show that taking red yeast rice 100-4800 mg daily for up to 4.5 years reduces total cholesterol by about 37 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by about 21-36 mg/dL and triglycerides by 20-27 mg/dL, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 3 mg/dL, when compared with placebo. These meta-analyses included various patient populations, including those with hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension (103310, 110583, 110584, 114649). Observational research in patients with hyperlipidemia also suggests that taking a specific red yeast rice product (LipoCol Forte, NatureWise Biotech & Medicals Corporation) 600 mg twice daily for a year is associated with similar reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and elevations of HDL as statins (114648).\n\nThese and other red yeast rice products provide up to 10-20 mg daily of monacolin K, which is identical to the drug lovastatin (95666). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers red yeast rice products that contain statins to be illegal, unapproved drugs (6610). In Germany, red yeast rice products with a daily monacolin K (lovastatin) dose greater than 5 mg are classified as drugs (98822). Health Canada allows red yeast rice products containing only trace amounts of lovastatin (i.e. 1 mg or less daily) to be marked as natural health products (110586). The European Union limits the amount of monacolin K (lovastatin) content to less than 3 mg daily in red yeast rice products (110587). However, the amount of monacolin K in products is not always clearly stated on the label. While some red yeast rice products available in the US contain little or no statin constituents, many still contain significant concentrations of statins. One analysis shows that that some of these products can contain up to 5 mg of statins per tablet (95903). It is not known whether red yeast rice products that contain a lower concentration of statins can significantly reduce cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, the recommendations from various clinical societies differ regarding red yeast rice. While the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not mention red yeast rice, the European Society of Cardiology recommends against its use (110588, 110589). The International Lipid Expert Panel suggests consideration of red yeast rice for certain patients for primary cardiovascular prevention, including those who are statin-intolerant or unwilling to take a statin, but recommends against use of red yeast rice for secondary cardiovascular prevention (110585).\n\nSome studies have also evaluated combination products containing red yeast rice, such as Armolipid Plus (Rottapharm S.p.A.), Cholesfytol NG (Tilman s.a), Limicol (Laboratoire Lescuyer), and Prelipid Prevention Meds, Inc. Taking these products for 4-24 weeks seems to modestly reduce total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with dyslipidemia (18110, 34262, 89451, 89452, 89454, 92142, 95663, 114646, 114654). One of these products (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.), containing red yeast rice, berberine, policosanol, and other ingredients, which has been studied in over 12 clinical trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia, modestly reduces total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and improves HDL cholesterol, when compared with baseline or placebo (34283, 89438, 92142, 107952). This product has also been shown to further lower lipid levels when added to low-dose statin or ezetimibe therapy in patients with coronary heart disease and a history of percutaneous intervention (97232, 97233). Another combination product (DIF1STAT) containing monacolin K 2.5-2.9 mg, niacin 27 mg, and unknown doses of olive oil extract, green tea extract, and various B vitamins decreases total and LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (107953).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral red yeast rice seems to reduce lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia due to HIV.\nA very small clinical study in adults with dyslipidemia due to HIV shows that taking red yeast rice (Cholestin) 1.2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with placebo (9475).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Oral red yeast rice seems to reduce recurrence of non-fatal MI in some patients.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials in over 10,000 individuals with a previous MI shows that taking red yeast rice 1.2 grams in two divided doses daily for 4 or 4.5 years reduces the incidence of nonfatal MI by 58%, revascularization by 42%, and sudden death by 29% when compared with placebo; however, there was no effect on the incidence of fatal MI (103310). All clinical trials used a specific red yeast rice extract (Xuezhikang, WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) (70508, 70513, 70520, 103310). Furthermore, all of the available research has been conducted in China; it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Adding oral red yeast rice to antihypertensive medications does not seem to further lower blood pressure.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with hypertension with or without a history of myocardial infarction shows that taking a specific red yeast rice extract (Xuezhikang, WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) 1200 mg daily for up to 2 years, along with antihypertensive drugs such as nifedipine and valsartan, does not further reduce blood pressure when compared with using antihypertensive drugs alone (70519, 70521, 70526, 70530).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice is beneficial for reducing atherosclerotic plaque.\nA meta-analysis of 20 mostly low-to-moderate quality clinical studies that included 2217 patients with atherosclerosis shows that taking red yeast rice alone or with other statins improves markers of carotid atherosclerosis and modestly reduces blood lipid levels when compared with placebo, usual care, or statins. Studies were with specific red yeast rice products Xuezhikang (WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd) or Zhibitai at daily doses up to 1800 mg or 960 mg, respectively, for 3-12 months (110582). The validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Furthermore, all of these studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice is beneficial for reducing cancer mortality.\nClinical research in Chinese adults with a history of heart attack shows that taking red yeast rice extract (Xuezhikang, WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) 1.2 grams daily for an average of 4.5 years decreases the risk of cancer mortality by 22% to 56% when compared with placebo (70513, 70520). However, it is not clear if red yeast rice reduces the risk of cancer development or recurrence.\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Although there is interest in using oral red yeast rice for CHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of red yeast rice for this condition.\nDiabetes. Although there is interest in using oral red yeast rice for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of red yeast rice for this condition.\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if red yeast rice lowers the risk of developing liver cancer.\nIn a large population study conducted in Taiwan, people who consumed a specific red yeast rice product (LipoCol Forte) 600 mg (equivalent to about 6 mg of lovastatin) twice daily for at least one year had a 9% lower risk of developing liver cancer than people who had not taken red yeast rice. The risk of developing liver cancer continued to decrease with ongoing use of the supplement, with the lowest rate seen after 6 years of follow-up (112090).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small, low-to-moderate quality studies in adults with metabolic syndrome suggests that taking red yeast rice modestly reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and lipid levels, and improves markers of insulin resistance, when compared with placebo, usual care, or other lipid-lowering treatments. Most studies were short-term and used a specific red yeast rice product (Xuezhikang, WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) at an unknown dose (110580¬). The validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Furthermore, the included studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\n\nRed rice yeast has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific combination product (Liposcudil Plus, Piam Farmaceutici SPA) containing monacolin K 10 mg and coenzyme Q10 30 mg once daily for 2 months, in conjunction with a Mediterranean diet, seems to modestly decrease blood pressure and lipid levels when compared with following the diet alone (98821). Clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome and left ventricular hypertrophy shows that taking a specific product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm Madaus Spa) containing red yeast rice extract 200 mg, berberine 500 mg, and policosanol 10 mg daily for 6 months improves lipid profile and reduces left ventricular mass (LVM) when compared with placebo. LVM reduction occurred in 57% of patients taking the product, compared with 28% of those taking placebo (103311). It is unclear if any of these benefits are due to red yeast rice, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although there is interest in using oral red yeast rice for NAFLD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of red yeast rice for this condition.\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice reduces mortality.\nA meta-analysis of 2 moderate quality studies that included 3295 adults suggests that taking a specific red yeast rice product (Xuezhikang, WBL Peking University Biotech Co, Ltd.) at an unknown dose for up to 4-4.5 years reduces mortality by 38% when compared with placebo. This analysis also suggests red yeast rice reduces the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 46% when compared with placebo or routine care (110580). The validity of the findings from this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included patients. Furthermore, the included studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice is beneficial for recovery after surgery.\nObservational research in Taiwanese patients has found that taking red yeast rice prior to major inpatient surgery is associated with lower odds of postoperative bleeding, pneumonia, stroke, and mortality, as well as a shorter hospital stay, when compared with a control group (100246).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral red yeast rice reduces the risk of stroke.\nObservational research in Taiwanese adults without a prior stroke suggests that taking a specific red yeast rice product (LipoCol Forte) is associated with a 35% reduction in the risk of stroke when compared with patients who did not take red yeast rice (110581). However, it is unclear if these results are due to red yeast rice or other factors, since patients who took red yeast rice were less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, or ischemic heart disease.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate red yeast for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nMost commonly, red yeast rice has been used in doses of 600 mg twice daily for as long as 4.5 years (95666, 103310). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTaking red yeast rice with food will likely enhance the bioavailability of the monacolin K (lovastatin) constituent of red yeast rice (15).\nStandardization & Formulation\nRed yeast rice products are typically standardized to monacolin K content. However, red yeast rice is unregulated and there is considerable variability in the monacolin K content of red yeast rice supplements sold in North America.\n\nA report that analyzed the levels of monacolins, as well as citrinin (a toxic byproduct of fermentation), in commercially available red yeast rice products determined that those claiming to contain 600 mg of red yeast rice per capsule contained total monacolin levels ranging from 0.3-11.15 mg/capsule, lovastatin (monacolin K) levels ranging from 0.1-10.1 mg/capsule, and lovastatin hydroxyl acid (monacolin KA) levels ranging from 0-2.3 mg/capsule, as well as elevated citrinin levels in one-third of the products (17501 ). The amount of monacolin K contained in 28 commercially available red yeast rice products in the US was shown to vary by more than 60-fold (95904). In another analysis of 26 commercial products, there was 120-fold variation in monacolin K content (98822). A separate analysis of nine red yeast rice supplements found a wide variation in monacolin K content as well, ranging from 0.15-3.37 mg/capsule (9588).\n\nCertain red yeast rice products claim that they do not contain any monacolin K; however, it is unclear if these statements are accurate. These products instead state that they are standardized to other active ingredients, such as monascin 3 mg and ankaflavin 1.5 mg per 500 mg capsule (104380, 104381, 104382).",

Red yeast rice supplements are different than red yeast rice sold in Chinese grocery stores (6994). Supplements are manufactured by culturing M. purpureus on rice at carefully-controlled temperature and growing conditions to increase the concentration of mevinic acids (6994, 70504). Red yeast rice contains ten mevinic acids, also known as monacolins, with the most abundant being lovastatin (also referred to as monacolin K or mevinolin) (512, 2624, 6988, 9588). Other mevinic acids include dihydromonacolin K; monacolins J, L, M, and X; dehydromonacolin K; dihydromonacolin L; mevastatin; and 3alpha-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L (70480, 70458).\n\nRed yeast rice also contains sterols, including ergosterol, beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and sapogenin; isoflavones and isoflavone glycosides; polyketides; and monounsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and trace elements (2624, 6988, 112090, 112306).\n\nRed yeast rice also contains pigments such as rubropunctamine, monascorubramine, rubropunctatin, monascorubrin, and ankaflavin (70458, 70463, 70467, 70489, 70507, 70572, 112090). These pigments allow for red yeast rice to be used as a natural red food colorant. Yellow and orange anka pigments have also been found (70462).\n\nThe toxin citrinin has been found at measurable concentrations in some red yeast rice preparations (9588, 17501, 70458).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome clinical research shows that red yeast rice can decrease levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in some patients (70479, 70483, 70519, 70546, 107952). Red yeast rice may also inhibit inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are often overexpressed in patients with inflammatory conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (70527).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro evidence suggests that the red yeast rice constituent ankaflavin inhibits cancer progression by increasing apoptosis (70485). Other in vitro research suggests that the red yeast rice constituent monacolin K (lovastatin) inhibits cancer cell proliferation (70506).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research suggests that oral consumption of red yeast rice decreases plasma glucose and increases plasma insulin (70503, 70497). However, other animal research has shown that red yeast rice can increase blood glucose (70487).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that red yeast rice pigments, including rubropunctatin and monascorubrin, have antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against Candida pseudotropicalis (70463). These microbial species have been known to cause disease in immunocompromised patients.\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research suggests that red yeast rice may increase exercise endurance by reducing exercise-induced oxidative stress (70487). The antioxidant activity of red yeast rice has been attributed to its tannin content (70471).\nCardiovascular effects\nRed yeast rice contains 10 mevinic acids, also known as monacolins. These compounds, which naturally constitute about 0.4% of red yeast rice, competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, blocking cholesterol biosynthesis (512, 2624). Red yeast rice also contains sterols, including beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and sapogenin; isoflavones and isoflavone glycosides; and monounsaturated fatty acids (2624, 6988, 6996). These phytosterol compounds, isoflavones, and fatty acids may inhibit cholesterol absorption or increase the clearance of cholesterol from the circulation (70559).\n\nSome evidence suggests that red yeast rice can increase the number and improve the function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPCs) (70521). CEPCs are believed to help protect and repair vascular endothelium.\n\nRed yeast rice may also improve cardiovascular status by improving left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular diastolic function (34262, 70519, 70526), as well as increasing flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (34262, 70479, 70526). These effects have been attributed to anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of red yeast rice (70479).\nImmune effects\nIn vitro evidence shows that monascin and ankaflavin, two red yeast rice pigments, suppress the activity of splenocytes, reducing the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM (70463, 70544).\nWeight loss effects\nIn vitro evidence shows that red yeast rice can suppress adipogenesis by downregulating adipogenic transcription factors and gene expression (70481). Adipocyte differentiation is related to the occurrence and advancement of obesity."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals, rehmannia is rapidly absorbed and reaches a peak concentration 0.75 hours after administration (112822).\nDistribution\nIn animals, rehmannia and its metabolites are widely distributed at the highest concentrations in the stomach, large intestine, bladder, and kidney (112822).\nMetabolism\nIn animals, rehmannia metabolism is mediated by intestinal flora into a hemiacetal hydroxyl structure containing aglycone. This structure is rapidly converted into a dialdehyde, which undergoes condensation reactions to produce 2 metabolites (112822).\nExcretion\nIn animals, rehmannia is mostly excreted as the parent compound in urine 168 hours after ingestion. Two uncharacterized metabolites are excreted in the feces (112822).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of rehmannia are the root and above ground parts. Over 70 compounds have been identified in rehmannia. These include iridoid compounds, saccharides, flavonoids, amino acids, organic acids, triterpenes such as ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, furans, monoterpenoids, and micronutrients, including chromium, manganese, and zinc (93668, 104272). Catalpol, an iridoid monosaccharide glycoside, is the primary active constituent of rehmannia root. Glycoside A, an iridoid disaccharide glycoside, is another important constituent within rehmannia root (93668).\nAnti-allergy effects\nAnimal research shows that steamed rehmannia root extract reduces histamine levels and immediate-type allergic skin reactions (15060).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that steamed rehmannia root extract inhibits secretion of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting possible anti-inflammatory activity (15059).\nAntidiabetic effects\nRehmannia roots are thought to have hypoglycemic effects (93668). These effects may be due to stachyose and manninotriose, oligosaccharides found in rehmannia root. In animal models of diabetes, these constituents decreases blood glucose by increasing hepatic glycogen content and decreasing glucose-6-phosphatase activity (15061). In another animal model of diabetes, rehmannia inhibits weight loss, reduces fasting blood glucose, improves insulin resistance, and increases glucose uptake in insulin-resistant hepatocytes. Researchers theorize that rehmannia regulates pathways involved in diabetes pathogenesis. Rehmannia upregulates transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, which prevents early apoptosis and is implicated in adipose accumulation, energy expenditure through lipolysis, and oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia. Rehmannia also downregulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, which is implicated in insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, early apoptosis, and oxidative stress (112824).\nAntihypertensive effects\nLaboratory research shows that rehmannia root extract inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which correlates with a reduction in blood pressure seen in hypertensive rats. These effects may be due to ursolic acid and oleanolic acid (104272).\nAntitumor properties\nAnimal and in vitro research show that low molecular weight polysaccharides from rehmannia exhibit antitumor activity, possibly by increasing the expression of p53, a tumor suppressing protein (70702, 93668).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using rehmannia for osteoporosis (93668). Animal research shows that rehmannia root extracts can increase markers of osteoblastic bone building activity and decrease markers of osteoclastic activity (15058).\nDrug metabolism effects\nIn vitro research shows that rehmannia has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 at very high concentrations. The concentrations required for this activity make clinically significant drug-supplement interactions unlikely (93663, 93666). Additional in vitro research shows that rehmannia might induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4; however, the concentration at which this induction occurs is unclear (93665).\nEndocrine effects\nPreliminary clinical evidence shows that rehmannia might improve symptoms in patients with postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, or Sheehan's syndrome, possibly by stimulating the hypothalamic-pituitary system (70711).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that rehmannia has anti-ulcer effects (93668). In an animal model of ulcerative colitis, pretreatment with rehmannia improves disease-activity index and ameliorates weight loss, colonic mucosal damage, and colon shortening. Rehmannia also strengthens tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells and increases the expression of tight junction proteins occludin-1 and ZO-1, but not claudin-1. Rehmannia inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, thereby reducing overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, all of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of colitis. Rehmannia also improves the quantity and diversity richness of intestinal microbiota damaged by colitis (112825).\nHematological properties\nAnimal research shows that rehmannia root improves the viscosity of blood, which might increase tissue perfusion and decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease (70715, 93668). The mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nImmune effects\nRehmannia root may have immunomodulatory activity. Some constituents of rehmannia are believed to have immune-stimulating effects, while others are considered immunosuppressive (93668). Constituents believed to have immunosuppressive activity include jionosides A1 and B1, acetoside, isoacteoside, cistanosides A and F, echinacoside, and purpureaside C (15057, 15059).\nNeurological effects\nAnimal and in vitro research shows that rehmannia might have neuroprotective effects (93668, 104273). In laboratory research, rehmannia increases gene expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which might have benefit in dementia (70709). Additional animal research shows that rehmannia root extract reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety following ovariectomy in mice by replenishing depleted neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate (104273)."

Oral reishi mushroom has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with recurrent genital herpes shows that taking 4.4 grams of a mixture of hot water extracts of reishi mushroom, terminalia, Job's tears, Wisteria floribunda, Trapa natans, and Elfvingia applanata orally once daily for 2 days, then 2.2 grams daily thereafter until outbreak resolution, decreases the time to outbreak resolution by 6 days when compared with previous outbreaks (91434).\nless\nGulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral reishi mushroom is beneficial for Gulf war syndrome.\nA very small exploratory clinical trial in adults with Gulf war syndrome shows that taking reishi mushroom extract (JHS Natural Products, Mushroom Science) 1600 mg in two divided doses daily for 30 days does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo. Also, symptoms modestly worsened after an additional 30 days of treatment at a dose of 3200 mg daily (108311).\nless\nHepatitis B. One small clinical study suggests that a specific reishi mushroom extract may reduce hepatitis B activity and improve liver function.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific reishi mushroom extract (Ganopoly, Encore International Co.) 1800 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of hepatitis B viral DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen, which are markers of hepatitis B activity, and normalizes aminotransferase levels in a greater percentage of patients when compared with placebo (70799).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Oral reishi mushroom has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with recurrent herpes labialis shows that taking 4.4 grams of a mixture of hot water extracts of reishi mushroom, terminalia, Job's tears, Wisteria floribunda, Trapa natans, and Elfvingia applanata orally once daily for 2 days, then 2.2 grams daily thereafter until outbreak resolution, decreases the time to outbreak resolution by almost 4 days when compared with previous outbreaks (91434).\nless\nHerpes zoster (shingles). Although there has been interest in using oral reishi mushroom for herpes zoster, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of reishi mushroom for this purpose.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). Oral reishi mushroom has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral HPV shows that taking a combination of reishi and coriolus mushroom powders, 400 mg orally daily for 2 months, clears HPV in 88% of patients when compared with baseline (91433). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypertension. Limited research suggests that oral reishi mushroom may be beneficial in some types of hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking reishi mushroom extract 1440 mg daily for 12 weeks does not lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension (70776). However, in other clinical research, taking reishi mushroom extract 330-1440 mg daily for 1-6 months reduces blood pressure in patients with stage II or essential hypertension, but not in those with mild hypertension or diabetes (70786, 70802, 91435).\nless\nInfluenza. Although there has been interest in using reishi mushroom for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of reishi mushroom for this purpose.\nInsomnia.

Small clinical studies suggest that oral reishi mushroom does not reduce the size of lung tumors.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that taking reishi mushroom does not reduce the size of lung tumors. However, it may stimulate immune function and improve quality of life in lung cancer patients when compared with control (70779).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral reishi mushroom for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of reishi mushroom for this purpose.\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if oral reishi mushroom is beneficial for improving psychological well-being.\nA small clinical study conducted in India in sedentary young adults shows that taking reishi mushroom 1000 mg daily for 30 days improves a measure of overall psychological well-being when compared with placebo or a lower dose of reishi mushroom of 500 mg daily (116137).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral reishi mushroom has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with active RA who are taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs shows that taking reishi mushroom extract 4 grams in combination with San Miao San (containing 2.4 grams each of atractylodes, phellodendron, and Achyranthes bidentata) daily for 24 weeks does not increase the percentage of patients achieving a 20% response based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or modify blood markers of disease and inflammation when compared with placebo (70767).\nless\nStress. Although there has been interest in using oral reishi mushroom for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of reishi mushroom for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate reishi mushroom for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nReishi mushroom is typically used in doses of 1400-5400 mg daily, usually in divided doses. Extracts of reishi mushroom have also been used in lower doses (e.g., 6 mg daily). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nReishi mushroom supplements commercially available in the United States are not standardized and have inconsistent labeling. Of 19 tested products, only 26% contained the labeled amount of reishi mushroom. In 68% of tested products, polysaccharide fillers were found in place of the active ingredient (97941).\n\nIn clinical research, extracts or powder of reishi mushroom has been used (70779, 91433). Reishi mushroom extracts have been prepared using hot water or ethanol.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of reishi mushroom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of reishi mushrooms are the fruiting body and mycelium. Active constituents are primarily polysaccharides, including beta-glucans, and triterpenes, including ganoderic acid (5477, 5480, 15021, 15125, 70726, 70735, 70771, 70776, 97941). Other potential active constituents include the lanostanoids (70736, 70768) and lectins (70791).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn advanced cancer patients, reishi mushroom polysaccharides seem to stimulate immune function. A specific reishi mushroom polysaccharide extract (Ganopoly, Encore International) 1800 mg daily increases interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma (5483). It seems to decrease IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It also seems to significantly increase the mean number of CD56 cells, and natural killer (NK) cell activity (15125). Triterpenoids from reishi mushroom are also thought to have potential immunomodulating, antitumor, and antioxidant activities (15021, 102915). Reishi mushroom polysaccharides such as beta-glucans are suspected to have antitumor activity (5483, 15021, 102915).\n\nReishi mushroom extracts also seem to inhibit proliferation of several human cancer cell lines in vitro, including lymphocytic leukemia, lung carcinoma, hepatoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and bladder cancer. These extracts may have direct cytotoxic activity against hepatoma, cervical cancer, mouse and murine sarcoma, and human breast cancer cells (15021). In animal models, reishi mushroom seems to inhibit the growth of tumors including hepatoma and sarcoma (15021, 102915). The lanostanoid constituents of reishi appear to have direct effects on apoptosis of cancer cells in laboratory research (91440). Reishi extracts and constituents have been shown to induce apoptosis, at least in some cases by inducing certain cytokine or other mediators (5483, 70740, 70753).\n\nPolysaccharide-peptides extracted from reishi mushroom might also reduce angiogenesis in vitro (15021). Reishi extract appears to inhibit the migration of cancer cells in laboratory research (70741, 70746).\n\nPolysaccharides from reishi mushroom also seem to stimulate glutathione S-transferase activity, suggesting that it could have a potential role in detoxification reactions (5484, 70725).\nAntibiotic effects\nReishi mushroom water extract has some antibacterial activity in vitro. It appears to be most active against Micrococcus luteus. When combined with cefazolin, it seems to have synergistic activity against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella oxytoca (5490).\nAntioxidant effects\nSeveral constituents are thought to be responsible for the antioxidant properties of reishi mushroom. These include polysaccharides, polysaccharide-peptide complexes, and polyphenols. Reishi mushroom peptides seem to be the most potent antioxidant constituents (13236). Triterpenoids from reishi mushroom are also thought to have antioxidant activity (15021).\nAntiplatelet effects\nThe effect of reishi mushroom on platelet aggregation is not clear. Reishi mushroom extracts contain high levels of adenosine, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation; however, this does not appear to be enough to inhibit platelet aggregation in human research (5478). There are several studies suggesting that reishi extracts and constituents inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro (5476, 70729, 70785). However, evidence in humans is mixed. Early evidence suggested that people taking reishi mushroom 1 gram three times daily for 2 weeks had reduced platelet aggregation (5476). In another study, patients taking 1.5 grams daily for 4 weeks did not have reduced platelet aggregation (13235). The reason for the discrepancy in results could be due to different doses used.\nAntiviral effects\nProtease inhibitors and other anti-HIV substances have been found in reishi mushrooms. These include the constituents ganoderic acid and ganolucidic acid (5479, 5480, 5481). Studies of these compounds have not been performed in humans with HIV/AIDS. Protein-bound polysaccharides isolated from reishi have been shown to inhibit herpes simplex viruses in laboratory research, possibly by inhibiting attachment to, and penetration of cells (70730). Triterpenoids, including lucidenic and ganoderic acids, have also inhibited the induction of the early antigen to Epstein-Barr Virus in vitro (70748).\nBlood pressure-lowering effects\nReishi constituents might affect blood pressure. In animal models, a water extract of reishi mushroom seems to decrease both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is thought that it decreases blood pressure by inhibiting sympathetic nervous activity (5488). Another possible mechanism is the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by the constituent terpenoids (70783). However, the blood pressure-lowering effect of reishi mushroom in humans is inconsistent (70776, 70786, 70802, 91435).\nGlucose effects\nReishi might have effects on insulin and blood glucose. In animal models, a reishi mushroom glycan, ganoderan B seems to decrease plasma insulin levels and glycogen liver content. It also seems to increase the activity of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It seems to decrease glucose-6-phosphate and glycogen synthetase activity (5487). Reishi extracts and constituents have also been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in various animal models (70769, 70781). However, in human research, taking a reishi mushroom product does not reduce fasting glucose levels, and its effects on glycated hemoglobin are not consistent (70776, 70801, 91435).\nHepatic effects\nAn ether fraction of reishi mushroom extract seems to inhibit beta-glucuronidase and protect against carbon tetrachloride liver damage. The active constituent may be ganoderenic acid A (5489). In an animal cirrhotic model, polysaccharides isolated from reishi mushroom decreased levels of liver enzymes in the blood, suggesting hepatoprotective effects (70792). However, hepatotoxic effects of reishi mushroom powder have been reported in two case reports (70766).\nImmunologic effects\nReishi mushroom extract appears to reduce peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation in vitro (5482). Constituents of reishi mushroom may also affect immune system response. The reishi mushroom protein, ling zhi-8 (LZ-8) seems to have an immunosuppressive effect in vivo by reducing antibody response to antigens (5492, 70790). In humans, reishi mushroom extract prevented white blood cell depletion and improved T cell counts (70779).\n\nThe immune effects of reishi mushroom polysaccharides may play a role in their anti-cancer effects (5483, 15021). They seem to stimulate cytokine production from macrophages and T lymphocytes. These polysaccharides increase interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in macrophage cultures. They also seem to increase release of interferon-gamma from T-lymphocytes (5483). Triterpenoids from reishi mushroom are also thought to have potential antitumor and immunomodulatory effects (15021).\nProstate effects\nIn clinical research, reishi mushroom extract has been used to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). It is possible that these benefits are related to the inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone (91436, 91437)."

            "Overview": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring hydroxystilbene, a type of polyphenol. It exists in nature as cis- and trans- stereoisomers. The trans form of resveratrol appears to be the active form. Resveratrol is primarily found in red wine, red grape skins, purple grape juice, mulberries, and in smaller amounts in peanuts (513, 2030, 2956). Other sources include eucalyptus, spruce, and Bauhinia racemose (2030). Trans-resveratrol is found in blueberries, bilberries, and the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum (Hu Zhang) (2030, 15154, 16053, 109164).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts found in foods (2030).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when taken orally in doses of up to 1500 mg daily for up to 3 months (71066, 71097, 91328, 91331, 95825, 95833, 98910, 100695, 105183, 109163, 109167). Higher doses of 2000-3000 mg daily have been well tolerated when taken for 2-6 months, but are more likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects (91327, 98908). ...when used topically for up to 30 days (71064). ...when used as an intranasal spray for up to 4 weeks (97339).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts found in foods.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used as an intranasal spray for up to 2 months in children 4 years of age and older (91332). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of resveratrol when used by mouth in larger amounts as medicine.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts found in foods (2030). Resveratrol is found in grape skins, grape juice, wine, and other food sources. However, wine should not be used as a source of resveratrol during pregnancy and lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nIn foods, resveratrol is well tolerated. When used orally in higher doses, as well as topically or intranasally, resveratrol seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and loose stools.\nDermatologic\nOrally, there is one case of a pruritic skin rash that occurred in a clinical trial. The rash resolved two weeks after stopping resveratrol (109163).\n\nTopically, a case of allergic contact dermatitis has been reported after applying a facial cream (Resveratrol BE, Skinceuticals) containing aqueous resveratrol 1% in combination with Baikal skullcap root extract 0.5%. Patch testing identified a positive reaction to both ingredients (110024).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, mild gastrointestinal discomfort with increased diarrhea or loose stools has been reported, especially when resveratrol is taken in doses of 2.5-5 grams daily (71042, 71052, 91327, 95830, 109163, 109164, 109167).\nless\nHematologic\nIn one clinical study, a patient developed severe febrile leukopenia and thrombocytopenia after taking oral resveratrol 500 mg three times daily for 10 days.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Intranasal resveratrol seems to be beneficial for reducing allergic rhinitis symptoms in adults and children.\nSome clinical research shows that intranasal resveratrol with carboxymethyl-beta-glucan can improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (91332, 97339). One clinical study in adults with allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.1% three times daily for 4 weeks reduces nasal symptoms and improves quality of life scores when compared with placebo (97339). A study in children aged 4-17 years with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.05% three times daily for 2 months improves itching, sneezing, runny nose, and nasal obstruction and reduces use of rescue medication when compared with placebo (91332).\nless\nObesity. Oral resveratrol seems to be beneficial for weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity. However, it is unlikely to be beneficial for improving most metabolic parameters in this population.\nA meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials shows that taking resveratrol modestly decreases body weight by 0.5 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.17 kg/m2, and waist circumference by 0.8 cm when compared with placebo or no intervention. This analysis included studies of individuals with normal weight, overweight, and obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or other chronic conditions. A subgroup analysis suggests that individuals with obesity have a greater response to resveratrol. In these individuals, taking resveratrol 8-3000 mg daily resulted in an average weight reduction of 1.15 kg and a BMI reduction of 0.3 kg/m2 when compared with placebo. The greatest impact on body weight and BMI occurred with resveratrol doses of no more than 500 mg daily and treatment durations of at least 3 months (100696). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for CVD prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of CVD when compared with a lower dietary intake (91334). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for CVD (91333). While one preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 10 mg daily for 3 months improves left ventricular function by about 1% and endothelial function when compared to baseline in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, the improvements are very small and blood pressure and markers of inflammation do not appear to be improved (91330).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for hypercholesterolemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving blood lipids when compared with placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), angina, and dyslipidemia (105181). Although there was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL, resveratrol did not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides (105181). Also, an analysis of results from clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease (91333). Also, clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B (112944).\n\nAnother meta-analysis identified more promising results; however, any effect on blood lipids may not be considered clinically significant. This meta-analysis included 17 clinical studies enrolling 968 participants with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, overweight or obesity, or stroke. Resveratrol reduced total cholesterol by approximately 10 mg/dL, LDL by approximately 6 mg/dL, and triglycerides by approximately 9 mg/dL, but did not improve HDL, when compared with placebo. However, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogenous dosing regimens, with doses ranging from 10-3000 mg daily for 4-48 weeks (110020).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with metabolic syndrome or related disorders (102513). A similar meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol does not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or liver enzymes. There was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL (105181). However, only 3-4 of the papers included in these meta-analyses, which included 28-31 publications, evaluated patients with metabolic syndrome. The remainder included patients with related conditions, such as overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mainly small or preliminary clinical studies that did evaluate patients with metabolic syndrome all show that taking resveratrol 100-1000 mg daily for 12-16 weeks does not improve blood pressure, glucose control, or plasma lipids (91331, 95828, 102513, 105181). However, one preliminary clinical trial shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces body weight by about 4 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 1.3 kg/m2, fat mass by 2.4 kg, and waist circumference by 4 cm when compared to baseline (91331). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, a moderate-sized clinical trial of adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg and delta-tocotrienols 500 mg daily for 24 weeks improves body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress when compared with placebo (112144). It is unclear if these effects are due to resveratrol, delta-tocotrienols, or the combination.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for most metabolic symptoms of NAFLD. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving steatosis.\nAlthough some individual studies disagree, meta-analyses reviewing 4-6 preliminary clinical studies show that taking resveratrol does not affect liver enzyme levels, insulin resistance, blood pressure, blood lipids, body mass index (BMI), or abdominal size when compared with placebo in patients with NAFLD (95826, 99048, 105184). Most trials have studied doses of 300-3000 mg daily for 2-3 months; one study used resveratrol 500 mg 3 times daily for 6 months (95826, 98911, 99048, 105184). However, one meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol might have a small effect on levels of the inflammatory mediators C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (105184).\n\nIt is not clear if resveratrol might reduce steatosis in patients with NAFLD. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 3000 mg daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks does not improve steatosis when compared to baseline in males with NAFLD (91327). However, another preliminary clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 3 months, while following an energy-balanced diet and exercising, improves steatosis, but not fibrosis, insulin resistance, lipid levels, or body composition, when compared with lifestyle modifications alone (91328). The difference in these findings might be due to small study sizes, the duration of therapy, or the gender of the included patients.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if topical resveratrol is beneficial for acne.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a gel containing trans-resveratrol 1 mcg per gram to facial skin for 60 days reduces the severity of acne by about 54%, compared to only 6% for control gel (71064).\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 75 mg twice daily for 14 weeks modestly improves cognitive performance and memory after menopause, but not executive function or learning, when compared with placebo (95827). Another small clinical study in healthy, older adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks improves memory retention, but not delayed recall or word recognition, when compared with placebo. In this study, resveratrol capsules were formulated to also contain 320 mg of quercetin to enhance the absorption of resveratrol (102511). It is unclear if resveratrol alone would result in similar effects.\n\nDespite these positive results, conflicting research exists. A small clinical study in sedentary, overweight, elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg daily for 90 days does not improve measures of cognitive function such as psychomotor speed, attention, executive function, learning, or memory when compared with placebo. Taking a higher dose of 1000 mg daily for 90 days modestly improves psychomotor speed, but no other cognitive measures, in these patients (98907). Another small clinical study in healthy elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve verbal memory when compared with placebo (98909).\nless\nAging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral resveratrol for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of resveratrol for this purpose.\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving symptoms of Alzheimer disease.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking resveratrol or trans-resveratrol up to 500 mg daily for 12 to 52 weeks improves the ability to perform activities of daily living but does not change cognitive function when compared with placebo (114517).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for beta-thalassemia.\nA small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (Xian Tianxingjian Natural Bio-Products CO., LTD) 2000 mg with piperine (Bioprex Co.) 40 mg, with or without hydroxyurea 8-15 mg/kg, daily for 6 months does not improve hemoglobin levels or affect the need for blood transfusion when compared with taking placebo with or without hydroxyurea (98908).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary resveratrol is beneficial for cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of cancer when compared to lower dietary intake (91334).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of resveratrol 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, zinc 15 mg, and flavonoids 160 mg daily for 20 days followed by 10 days without supplementation, repeated for three cycles, modestly reduces symptoms of cough and sputum production in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD when compared with control (71130). It is not clear if these effects are due to resveratrol, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCognitive function. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy young adults shows that taking a specific supplement (Transmax by BiotiviaTM) containing trans-resveratrol 500 mg and piperine 10 mg daily for 28 days does not improve most measures of cognitive performance when compared with placebo (95834).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg and quercetin 350 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve learning and memory performance when compared with placebo (102512). However, given the small sample size, it is possible this study was inadequately powered to detect significant changes in these cognitive measures.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA small clinical trial in outpatients with COVID-19 shows that taking resveratrol (Vita-Age) 1 gram four times daily, for 7-15 days based on symptom duration, does not reduce the rate of hospitalization, emergency room visits, or pneumonia when compared with placebo. All patients also received a single dose of Vitamin D3 (109164). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nDiabetes. Some research shows that oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, more research is needed to determine the most effective dose or the patient population most likely to benefit.\nAlthough results from individual clinical studies have been mixed (91329, 95825, 95832, 100695, 109165, 109167, 109170), meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol modestly reduces blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes. Studies lasted 4-24 weeks and many included patients treated with antidiabetes medications, including metformin. However, these meta-analyses have yielded differing findings regarding effective doses (91329, 109165, 109167, 109170). One meta-analysis of clinical research in individuals aged 45 years and older shows that doses of 250-1000 mg daily modestly reduce levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, and HbA1c, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. Doses of up to 250 mg daily are generally ineffective, and only one study used doses greater than 1000 mg daily. Although sub-analyses suggest that these benefits may be limited to individuals aged 45-59 years, the number of studies in older individuals is small and findings are unclear (109165). A second meta-analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that resveratrol doses of at least 500 mg daily were necessary for reducing levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, as well as insulin resistance (109167). A third meta-analysis, which also included Chinese language publications, shows that doses of resveratrol of at least 1000 mg daily are needed for improved glycemic control (109170). Some studies have used a specific resveratrol product (Biotivia Bioceuticals, International SrL) (95825). Although the reasons for discrepancies between individual clinical trials are not clear, it is possible that conflicting results are related to baseline blood glucose control. Resveratrol has shown benefit in patients with diabetes that is not well-controlled at baseline (HbA1c of 8% or higher) (91329), while results are mixed in patients with diabetes that is at least moderately well-controlled prior to supplementation (HbA1c of 7% or lower) (95825, 100695). It is also possible that the differences may relate to the technique used to measure outcomes. For instance, resveratrol appears to improve insulin resistance when measured by the Stumvoll insulin sensitivity index, but not by the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique (95832).\n\nResveratrol has also been evaluated for improving blood pressure, blood lipid, and liver transaminase levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses of clinical trials show that resveratrol has a small, but likely clinically insignificant, effect on systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. Two meta-analyses show similar findings for diastolic blood pressure; however, some research suggests that any benefits are limited to doses of at least 500 mg daily (102513, 109167, 109170). Most meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol does not improve blood lipid levels (105181, 109167, 109170) or liver transaminase levels (105181) when compared with placebo. Other clinical research in patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not affect hepatic steatosis or cardiovascular risk indices when compared with placebo (109169).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for diabetic nephropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg plus losartan 12.5 mg daily for 90 days can reduce urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios, but not serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates, when compared with taking placebo and losartan. When compared to baseline, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased by 46 mg/gram with resveratrol and increased by 25 mg/gram with placebo (100695).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with hypertension. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), stroke, and dyslipidemia (102513). More research is needed in patients with hypertension.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for treating migraine headache.\nA small clinical crossover study in patients with hormonal migraine headaches shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te Resveratrol, Evolva SA) 75 mg twice daily for 3 months does not affect headache frequency, severity, or disability when compared with placebo (109166). However, this study did not include a wash-out period between treatments, introducing the potential for carry-over effects.\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for increasing exercise tolerance in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.\nA very small clinical trial in adults with mitochondrial myopathies shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te resveratrol) 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo (109162). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nA clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking oral resveratrol 40 mg twice daily for 1 week then 20 twice mg daily for 6 months does not improve knee pain, function, or use of rescue medications when compared with placebo (115962). However, another clinical study in patients with mild or moderate knee osteoarthritis receiving physical therapy and meloxicam 15 mg daily shows that adding resveratrol 500 mg daily for 90 days improves pain, function, and stiffness when compared with adding placebo (98910).\n\nThe discrepancy in findings between these studies may be due to differences in resveratrol formulation and dosing, concurrent medications allowed, or study populations. More research is needed to determine if resveratrol, alone or as adjunctive therapy, provides benefit for knee osteoarthritis.\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving bone mineral density (BMD).\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol at doses of up to 1500 mg daily for 1-12 months does not increase BMD or alter bone biomarkers when compared with placebo (109163). The studies in this meta-analysis included various populations, such as postmenopausal or overweight individuals, or patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, a clinical study in healthy, postmenopausal females shows that taking fermented soy 200 mg, containing resveratrol 25 mg and equol 10mg, orally daily for 12 months increases whole-body BMD when compared with placebo. Levels of markers of bone formation, including osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, are increased, and the level of deoxypyridinoline, a marker of bone resorption, is decreased (112942).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for periodontitis.\nA small clinical study in individuals with chronic moderate-to-severe periodontitis who recently received non-surgical treatment for periodontitis shows that taking resveratrol 480 mg daily for 4 weeks improves plaque index when compared with placebo, but resveratrol does not seem to improve other markers of periodontitis, including pocket depth, bleeding index, clinical attachment loss, or salivary markers of inflammation (112135). The study may have been inadequately powered and too short in duration to detect a difference between the groups.\nless\nPeritoneal dialysis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol can improve outcomes with peritoneal dialysis.\nOne clinical study shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 450 mg daily for 12 weeks increases ultrafiltration rate and volume when compared with placebo in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The effect appears to be dose-dependent (95830).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for PCOS.\nClinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 3 months results in a regular menstruation cycle length in 77% of individuals, compared with 52% of those taking placebo. The occurrence of hair loss was reduced by about 50%; however, there was no effect on hormone, metabolic, or lipid profiles. There was also a small increase in fat mass and decrease in fat-free mass, although the clinical relevance of these changes is unclear (109131). A small clinical trial in adults with PCOS shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone, but does not improve weight, lipid levels, insulin sensitivity, acne, or hirsutism, when compared with placebo (95823). A meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials of resveratrol, taken orally in doses of 800-1500 mg daily for 40 days to 3 months, shows reductions in levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate when compared with placebo, but no effect on follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein, insulin, sex hormone binding globulin, lipids, acne, or pregnancy rates (112943).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for RA.\nA small clinical study shows that adding resveratrol 1 gram orally once daily as adjunct therapy to antirheumatic drugs for 2 months reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, as well as biomarkers of inflammation. It is not known whether resveratrol reduces joint damage when assessed using conventional radiography. Also, the most effective combination of resveratrol and antirheumatic drug is not known, since the patients in this study were taking different antirheumatic drugs at variable doses (95706).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol (Sumabe Company) 500 mg daily for 6 weeks reduces subjective measures of disease activity and improves quality of life measures when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis (95831). However, a small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis shows that taking resveratrol (VeNatura Resveratrol Supplement) 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, while following the Mediterranean diet, is not more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental resveratrol (113339).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Intranasal resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in preschool children with recurrent wheezing following URTI, but without atopy, shows that using an intranasal solution containing resveratrol 0.05% and carboxymethyl-beta-glucan 0.33% (Linfovir Plus, Noos srl, Rome, Italy) 3 times daily for 7 days starting with the onset of upper respiratory symptoms reduces wheezing days and episodes but not the incidence of URTI when compared with placebo (115961). It is unclear if this effect is due to resveratrol, carboxymethyl-beta-glucan, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate resveratrol for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nResveratrol has most often been used in doses of 250-1000 mg daily for up to 3 months.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with resveratrol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen resveratrol supplements are taken orally peak plasma levels are reached in 0.5 to 1.5 hours (9174, 15145, 17099, 71017, 91327, 114544). Taking with food may cause a slight delay to 2 hours (71012). However, it is questionable whether free resveratrol absorption is sufficient to exert a pharmacologic effect. Research in humans suggests that resveratrol taken orally doesn't reach serum concentrations at which in vitro activity has been seen (9174). Bioavailability of trans-resveratrol is very low, less than 1%, due to extensive first-pass effects (114544). After a single 5 gram dose of resveratrol, peak plasma levels were around 2.4 micromol/L. Cell culture studies suggest concentrations of at least 5 micromol/L are needed for chemopreventive effects (17099).\n\nPlasma levels of resveratrol metabolites are considerably higher than those of free resveratrol, but the pharmacologic effects of the metabolites are unknown (17099). In human research, 25-500 mg doses of resveratrol resulted in plasma levels of resveratrol of 5-14 ng/mL, with total metabolites at almost ten times these levels (70947, 71039). Taking micronized forms of resveratrol appears to increase plasma levels following a single dose (71073).\nDistribution\nIn animal research, resveratrol appears to increase in the stomach, heart, liver, and kidney, with the liver and kidney being the main target organs. However, levels are less than those required for pharmacological activity (2950, 2952, 70898, 70953). Resveratrol appears to be delivered to body tissues through interaction with lipoproteins (70946).\nMetabolism\nOnly a small amount of free resveratrol is absorbed; the majority is conjugated in the intestine and is found in the plasma primarily in glucuronidated and sulfated forms (9174, 17099). Resveratrol may undergo enterohepatic recirculation (17099). Plasma levels of resveratrol metabolites are considerably higher than those of free resveratrol, but the pharmacologic effects of the metabolites are unknown (17099). The trans-isomer of resveratrol, trans-resveratrol, is minimally absorbed due to first-pass metabolism, and subsequently undergoes extensive phase II metabolism (114544).\n\nAnimal and human research also suggests that resveratrol may also be glucuronidated and sulfated in the liver and kidney (2952, 52945, 70953). In human biopsy and plasma samples, resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4'-O-sulfate, resveratrol sulfate glucuronide, and resveratrol disulfate have all been identified (17099, 71050, 71052). Resveratrol is also metabolized to dihydro-resveratrol (105183). In the human liver, resveratrol appears to be metabolized to piceatannol and tetrahydroxystilbene M1 by cytochrome P450 enzymes (70872, 70943).\nExcretion\nAt low doses of 0.3 mg/kg, over 50% of the resveratrol is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. With higher doses of 1 mg/kg, about 25% is excreted in the urine within 24 hours (15145). The half-life of resveratrol is 1.0 to 9.8 hours (15145, 17099, 70947, 71017). In humans, 77% of all urinary resveratrol and metabolites are excreted within four hours after ingestion of 5 grams of resveratrol (17099).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nResveratrol is a polyphenolic compound that exists in nature as cis- and trans- stereoisomers. Trans-resveratrol appears to be the primary active form. Resveratrol is primarily found in red wine, red grape skins, purple grape juice, mulberries, and in smaller amounts in peanuts (513, 2030, 2956). Trans-resveratrol is also found in blueberries and bilberries. Raw blueberry and bilberry fruit may contain higher concentration of some constituents compared to cooked fruit. Heating blueberries or bilberries for 18 minutes at 190°C results in a loss of 17% to 46% of resveratrol content due to degradation (16053). Other sources of resveratrol include eucalyptus (Eucalyptus wandoo, Eucalyptus sideroxylon), spruce (Picea excelsa), and Bauhinia racemosa (2030). Polygonum cuspidatum (Hu Zhang), the roots of which are used in Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine, is considered to be one of the richest sources of trans-resveratrol (2030, 15154).\n\nThe trans-resveratrol content of wine is highly dependent on grape type, climate, and practices used to make the wine. White wines have very low trans-resveratrol concentrations. They have only about 1% to 5% the quantity found in red wines (15154). Pinot noir consistently has the highest concentrations of trans-resveratrol, regardless of climate. Wine prepared from Pinot noir grapes averages 5.13 mg resveratrol per liter (2030, 15154). Other red wines, including Cabernet Sauvignon, produced in cold, humid climates, such as Bordeaux and Canada, have higher trans-resveratrol content than those produced in hot, dry climates (2030). Resveratrol is not found in significant quantities in fermented grape beverages that are stored in oak barrels, such as cognac (7864).\nAnti-colitis effects\nIn animal models of colitis, resveratrol reduces colonic damage and decreases inflammation by reducing neutrophil infiltration, cytokine levels, and inflammatory prostaglandins. Resveratrol also appears to enhance colonic cell apoptosis (15141).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nResveratrol has anti-inflammatory activity, likely due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, hydroperoxidases, and 5-lipoxygenase (2030, 2948, 12482, 12484, 56943). In vitro, resveratrol may be more selective for COX-1 as it appears to inactivate COX-1, but only weakly inhibits COX-2 based on some research (15140, 15148). However, some evidence does suggest that resveratrol inhibits COX-2 (70815, 70816).\n\nSome evidence suggests that resveratrol is a more potent anti-inflammatory agent than NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or indomethacin (12483, 15154). In animal models, intra-articular injections and doses of resveratrol decrease inflammation and reduce cartilage destruction (15095, 71081).\n\nResveratrol also seems to decrease the activity of inflammatory cytokines (6126). Resveratrol reduces interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-8, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from alveolar macrophages isolated from smokers (15155). This suggests that resveratrol might have a role in reducing inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nAlthough some results from individual clinical trials disagree (95828), clinical research from meta-analyses shows that resveratrol reduces inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (105182, 105184, 109602, 109168, 114526). However, meta-analyses show that resveratrol does not reduce levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 (109168, 114526).\nAntiaging effects\nResearch in animals on a high-calorie diet shows that resveratrol can increase lifespan and improve other factors associated with a longer lifespan including increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (15093). Laboratory research suggests that the anti-aging effects of resveratrol may be partly due to the activation of enzymes involved in slowing the pace of aging. This enzyme activation may be similar to the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction (70916, 70942, 70980, 71005).\n\nResveratrol and calorie restriction also activate sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that improves mitochondrial function and increases cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to improved cardiovascular function and possible antiaging effects (112944, 117137).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in resveratrol for preventing cancer and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antimutagenic activity (2948, 15144). Preliminary research in animal models suggests resveratrol might reduce the risk of cancer. It seems to inhibit tumor growth, promote apoptosis, and delay metastasis (2948, 2958, 2959, 12482, 70961). The effect of resveratrol on cellular apoptosis differs depending on conditions. In some cases, it facilitates apoptosis and in others it inhibits apoptosis.\n\nIn vitro, low concentrations of resveratrol inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells (15143). Also, resveratrol inhibits growth and induces cell death of ovarian cancer cell lines. However, cell death appears to be mediated through autophagocytic processes rather than apoptosis (15147). Resveratrol also inhibits growth and induces apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cell lines, medulloblastoma cell lines, and other cell lines in vitro (7861, 15149, 15156, 15157, 15164, 71119, 70903, 70915, 70917, 71120). However, in an animal model, adding resveratrol to the diet does not decrease intestinal tumor load as measured by COX-2 expression (15150).\n\nPreliminary data also suggests that resveratrol may prevent liver cancer cells from invading local tissues (7862).\nAntidiabetic effects\nClinical research shows that resveratrol may reduce blood glucose and HbA1c, and improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes (71066, 71097, 91329, 105183). However, it does not appear to improve beta-cell function (71066). Some clinical evidence has attributed the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol to its ability to decrease oxidative stress (71066). Also, animal research suggests that the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol may result from its ability to modulate enzymes involved in inflammation and apoptosis (71062, 71080).\nAntioxidant effects\nResveratrol significantly reduces lipid peroxidation and organ damage in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion (15144, 70825, 70842, 70996). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia (15096). In humans and laboratory research, resveratrol appears to reduce levels of oxidative compounds and protect against oxidation (64633, 70919, 70941, 70979, 71112). Laboratory research suggests that resveratrol protects against the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and DNA (70809, 70832, 70865).\nAntiplatelet effects\nResveratrol seems to have anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects in laboratory research (2030, 2948, 2949, 2950, 2951, 2952, 2961, 15139, 70813, 70828)(70831, 70876, 70892, 70968, 71106).\nAntiviral effects\nResveratrol inhibits the replication of herpes simplex virus. Although the mechanism of this action is not fully known, exposure to resveratrol within one hour of cellular infection appears to be most effective in arresting viral growth. This suggests that resveratrol reduces production of proteins needed to regulate viral proliferation (7866). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the replication of the rhinovirus, the influenza A virus, and the cytomegalovirus (70945, 91336, 91337).\nCardioprotective effects\nThere is interest in resveratrol for preventing cardiovascular disease and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity (2948, 15144). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia (15096). In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit Chlamydia pneumoniae (15151). Systemic dissemination of Chlamydia has been suggested as a possible cause of atherosclerosis and heart disease. Some researchers speculate that resveratrol's activity against Chlamydia could explain some of wine's cardiovascular benefits. Other potential cardioprotective effects of resveratrol, as shown in human and laboratory research, have included regulation of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of platelet aggregation (2954, 70819, 70973, 71015). Resveratrol has been shown to modulate the activity of endothelial cells and nitric oxide production (2030, 70886, 71023, 71033, 71045, 71111). Also, evidence from human and animal research suggests that resveratrol may reduce blood pressure (71085, 71109).\n\nGenerally, although in vitro and animal data have shown cardioprotective effects, most research in humans shows no benefit of resveratrol on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (91330, 91333, 95835).\nCardiovascular effects\nResveratrol activates sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase involved in mitochondrial function, increasing its plasma levels, and also decreases plasma noradrenaline levels. Circulating levels of SIRT1 are positively correlated with nitrate-mediated vasodilation in both sexes, and also predict flow-mediated vasodilation in males but not females. Increased SIRT1 levels are associated with improved cardiovascular function (112944).\nDental effects\nTrans-resveratrol orodispersible tablets increase acid-resistant and antibacterial proteins in the acquired enamel pellicle, which might protect tooth enamel from erosion and dental caries (114544).\nEstrogenic effects\nResveratrol is a weak phytoestrogen (2960, 15142). It binds to both alpha and beta estrogen receptors, but its affinity for these receptors is about 7000 times less than estrogen (7865, 19085, 70901). Trans-resveratrol has mixed agonist and antagonist activity on the estrogen-alpha receptor, whereas cis-resveratrol has significantly less activity at the estrogen receptor (15146, 70858, 70863). Resveratrol has been studied for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1,500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone but not insulin levels or sensitivity compared to placebo in women with PCOS (95823).\n\nResveratrol has been also assessed for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Risk factors of BPH include family history, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 1,000 mg daily for 4 months does not affect prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), or testosterone levels compared to placebo in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome. The higher dose of resveratrol did lower dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione levels possibly due to resveratrol's weak phytoestrogenic effects (95829).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatoprotective effects of resveratrol may have been related to reduced levels of inflammatory markers and apoptosis of liver cells (91328). Resveratrol also appears to decrease mortality in animal models of alcohol-related liver damage (15094). In a separate model, resveratrol appears to reduce hepatic injury associated with trauma hemorrhage; mechanisms of action may have involved the estrogen receptor and reduced inflammatory mediators (70983).\nImmunologic effects\nResveratrol appears to have immunomodulatory activity. But the effects seem to differ in vitro compared to in vivo. In vitro, resveratrol appears to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, using animal models, resveratrol does not appear to have this effect, or affect blood cell counts or other measures of immune system activity (15152). At least in vitro, the effects of resveratrol on T cell proliferation may also be due to dose. While low-dose resveratrol stimulated the production of specific T cells, this was inhibited with high concentrations (70866).\nLipid effects\nIn animal research, resveratrol appears to improve abnormal lipid profiles (71062). Resveratrol inhibits formation of cholesterol in certain strains of bacteria (7863), but it is not known if this contributes significantly to cholesterol lowering in humans or animals. Some data suggest it does not. Clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B (112944).\nNeuroprotective effects\nResveratrol is of interest in preventing and treating Alzheimer disease. In vitro, resveratrol prevents beta-amyloid peptide-related reductions in glutathione. This suggests that resveratrol might prevent oxidative damage caused by beta-amyloid (Ab) peptide (15153). Resveratrol appears to also block amyloid beta-aggregation (71031).\n\nResveratrol has been assessed for its effects on purported markers of Alzheimer disease such as tau and Ab40 proteins. Clinical research shows that taking encapsulated resveratrol starting at 500 mg daily and increasing by 500 mg daily every 13 weeks for a total of 52 weeks resulted in a greater Ab40 marker concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid but no difference in the markers Ab42, Ab40, Ab42, tau, and phospho-tau 181 compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (95833). Additionally, clinical research shows that resveratrol increases cerebrospinal fluid and plasma levels of Ab40, but not Ab42. This suggests that resveratrol suppresses neuroinflammatory activity by stabilizing Ab40, making it less likely to aggregate and contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (114517).\n\nIn human research, resveratrol increases cerebral blood flow, as evidenced by increased hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (71039). The potential neuroprotective effects of resveratrol are also thought to be due to improved glucose metabolism, preserved hippocampal volume, and enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity, all of which have been demonstrated in human studies (102511, 102512). Resveratrol has also been shown to offer benefits in in vitro and animal models of epilepsy, ischemia, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and nerve injury (71004, 71016, 71055). It is possible that resveratrol protects against neuronal apoptotic cell death by modulating the expression of apoptotic genes or interfering with signaling pathways (70844, 71022, 71026). Laboratory research suggests that the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol may be at least partially due to the modulation of enzymes involved in apoptosis and inflammation (71000, 71032, 7054, 71055).\nPulmonary effects\nSome preliminary laboratory research suggests that resveratrol may play a role in the reduction of asthma symptoms. In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit inflammatory mediators from human airway smooth muscle cells (71048). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (15155).\nRenoprotective effects\nClinical research shows that taking resveratrol might improve glomerular filtration rate and levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, while in vitro research suggests that resveratrol's renoprotective effects may be due to inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor and preservation of mitochondrial complex III activity, thereby protecting renal mitochondria from oxidative stress (112136).\nWeight loss effects\nResveratrol appears to have weight loss effects in both clinical and laboratory research. In humans with metabolic syndrome, resveratrol appears to reduce body weight and fat mass (91331). It has been suggested that resveratrol binds to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in laboratory research (71114). Laboratory research also suggests that resveratrol may reduce the production and proliferation of adipocytes or fat cells, and decrease the production of stored fat (91338). In animal models, resveratrol increases metabolic markers in brown adipose tissue, thereby increasing energy expenditure (117137). Finally, resveratrol may also mimic caloric restriction in terms of regulating signal transduction pathways and enzyme production (91339). However, a small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 30 days does not have a significant effect on body weight or body mass index (112944)."

However, tannins are neutralized during processing and dietary consumption, making it difficult to determine the extent, if any, to which rhatany might alter absorption (2, 3, 18, 4100, 103714, 103715). Until more is known, separate the oral use of rhatany from other products by at least 1 hour.\n\nTraditionally, rhatany is sometimes taken as a decoction of 1 gram of the herb in 1 cup of water or as 5-10 drops of the tincture in one glass of water (6002).\nTopical:\nGeneral: Traditionally, as a mouth wash or gargle, rhatany has been used two to three times daily for up to 2 weeks.

The alcohol in the tincture preparation may enhance astringent effects (272).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nRhatany contains high concentrations of proanthocyanidins, which have astringent properties (2, 3, 18, 4100). Astringents precipitate the surface proteins of cells, decreasing the cell size and secretions from the inflamed tissues and diminishing inflammation. Astringents also have the ability to alleviate inflammation by constricting the blood vessels and reducing the supply of blood to the affected area (272, 4101)."

            "Overview": "Rhodiola is a plant that grows in cold regions and at high altitudes in Europe and Asia (71147). The roots and rhizomes of rhodiola have been used in traditional medicine (71147). Rhodiola is considered to be an adaptogen due to its purported ability to reduce fatigue, increase energy, stamina, strength, and mental capacity, and increase resistance to chemical, biological, and physical stressors (13028, 71249).",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAltitude sickness. It is unclear if oral rhodiola is beneficial for altitude sickness.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking rhodiola 447 mg four times daily for 7 days does not improve blood oxygenation or markers of oxidative stress when compared with placebo in subjects exposed to simulated high-altitude conditions (25402).\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral rhodiola is beneficial for epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\nPreliminary clinical research in breast cancer patients shows that taking salidroside, a constituent of rhodiola, 600 mg daily, beginning one week prior to chemotherapy and continuing throughout chemotherapy administration, reduces epirubicin-induced early left ventricular regional systolic dysfunction when compared with placebo (90434).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral rhodiola is beneficial for anxiety.\nPreliminary clinical research in college students with anxiety shows that taking a specific dried rhodiola extract (Vitango, Schwabe Pharma) 200 mg twice daily for 14 days modestly reduces reported levels of anxiety, anger, confusion, negative mood, and stress when compared with a control group. However, rhodiola extract does not seem to improve cognition (96462).\nless\nArrhythmia. Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for arrhythmia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nAthletic performance. The evidence related to the use of rhodiola for athletic performance is mixed, although specific standardized extracts might be beneficial for certain performance endpoints.\nThe available evidence for rhodiola in athletic performance includes small clinical trials in recreationally active or trained athletes. Trials using rhodiola extracts standardized to 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside (eg. Finzelberg, GmbH) show that taking 3 mg/kg, 200 mg, or 500 mg prior to exercise testing, either as a single dose or with a 3-day lead-in dose, modestly improves performance endpoints on a cycle ergometer. Improved endpoints included time to exhaustion, peak oxygen use, time to completion, perceived exhaustion, anaerobic capacity, and power (13109, 90432, 100168). However, in trials in which rhodiola was not taken the morning of testing, or when performance endpoints included forearm endurance or marathon time and recovery, rhodiola 170 mg to 1500 mg daily did not affect perceived exertion, time to exhaustion, or peak oxygen use (15574, 19284, 90433).\n\nOther very small clinical trials in trained and untrained adults show that taking rhodiola 1.2 grams orally twice daily for 30 days while undergoing aerobic training three days per week modestly improves 5000-meter running times when compared with placebo. This improvement was similar in people who also took a single dose of caffeine 3 mg/kg on the morning of testing. Changes in other measures of physical performance, such as lower limb strength and VO2 max, were small and inconsistent when compared with placebo (115673).\n\nA small crossover trial shows that taking 500 mg of rhodiola extract, standardized to 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside, three times daily for 3 days followed by 500 mg 30-minutes before exercise testing increases bench press velocity but decreases bench press repetition volume when compared with placebo (110543).\n\nFurthermore, limited evidence suggests that rhodiola extract does not affect muscle strength, speed of limb movement, reaction times, or attention span (13109) but might reduce plasma creatine kinase levels (19284). Also, while some evidence suggests that rhodiola extract can reduce blood lactate levels (19284), other research shows that it increases blood lactate levels after resistance training to a greater degree than placebo (110543). In general, it appears that acute doses of rhodiola may improve specific physical performance parameters, but neither acute nor chronic doses appear to notably improve muscle function.\n\nSome research has also assessed rhodiola when used in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in trained male cyclists shows that taking a specific combination product (Optygen, First Endurance) containing rhodiola 600 mg (standardized to 3% rosavin and 2.5% salidroside) plus cordyceps 2000 mg (standardized to 7% cordycepic acid), daily for 6 days followed by a half-dose daily for 7 days does not improve time to exhaustion or muscle tissue oxygen saturation when compared with placebo (15573). Additionally, a small crossover study in healthy, recreationally active adult males shows that taking a 30:70 blend of rhodiola and maral root extracts at a dose of 350 mg or 175 mg, ninety minutes prior to isokinetic leg strength exercises, does not influence fatigability, performance variables, or affective responses when compared with placebo (105855).\nless\nBladder cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for bladder cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral rhodiola extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults a with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection and at least 3 of 9 long COVID-19 symptoms for at least 30 days, but no longer than 3 months, after discharge shows that taking a specific combination product (ADAPT-232/Chisan, Swedish Herbal Institute), containing rhodiola extract 90 mg, schisandra extract 300 mg, and eleuthero extract 78 mg, twice daily for 14 days increases walking duration by around 13 minutes but does not reduce the duration of cough, fatigue, headache, pain, or other respiratory problems when compared with placebo (109635). It is unclear if these findings are due to rhodiola, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral rhodiola is beneficial for depression.\nClinical practice guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) state that rhodiola is not currently recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in major depressive disorder based on mixed evidence (110318). Clinical research shows that taking a specific rhodiola extract (SHR-5, Swedish Herbal Institute) 340 mg once or twice daily reduces symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression after 6 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. Rhodiola decreased overall depressive symptoms, emotional instability, insomnia, and somatization; however, it did not improve feelings of self-esteem (17616). Another small clinical study in patients with major depressive disorder of moderate severity shows that adding a higher dose of rhodiola 600 mg to sertraline daily for 12 weeks improves depressive symptoms when compared with either sertraline alone or sertraline with a lower dose of rhodiola (300 mg) (102283).\nless\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nFatigue. Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral rhodiola extract decreases fatigue in stressful situations.\nMost preliminary clinical trials have evaluated a specific rhodiola root extract (SHR-5, Swedish Herbal Institute) in various doses and populations. Taking 50 mg of this product twice daily reduces mental fatigue and improves subjective well-being in students during an examination period (1927). Taking 144 mg twice daily for 7 days reduces fatigue, but not stress, in university students (19287). In night shift workers, 170 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces feelings of fatigue and improves mental performance (6877). In military cadets, a single dose of 370-555 mg after 24 hours without sleep improves tests of mental processing and short-term memory (16411). Finally, taking 576 mg daily for 28 days decreases symptoms of fatigue and increases attention, but does not improve quality of life or symptoms of depression, in patients with stress-related fatigue (19286).\n\nOther clinical research shows that taking a different rhodiola root extract (Rhodaxon, Teknofarm), 660 mg daily for 20 days, reduces mental fatigue by 30% in first-year university students (19288). Clinical research using another specific dried rhodiola extract (Vitango, Schwabe Pharma) also shows that taking 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces perceived levels of stress, burnout, and fatigue when compared to baseline in adults experiencing symptoms of burnout. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96459).\n\nRhodiola extract has also been studied in combination schisandra berry extract and Siberian ginseng root extract (ADAPT-232, Swedish Herbal Institute). However, evidence is mixed, with one study showing that 270 mg daily improves attention, accuracy, and speed in tired individuals performing stressful cognitive tasks (19289), and another study showing that 280 mg daily for 7 days does not reduce mental fatigue or stress in university students (19287).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if oral rhodiola is beneficial for GAD.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific rhodiola extract (Rhodax, Bodyonics Ltd.) 170 mg twice daily for 10 weeks decreases anxiety and depression and improves symptom scores when compared to baseline in patients with GAD (16410). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHearing loss.

Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral rhodiola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients experiencing menopausal symptoms shows that taking a combination product (Menopause Relief EP, EuroPharma USA) containing rhodiola extract 400 mg and black cohosh extract 13 mg daily for 12 weeks improves psychological symptoms of menopause when compared with placebo or black cohosh alone (103269). It is unclear if these findings are due to rhodiola, black cohosh, or the combination.\nless\nPremature ejaculation. Oral rhodiola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with lifelong premature ejaculation shows that taking a specific combination product (EndEP) containing rhodiola 200 mg, folic acid 200 mcg, zinc 10 mg, and biotin 50 mcg once daily for 90 days increases time to ejaculation by about 29 seconds and improves control of ejaculation in about 60% of participants when compared to baseline. These improvements disappear within 90 days of discontinuing treatment. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96460).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral rhodiola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in generally healthy adult females shows that taking a specific combination product (PREMEN-CALM, Naturlider S.A.) containing rhodiola root 250 mg, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 400 mg, pyridoxine, melatonin, and other ingredients orally daily for 3 months does not improve PMS symptoms when compared with placebo (115661).\nless\nSexual arousal. Although there has been interest in using oral rhodiola for improving sexual arousal, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rhodiola for this condition.\nStress. Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral rhodiola extract reduces feelings of stress.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with general stress shows that taking a specific dried rhodiola extract (Vitango, Schwabe Pharma) modestly reduces levels of stress in certain situations. Taking 200 mg twice daily before breakfast and lunch for 4 weeks improves stress, disability, and functional impairment when compared to baseline (90431). A small study in college students with anxiety shows that taking 200 mg twice daily for 14 days modestly reduces reported levels of stress, anxiety, anger, confusion, and negative mood when compared to a control group (96462). In adults experiencing symptoms of burnout, taking this specific extract 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces perceived levels of stress, burnout, and fatigue and improves sexual satisfaction when compared to baseline. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96459).\n\nRhodiola has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients in individuals with stress. A small clinical study in healthy adults with chronic stress shows that taking a specific combination product (Mg-Teadiola, Sanofi-Aventis), containing rhodiola extract 222 mg, magnesium 150 mg, green tea extract 125 mg (providing theanine 50 mg), vitamin B6 0.7 mg, vitamin B9 0.1 mg, and vitamin B12 1.25 mcg, daily for 4 weeks reduces stress scores when compared with placebo (108672).

When administered intravenously to dogs, the half-life of salidroside 75 mg/kg was reported to be around 2 hours (71174).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of rhodiola is the root. Rhodiola contains over 30 compounds including phenlyethanoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, cyanoglycosides, monoterpenes, and triterpenes (15718). The phenylpropanoid glycoside called salidroside, rhodioloside, or rhodosine is thought to be responsible for many of the stimulant or \"adaptogenic\" effects of rhodiola (6877, 13028, 17130). Other constituents isolated from rhodiola include rhodioniside, rhodioloside A-E, rhodiolin, rosin, rosavin, rosarin, rosiridin, rosiridol, rhodalgin, acetylrhodalgin, and lotaustralin (13028, 13059, 16410, 17130). The constituent rosavin is specific to Rhodiola rosea and distinguishes it from other species in the Rhodiola genus (13028). Rhodiola also contains the tannins gallic acid and caffeic acid, as well as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids such as catechins and proanthocyanidins (13028, 13059, 15713, 17130). The amounts of active constituents in rhodiola can vary significantly depending on the source of plant material and plant material collection period (15713).\n\nEssential oil of rhodiola contain geraniol, myrthenol, cinnamyl alcohol, octanol, phenethylalcohol, and aliphatic hydrocarbons in various amounts depending on plant material and preparation (71261). The amount of essential oil contain in the dried rhizomes of rhodiola is about 0.05% (71140).\nAdaptogenic effects\nAnimal studies are reported to show protection from stressors such as cold and radiation, increased work capacity, decreased fatigue, and improved learning and memory (6877).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome evidence suggests that rhodiola extract has an anti-inflammatory effect and can decrease C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Healthy volunteers, who took a specific rhodiola extract (Rhodax, Phoenix Labs) for several days before and after exhausting exercise, had lower C-reactive protein levels compared to people who took placebo (13109, 13110). The clinical significance of this finding is not known. Evidence from animal research also shows that rhodiola extract inhibits various enzymes related to inflammation, including cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (71209).\nAntiaging effects\nPreliminary evidence from animal research suggests that rhodiola may increase life span by reducing oxidative stress (71175, 71197). Also, salidroside, a constituent of rhodiola, protects human fibroblast cells from premature aging by modulating oxidative status (71259).\nAntiarrhythmic effects\nRhodiola extracts demonstrate antiarrhythmic properties and protection against reperfusion injury after ischemia. These effects can be abolished by naloxone infusion, suggesting that the mechanism might involve an increase in endogenous opioids (3191, 3192, 3195).\nAntibacterial effects\nRhodiola extract has antimicrobial activity. Extracts inhibit Staphylococcus aureus in vitro (15720). When administered to pneumonia patients in combination with standard antibiotic therapy, rhodiola appears to reduce the duration of the acute phase of the disease by about 2 days compared to treatment with standard antibiotic therapy alone (71152).\nAnticancer effects\nRhodiola seems to have anticancer activity. In vitro, rhodiola extracts inhibit prostate and liver cancer cell lines (15720, 15721). Rhodiola extract also reduces experimentally induced mutations, possibly by increasing the efficiency of intracellular DNA repair mechanisms (3190). In animals, rhodiola extract decreases tumor regrowth and metastases in rats with Pliss lymphosarcoma following partial hepatectomy (71198). Rhodiola extracts also demonstrate myeloprotective effects against cyclophosphamide toxicity (3197, 71186).\n\nIn vitro, the rhodiola constituent salidroside appears to inhibit the growth of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as other human cancer cell lines, by inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (71247, 71251).\nAntidepressant effects\nAnimal research suggests that rhodiola may improve mood by regulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (13028, 71217). Compounds isolated from rhodiola roots appear to inhibit monoamine oxidase A in vitro (71211). Active compounds that have been associated with the antidepressant effects of rhodiola include rhodioloside, salidroside, and tyrosol (71176).\nAntidiabetic effects\nRhodiola might have beneficial effects in diabetes patients. In animal models of diabetes, a rhodiola extract decreases blood glucose and has antioxidant effects demonstrated by reduced lipid peroxidation and increased levels of reduced glutathione (15717). Extracts of rhodiola, used alone or in combination with cranberry, also significantly inhibit alpha-glucosidase activity (15719, 19495). The rhodiola component salidroside has been shown to stimulate glucose uptake in muscle cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in vitro (71193).\nAntihypertensive effect\nIn vitro, the ethanol and water extracts of rhodiola inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (15719).\nAntihypoxic effects\nThe rhodiola constituent salidroside has been found to protect neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells against hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury in vitro (71280). Other in vitro evidence suggests that salidroside reduces erythroblasts apoptosis caused by the hormone erythropoietin, which is released by the kidneys when tissue oxygen levels are decreased, and protects erythroblasts against hydrogen peroxide, which accumulates in cells in response to oxygen deprivation (71257). In addition, salidroside appears to protect endothelial cells against apoptosis induced by cobalt chloride, a hypoxia-mimicking agent, possibly via antioxidant effects (71231).\nAntioxidant effects\nMost preliminary evidence suggests that rhodiola extract has antioxidant effects, which may be higher than other adaptogens such as Indian gooseberry or Siberian ginseng (71207). In vitro evidence suggests that rhodiola root extract protects keratinocytes against oxidative stress (71233). Rhodiola root extract also appears to protect erythrocytes against hypochlorous acid-induced oxidative damage by protecting against glutathione (GSH) depletion, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inactivation, and hemolysis (71147). Animal research suggests that rhodiola extract increases reduced glutathione levels in the liver of diabetic mice (15717). It also appears to protect against streptozotocin-induced neuronal damage in rats by increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and reducing glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione (GSH) levels in rats (71241). Other laboratory evidence conducted in fruit flies suggests that rhodiola extract protects against oxidative stress by decreasing endogenous superoxide levels (71230). However, some in vitro evidence suggests that rhodiola root extract protects against oxidative stress without activating antioxidant defenses (71223).\n\nThe rhodiola constituent salidroside decreases apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide in vitro, suggesting that it might protect against neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress (15714). Also, salidroside protects against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced apoptosis in pheochromocytoma cells in vitro by inhibiting the nitric oxide pathway (71267). Evidence from animal research suggests that salidroside protects against acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity by preventing and alleviating intracellular GSH depletion and oxidative damage (71200).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that salidroside, a constituent of rhodiola, possesses antiviral activities against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in vitro and in animals (71204). Also, flavonols isolated from rhodiola appear to have anti-influenza viral activity in vitro (71234).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn mice, rhodiola extract significantly induced anxiolytic-like effects (15716).\nAthletic performance enhancement effects\nFor improving athletic performance, rhodiola is theorized to improve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover in muscle (71146). However, a study in healthy athletes found no effect on muscle ATP during exhausting exercise (15574). Rhodiola extract has also been shown to reduce C-reactive protein and creatinine kinase levels following exhausting exercise, suggesting that it may protect muscle tissue from exercise-induced damage (13110). Animal research suggests that rhodiola may protect against oxidative stress induced by exercises such as swimming and increase glycogen content during exhaustive exercises, which may improve athletic performance (71229, 71243). Some animal research suggests that administering rhodiola extract with maral root extract, in conjunction with resistance training, increases protein synthesis, mechanical power output, and type I to type II muscle fiber ratio in trained muscles, but does not improve muscle mass, when compared with placebo. Other animal studies in rats suggests rhodiola combined with caffeine improves grip strength, erythropoietin and dopamine levels, lactate levels, and rate of oxygen consumption (112006, 115673). However, rhodiola alone did not improve these measures of muscle composition or physical performance (105850).\nCardioprotective effects\nRhodiola extracts might prevent stress-induced cardiac damage by preventing rises in cardiac catecholamines and cyclic-AMP (3193, 17130). Animal research suggests that rhodiola extract reduces the incidence of ischemic/reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias during 10-minute ischemia and 10-minute reperfusion in rats with postinfarction cardiosclerosis (71227). The rhodiola constituent salidroside appears to inhibit myocardial apoptosis in rats with induced acute myocardial infarction by increasing phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and decreasing activation of caspase-3 (71264). Also, salidroside appears to decrease cardiomyocyte injury following ischemia/reperfusion in vitro by increasing protein O-linked N-acetylglucosamine levels (71216).\nCentral nervous system effects\nRhodiola appears to have significant central nervous system activity. In animal models, a rhodiola extract containing 3% rosavin and 1% salidroside has antidepressant, anxiolytic, and stimulant effects (15716). There is some interest in using rhodiola for symptoms of hypothyroidism, due to its antidepressant, antioxidant, and fatigue-reducing effects; however, this theory has not been tested in humans (17130). In animal models, the salidroside constituent also has sedative effects (15715). Rhodiola extracts also demonstrate potential for improving learning and memory (3198, 6877).\nCognitive effects\nA single dose of rhodiola before maze training facilitated some aspects of learning and memory in animals (3198). However, rhodiola does not appear to protect against electroconvulsive shock-impaired learning and memory in an animal model (71269).\nHepatoprotective effects\nRhodiola extracts and the rhodiola constituent salidroside have demonstrated hepatoprotective effects against drugs such as doxorubicin and acetaminophen in animals (3196, 71200).\nHypolipidemic effects\nThe rhodiola constituents rhodionin and rhodiosin have been shown to inhibit lipase activity in vitro, with IC50 values of 0.093 mM and 0.133 mM, respectively (71206). In animal research, these compounds also suppressed postprandial elevations in triglyceride levels (71206).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn humans with bladder cancer, rhodiola extract has been shown to improve parameters of leukocyte integrins and T cell immunity (3194). Also, taking a combination of dried ethanol/water extracts from maral root, rhodiola root, Siberian ginseng root, and schisandra fruit (AdMax) increased numbers of CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD8 T cell subclasses, as well as IgG and IgM, in patients who completed chemotherapy (71158).\nNeuroprotective effects\nRhodiola root extract appears to inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) in vitro, which suggests that it may have protective effects against MAOB-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's (71211). Animal research suggests that rhodiola extract protects against cognitive deficits and neuronal injury caused by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. This effect has been attributed to the antioxidant activity or rhodiola (71241).\n\nSalidroside, a constituent of rhodiola, appears to protect against beta-amyloid-induced oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it may help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (71253).\nSleep effects\nThere is interest in using rhodiola for insomnia. A very small clinical trial in adults with self-reported sleep disturbance shows that taking a combination product containing 750 mg of rhodiola root extract and lotus seed extract, orally daily before sleep for 2 weeks, modestly improves sleep quality scores, but not sleep duration or sleep latency, when compared with baseline (117000). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if this effect is due to rhodiola, lotus seed, or the combination."

Rhubarb, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has also been reported to cause bloating, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach upset or pain in clinical studies. Diarrhea is more common with a starting dose of at least 3 grams of extract (71315, 71329, 71339, 71340, 71341, 71342, 71373, 92300). Chronic use or abuse of rhubarb can cause inhibition of gastric motility and pseudomelanosis coli (pigment spots in the intestinal mucosa) (12, 6138).\n\nAlthough some research suggests that rhubarb and other anthranoid laxatives might increase the risk of colorectal cancer due to pseudomelanosis coli (30743), more recent research suggests that this condition is harmless, typically reversed with rhubarb discontinuation, and not associated with an increased risk for colorectal adenoma or carcinoma (6138).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, chronic use or abuse of rhubarb can cause hematuria (12).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, chronic use of anthraquinone-containing products, such as rhubarb, has been associated with hepatotoxicity (15257).

It is hypothesized that the combination of diclofenac with the anthraquinone constituents of rhubarb precipitated renal dysfunction (15257).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral rhubarb root extract seems to help improve symptoms of menopause.\nClinical research in perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients shows that taking a specific dry extract of rhubarb root (ERr 731, Estroease, Lupin Pharmaceuticals) 4 mg orally daily for 3-27 months improves symptoms of menopause by 46% to 83% compared to an improvement of less than 20% with placebo. About 83% of females taking the rhubarb extract report overall clinical improvement, with specific improvements in anxiety, hot flushes, sweating, sleep, mood, quality of life, fatigue, sexual problems, urinary tract problems, vaginal dryness, and joint and muscle issues (92294, 92295, 92296, 92297, 92298, 108960).\nless\nPancreatitis. Oral or rectal rhubarb might improve symptoms and duration of hospital stay in individuals with acute pancreatitis. It is unclear if oral rhubarb helps to prevent pancreatitis in individuals undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in adults with acute pancreatitis in China shows that administering rhubarb 10-90 grams daily via gastric tube or rectal enema for 3-14 days, in combination with somatostatin, octreotide, or ulinastatin, reduces the risk for complications such as sepsis or kidney failure by 45%, duration of abdominal pain by 1.3-2 days, and duration of hospital stay by 6.7-6.9 days when compared with taking these medications alone (97922, 100964). However, the included studies were of low methodological quality. Additionally, somatostatin and octreotide are not recommended for the treatment of acute pancreatitis by the American College of Gastroenterology or the American Gastroenterological Association (101001, 100965). A separate meta-analysis and individual clinical studies show that administering rhubarb 6-20 grams 1-3 times daily for 5-14 days, usually via nasojejunal tube with early enteral nutrition, reduces the duration of hospital stay and improves abdominal symptoms when compared with enteral nutrition alone (92301, 103475). The meta-analysis shows that administering rhubarb reduces hospital stay by 4.5 days and intensive care unit stay by 2.8 days. The use of rhubarb also reduced the duration of severe abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and abnormal bowel sounds by 1-2 days. However, there was no effect on mortality rate, infection rate, or the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction (103475).\n\nRhubarb has also been studied for the prevention of pancreatitis in patients undergoing a specific procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Preliminary clinical research in patients at high risk for post-ERCP complications shows that drinking a raw rhubarb solution after the procedure reduces the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis by 74% and post-ERCP hyperamylasemia by 81% when compared to standard care. However, this study was of low methodological quality, and the rhubarb solution preparation and dose were not reported (97920).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear if oral rhubarb reduces ARDS.\nA small clinical study in patients with ARDS shows that administering rhubarb leachate 10 grams in 30 mL water via nasogastric tube three times daily for 7 days, in addition to standard treatment, modestly improves oxygenation and reduces indices of pulmonary vascular permeability when compared with standard treatment (97921).\nless\nAppendicitis. Oral rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for use in pediatric appendiceal abscess; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large observational study in children 3-14 years old with appendiceal abscess also receiving intravenous antibiotics suggests that taking a rhubarb peony decoction twice daily for 7-14 days is associated with a higher clinical cure rate of 93% when compared with 81% in the control group, but does not improve length of stay, post-operative complications, or recurrence rate (112380). However, it is unclear if the effects are from rhubarb, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCanker sores. Topical rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small open-label clinical study in adults with mild canker sores shows that topical application of a specific combination product (Pyralvex Soluté, Laboratoires Norgine Pharma) containing rhubarb extract 5% and salicylic acid reduces the time to symptom resolution by about 3 days when compared to using a water control (97919).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral rhubarb prevents the progression of CKD or improves markers of kidney function.\nA meta-analysis of results from two low-quality clinical studies shows that taking rhubarb 1-7.7 grams daily for up to 48 months as part of traditional Chinese medicine does not delay the onset of kidney failure when compared with standard treatment (92302). However, these results were calculated using regression analysis rather than long-term follow-up, which limits the validity of these findings. Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that rhubarb may improve serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in patients with CKD when compared with no treatment (92302). However, rhubarb does not appear to improve blood urea nitrogen when compared with captopril (71329). The validity of the research to date is limited by the low to very low methodological quality of the studies and the high risk of bias. Additionally, all of the studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if these findings are applicable to other populations.\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if rhubarb is beneficial for constipation.\nA small clinical study in middle-aged adults with constipation shows that taking rhubarb extract 12.5 mg or 25 mg based on rhein content (Gutisrheum, Laboratories Ortis) at bedtime for 1 month improves stool frequency and consistency when compared with placebo (112381). The validity of these findings is limited by patient-reported outcomes. A clinical study in patients with chronic constipation, defined as having a bowel movement no more than twice per week, shows that a specific combination product (Nucarb; Wilshire Laboratories Ltd) containing rhubarb extract 250 mg, activated charcoal 180 mg, calcium sennosides 50 mg, peppermint oil 0.5 mg, fennel oil 0.5 mg, and sulfur 50 mg, taken as two tablets at bedtime for one week, followed by 1 tablet at bedtime for 1 week, reduces passing gas, abdominal pain, and sensation of bloating by 81%, 73%, and 72% respectively, when compared with baseline. Sensation of straining, severity of constipation, and feeling of incomplete evacuation were reduced by 69%, 67%, and 54% respectively, when compared with baseline (108853). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear whether the effects are due to rhubarb, the combination, or other ingredients.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral rhubarb reduces dysmenorrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in young adults with dysmenorrhea shows that taking rhubarb root and rhizome powder 2520 mg daily, beginning 2 days before menstruation and continuing for 5 days, repeated for three consecutive cycles, has similar efficacy to mefenamic acid 500 mg three times daily in reducing pain and improving quality of life. Those receiving either treatment experienced an overall improvement of greater than 80%, which is attributed to a reduction in pain, fatigue, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms (92300).\nless\nGastrointestinal bleeding. It is unclear if spraying rhubarb powder with a gastroscope reduces gastrointestinal bleeding.\nIn patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, a meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research shows that spraying rhubarb powder under a gastroscope has a small to moderate hemostatic effect over 24-72 hours when compared with norepinephrine. The risk of re-bleeding over 48 hours was also reduced by about 58% (103474).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Topical rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that applying a cream containing rhubarb and sage to cold sores is similarly effective to acyclovir (Zovirax) cream. Acyclovir cream heals lesions in about 6.3 days; the rhubarb and sage cream heals lesions in about 7.2 days (10437). It is not clear if these improvements are due to the treatments used or to the natural resolution of the cold sores. Additionally, it is unclear if the benefit is due to rhubarb, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral rhubarb helps to lower cholesterol levels.\nA very small clinical study including 10 males with hypercholesterolemia shows that eating ground rhubarb stalk fiber 27 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 8% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9%, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared to baseline (71363). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small study size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMalignant pleural effusions. Topical rhubarb powder has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients living in China with advanced malignant cancer and malignant pleural effusions shows that applying a combination product (Hehuang Company) containing rhubarb powder 100 grams and mirabilite 400 grams to the chest wall for 8 hours daily for 28 days as an adjunct to standard therapy leads to partial or complete reduction of effusion in 67% of participants, compared with 55% of those receiving placebo and standard therapy (105961).\nless\nNasopharyngeal cancer. Oral rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows that taking a specific combination product (Shenlong) containing rhubarb and other herbs along with radiation therapy does not improve tumor remission or survival when compared to radiation therapy alone (71380).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with NAFLD shows that taking 3-5 tablets of a specific Chinese herbal medicine (Danning Pian) containing rhubarb, giant knotweed, dried green orange peel, and dried ripe orange peel three times daily for 3 month improves lipids, liver function, and clinical symptoms (71315). It is not clear if this effect is due to rhubarb, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral rhubarb is beneficial for weight loss.\nA small clinical study in overweight and obese females shows that taking rhubarb with ginger, astragalus, red sage, and turmeric does not reduce body weight when compared with placebo (20346).\nless\nOrganophosphorus pesticide poisoning. It is unclear if giving rhubarb by gastric tube, nasal feeding, or enema is beneficial for organophosphorus pesticide poisoning.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in patients with acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning shows that taking crude rhubarb 9-120 grams daily via gastric tube, nasal feeding, or retention enema, in conjunction with standard treatment, decreases the incidence of intermediate syndrome by 78% and organ dysfunction syndrome by 66% when compared to standard treatment alone. Rhubarb also reduces the duration of hospital stay by 2.8 days, but with no change in mortality rate, when compared to standard treatment alone. Standard treatment in these studies included atropine, pralidoxime, ventilation, diuresis, other supportive measures, and/or mannitol (92303).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral rhubarb is beneficial for sepsis.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in patients with sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) shows that taking rhubarb powder in conjunction with conventional therapy reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal dysfunction, but does not reduce mortality rate, when compared to conventional therapy alone (92305).\nless\nStroke. Oral rhubarb has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with acute ischemic stroke shows that taking traditional Chinese medicine containing rhubarb root and rhizome in conjunction with traditional Western medicine for up to 30 days enhances overall clinical improvement by 27% when compared with traditional Western medicine alone. However, the validity of this outcome is limited by small sample size, the variability in the Chinese medicine formulas used, and the high risk for bias of the included studies (92299).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate rhubarb for these uses.",

Additionally, in a case report, a 23-year old female presented with kidney failure after taking 6 tablets of a proprietary slimming agent (found to contain the anthraquinones emodin and aloe-emodin from rhubarb) daily for 6 weeks and then adding diclofenac 25 mg 4 times daily for 2 days. The authors postulate that the anthraquinone constituents of rhubarb contributed to the renal dysfunction, and the addition of diclofenac, a nephrotoxic drug, led to renal failure (15257).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of rhubarb are the stem, rhizome, and root. The active constituents include hydroxyanthracene derivatives, anthraquinones, tannins, and calcium oxalate (10437). Rhubarb root contains 2% to 5% anthraquinone derivatives. The main anthraquinones include chrysophanol, aloe-emodin, emodin, rhein, physcion, and chrysophanol (15257, 92304, 105960). Rhubarb also contains the stilbenes rhapontigenin, rhaponticin, piceatannol, and piceatannol 3'-beta-D-glycoside (71307, 108960).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nAt low doses, the tannin effects of rhubarb predominate and have an astringent effect on the gastrointestinal tract that relieves diarrhea. However, at higher doses, rhubarb has a laxative effect (7).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn humans, rhubarb has anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of rhubarb may be at least partially responsible for the benefits of rhubarb seen in patients with sepsis or other illnesses (92301, 92305, 103475).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThere is interest in rhubarb extract for stimulating weight loss. Animal research suggests that rhubarb might reduce weight by reducing food intake, slowing stomach emptying, and increasing intestinal movement (71347).\nAntiviral effects\nIn clinical research, topical application of rhubarb in combination with sage seems to improve herpes labialis (cold sores) (10437). In laboratory research, rhubarb extract has antiviral action against Herpes simplex (71361). In animal research, rhubarb has antiviral effects against the measles virus (71324).\nHormonal effects\nIn laboratory research, a specific rhubarb extract, ERr 731 and its hydroxystilbene constituents, activate estrogen receptor beta, but not alpha. Benefits related to menopause and dysmenorrhea may be related to this pathway (92298).\nLaxative effects\nAt high doses of rhubarb, the anthraquinone effects seem to predominate, producing a stimulant laxative effect that relieves constipation and can cause diarrhea. However, at low doses, rhubarb has an astringent effect on the gastrointestinal tract (7).\nLipid-lowering effects\nIn humans, rhubarb stalk, in combination with other ingredients, has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (71315, 71351, 71363). Rhubarb stalk is high in fiber which has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels in animal models (71375). It is possible that the fiber in rhubarb binds to bile salts in the intestine, accelerating bile and cholesterol excretion (71303, 71376). Rhubarb constituents may also reduce the synthesis of cholesterol (92302).\nPancreatic effects\nRhubarb reduces abdominal pain in patients being treated for severe acute pancreatitis (92301). Animal studies suggest that the promotion of gut motility and prevention of intestinal bacterial translocation may play a role (71362).\nRenal effects\nClinical research shows that taking rhubarb extract by mouth or via retention enema may be helpful for individuals with kidney disease. Rhubarb appears to reduce blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, limiting disease progression (71309, 71312, 71327, 71329, 71339, 71350, 71359, 71373, 92302). Various constituents of rhubarb may play a role in the protective effects of rhubarb, as shown in laboratory and animal research. These include the tannins, which improve renal markers, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and renal blood flow (71355). The constituents emodin and epicatecchin 3-O-gallate are also thought to play a role (71355). Rhubarb appears to protect the kidney by decreasing mesangial cell proliferation, fibronectin synthesis and secretion, and inflammatory cytokine activity (71367, 92302). Rhubarb may also protect the kidney in animal models of diabetes (71352, 71377)."

Oral riboflavin can treat and prevent low riboflavin levels.\nTaking oral riboflavin for up to one year prevents riboflavin deficiency and improves ariboflavinosis in adults and children (15, 56780, 71494, 71518).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Oral riboflavin reduces homocysteine levels in individuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. It does not seem to provide benefit in individuals with other genotypes.\nPopulation research has found that poor riboflavin status is associated with high homocysteine levels in individuals with the 677 TT genotype for the MTHFR enzyme (71386, 71403, 71409). Taking riboflavin 1.6 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces homocysteine levels by 22% to 40% in individuals with the 677 TT genotype of MTHFR when compared with pretreatment. However, riboflavin supplementation does not seem to reduce homocysteine levels in individuals with the 677 CC or CT genotypes (71443).\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral riboflavin supplements modestly reduce migraine attack frequency and severity in adults. The benefits of oral riboflavin in children are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical trials in adults with migraine shows that taking riboflavin 100-400 mg daily, alone or in combination with other natural ingredients, for three months modestly reduces migraine duration, frequency, and pain scores when compared with control (105480). These findings are limited by significant heterogeneity. Most clinical studies compared riboflavin 400 mg daily with placebo, no treatment, or an active control (1396, 1397, 1398, 12387, 105480). Limited evidence also suggests that taking riboflavin 400 mg daily might be no different for migraine prevention than certain conventional treatments such as bisoprolol 10 mg, metoprolol 200 mg, propranolol 80 mg, or valproate 500 mg (1396, 105480). These findings are limited by small study size and inadequate power to detect a difference between groups.\n\nThe benefits of dietary riboflavin in adults are unclear. A large, retrospective, cross-sectional study found that higher dietary intake of riboflavin is not associated with odds of severe headache or migraine when compared with lower dietary intake (111684).\n\nLimited research has evaluated riboflavin in children. A network meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials in children with migraine shows that taking oral riboflavin 100-200 mg daily for 4-12 months does not significantly reduce incidence of migraine when compared with placebo. However, there was a non-significant trend towards reduced migraine frequency. Furthermore, conventional treatments such as propranolol, pregabalin, valproate, and topiramate were not shown to be significantly better than riboflavin for migraine prevention (105484). These findings are limited by small population sizes and insufficient power to detect differences between groups. Although riboflavin 100-200 mg has been used in prospective clinical studies, small observational studies have found some benefit in children taking riboflavin doses as low as 10-40 mg daily and as high as 400 mg daily for 3-4 months (105481, 105485).\n\nRiboflavin has also been studied in combination with other ingredients, with research suggesting potential benefit. Specifically, riboflavin 400 mg has been combined with magnesium 600 mg and coenzyme Q10 150 mg daily (Dolovent; Linpharma Inc.) (92101), and also with magnesium 300 mg and feverfew 100 mg daily (12389).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial for acne.\nA small clinical trial in adults aged 18-40 years with mild to moderate facial acne undergoing photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows that applying riboflavin gel 1.25% topically to one side of the face prior to PDT for 3 weekly sessions reduces facial lesions to a similar extent as topical 5-aminolevulinic acid 5% applied to the other side of the face (115686).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral riboflavin for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of riboflavin for this condition.\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial for anxiety.\nA large observational cohort study in adults suggests that a dietary riboflavin intake above 2.1 mg daily is associated with a 5% lower prevalence of anxiety when compared with a riboflavin intake less than 1.6 mg daily. Subgroup analysis suggests that this association is especially strong in males (111209).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral riboflavin can prevent mortality due to CVD.\nEpidemiological research has found that dietary and supplemental riboflavin intake in the highest quartile, around 3.4 mg daily, is associated with a 47% lower risk of CVD mortality when compared with riboflavin intake in the lowest quartile, around 1 mg daily. The reduction in CVD mortality with riboflavin was enhanced by higher folate intake (110727). The validity of this finding is limited by the fact that dietary riboflavin intake was based on 2-day dietary recall.\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing riboflavin, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B1, B6, and B12 orally twice daily for 60 days modestly reduces symptom severity and pain, but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function, when compared with control (111702). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if any effects are due to riboflavin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial in patients with cataracts.\nObservational research has found that high dietary intake of riboflavin is associated with a reduced risk of nuclear cataracts and age-related lens opacification (6378, 14301). Furthermore, a clinical study in Chinese patients with nutrient deficiencies shows that taking a combination of riboflavin 3 mg plus niacin 40 mg daily also seems to reduce the risk of developing nuclear cataracts when compared with no supplementation (4885). It is unclear if the benefit is due to riboflavin, niacin, or the combination.\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral riboflavin helps to prevent cervical cancer.\nEpidemiological evidence has found that increased riboflavin intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with other B vitamins, is associated with a reduced risk of precancerous cervical lesions (11074).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial for adults with CKD.\nA large population study in adults with CKD found that lower dietary intake of riboflavin is associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality when compared with higher dietary intake (116650). This study did not assess the effects of riboflavin supplementation on mortality.\nless\nCognitive function. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in healthy adults aged 40-65 years shows that taking a combination supplement containing riboflavin 70 mg, other group B vitamins, ginkgo leaf, and bacopa daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of memory, attention, cognition, mood, or stress reactivity when compared with placebo (111334).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral riboflavin reduces colorectal cancer risk.\nEpidemiological evidence in a Chinese population suggests that increased dietary intake of riboflavin is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (105482).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial for depression.\nA large cross-sectional study in middle-aged adults suggests that dietary riboflavin intake above 2.1 mg daily is associated with an 8% lower prevalence of depression when compared with a riboflavin intake less than 1.6 mg daily. Subgroup analysis suggests that this association is especially strong in males (111209).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral riboflavin reduces the risk of developing gestational diabetes.\nA large prospective cohort study in pregnant adults shows that supplementation with riboflavin at doses over 2.5 mg daily during the first trimester and 2.1 mg daily in the second trimester is associated with a lower risk of developing gestational diabetes when compared with riboflavin doses under 1.1 mg daily. However, this effect was not found for dietary intake of riboflavin, only supplementation. Additionally, the participants were mostly Han Chinese adults, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations (111680).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Intravenous and oral riboflavin have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; riboflavin's effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that intravenous administration of a specific combination product containing succinic acid, inosine, nicotinamide, and riboflavin (Cytoflavin, Polysan) daily for 10 days followed by an oral formulation of the same product, taken daily for 76 days, reduces symptoms of diabetic neuropathy including paresthesia, numbness, and burning when compared with placebo (110503). It is unclear if these findings are due to riboflavin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral riboflavin reduces esophageal cancer risk.\nPopulation research in Iranian patients has found that low riboflavin status is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of esophageal cancer (71439). However, not all evidence agrees. Preliminary clinical studies in Chinese individuals with esophageal dysplasia shows that taking riboflavin, alone or in combination with calcium or niacin, for 3-5 years does not seem to reduce the risk of esophageal cancer in patients when compared with baseline or control (4679, 63576, 71488). Taking riboflavin 200 mg weekly, in combination with retinol 15 mg and zinc 50 mg, also does not seem to be beneficial in this patient population (71501). It is unclear if these findings are generalizable to geographic locations other than China and Iran.\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral riboflavin reduces colorectal cancer risk.\nLow quality clinical research in a Chinese population shows that taking riboflavin in combination with niacin does not reduce the risk of gastric cancer when compared with control (4679).\nless\nHypertension. There is limited evidence on the oral use of riboflavin for reducing blood pressure in patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype.\nA 677 C to T polymorphism on the MTHFR gene has been associated with hypertension. In patients with a confirmed MTHFR 677 TT genotype and premature cardiovascular disease, preliminary clinical research suggests that taking riboflavin 1.6 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 9 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 6 mmHg when compared with placebo. This decrease in blood pressure is larger than that reported in other trials, which may be due to the fact that only patients with the 677 TT genotype were included. These patients seem to respond to riboflavin therapy more so than patients with 677 CC or 677 CT genotype (92102). Additional clinical research in patients with the 677 TT genotype but without cardiovascular disease shows that taking riboflavin 1.6 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces SBP by 5.6 mmHg but does not reduce DBP (92103).\n\nThere is also interest in using dietary riboflavin for reducing the onset of hypertension. Some epidemiological evidence in a Chinese population has found that increased dietary intake of riboflavin is associated with a reduced risk of developing hypertension (105483).\nless\nLiver cancer. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with niacin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese individuals older than 55 years shows that taking riboflavin in combination with niacin does not seem to prevent liver cancer mortality when compared with control. However, there was a reduced risk of liver cancer mortality in people aged less than 55 years when compared with control (63470).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with niacin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese individuals shows that taking riboflavin in combination with niacin does not appear to reduce the risk of lung cancer when compared with control (34539).\nless\nMalaria. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children ages 5-14 years living in Gambia and at high risk for malaria exposure suggests that taking riboflavin, in combination with iron, thiamine, and vitamin C, for 3 months does not reduce the frequency or severity of malaria infections when compared with placebo (56730).\nless\nMalnutrition. There is limited evidence on the oral use of riboflavin with other ingredients in children at risk for kwashiorkor.\nA clinical study in Malawian children at risk for kwashiorkor, a severe form of malnutrition, suggests that taking riboflavin, vitamin E, selenium, and N-acetyl cysteine at a dose of three times the recommended dietary allowance does not prevent kwashiorkor, reduce edema, increase physical growth, or reduce infection when compared with placebo (71433).\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. Although there is interest in using oral riboflavin for mitochondrial myopathies, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of riboflavin for this condition.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral riboflavin slows the progression of MS-related disability.\nA small clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS who are undergoing treatment with disease-modifying therapies suggests that taking oral riboflavin 10 mg daily for six months is no more effective for improving disability than placebo (91752). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study sample size.\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if oral riboflavin prevents or slows progression of oral leukoplakia.\nPopulation research in people living in Uzbekistan suggests that low blood levels of riboflavin are associated with an increased prevalence of oral leukoplakia (71502). However, clinical evidence in patients with a high occurrence of oral and esophageal cancer who are living in Uzbekistan suggests that taking riboflavin 80 mg weekly for 20 months does not improve the prevalence or progression of oral leukoplakia when compared to baseline (71565). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group and unusual once weekly dosing. Furthermore, it is unclear if these results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Although there is interest in using oral riboflavin for pre-eclampsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of riboflavin for this purpose.\nPregnancy-related iron deficiency. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial in patients with iron deficiency due to pregnancy.\nPreliminary clinical research in pregnant patients in China suggests that adding riboflavin 1 mg daily to supplemental iron and folic acid does not improve iron status when compared with taking iron and folic acid alone (71480).\nless\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral riboflavin is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease.\nOne small clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease suggests that taking riboflavin 5 mg twice daily for 8 weeks increases serum iron and transferrin saturation when compared to baseline; however, riboflavin does not seem to improve serum ferritin or circulating hemoglobin levels (71566).\nless\nStroke. Oral riboflavin has only been evaluated in combination with niacin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in Chinese individuals with poor nutritional status who are at risk for stroke suggests that taking riboflavin 5.2 mg daily in combination with niacin 40 mg daily does not reduce the risk of stroke-related mortality (2673).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate riboflavin for these uses.",

However, this synthesis doesn't seem to significantly contribute to the body's supply of riboflavin, which is primarily obtained from dietary sources (6243, 9530). Riboflavin supplements aren't necessary during antibiotic therapy.\nless\nCHLORPROMAZINE (Thorazine)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nChlorpromazine might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nChlorpromazine has structural similarities to riboflavin and can interfere with its conversion to the active form, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (10518). In rats, chlorpromazine decreases FAD levels in the liver, kidneys, heart and skeletal muscle, increases urinary riboflavin excretion, and produces changes in erythrocyte enzyme activity consistent with riboflavin deficiency (10518, 10519, 10520, 10521). Chlorpromazine also inhibits renal tubular secretion and reabsorption of riboflavin (10515). Although these effects occur in rats at similar doses to those used in humans, data in humans are lacking. There isn't enough evidence to recommend use of riboflavin supplements with chlorpromazine or other phenothiazines.\nless\nDOXORUBICIN (Adriamycin, Rubex)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nDoxorubicin might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nPreliminary evidence indicates that doxorubicin interacts with riboflavin by forming complexes, competing for tissue binding sites, reducing conversion to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD, the active form of riboflavin), and increasing urinary excretion (9533, 10528, 10529, 10530). These effects may contribute to cardiac and muscle toxicity associated with doxorubicin, but data in humans are lacking.\nless\nORAL CONTRACEPTIVES\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nOral contraceptives might reduce riboflavin levels; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nOral contraceptives may interfere with the absorption of riboflavin, or its conversion to active coenzyme forms (9505, 10525). However, studies are conflicting. Some have found reduced levels of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD, the active form of riboflavin), reduced urinary riboflavin excretion, or reduced erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity consistent with riboflavin deficiency, in females taking oral contraceptives (4548, 10523, 10524, 10525). However, many of these studies involved females with marginal or deficient dietary riboflavin intake, who used high-dose oral contraceptives (50 mcg ethinyl estradiol/day). When dietary riboflavin intake is adequate, no interaction with oral contraceptives is found (9373, 10526, 10527, 10536). Routine riboflavin supplementation isn't necessary in females taking oral contraceptives.\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nPhenobarbital might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nSome evidence in animals suggests that phenobarbital induces metabolism of riboflavin in the liver. Levels of the active form of riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), are increased in the liver and levels of a hydroxylated metabolite are increased in the urine (10534, 10535). Also, some animal research suggests that phenobarbital does not significantly affect the content of flavin in the liver (23374).\nless\nPROBENECID (Benemid)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nProbenecid might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nIn humans, probenecid reduces renal tubular secretion and total urinary excretion of both supplemental and dietary riboflavin (10515, 10516, 10517). It may also reduce the active intestinal absorption mechanism for riboflavin (10516). After single doses of probenecid, the effect on renal excretion predominates, and plasma riboflavin levels are increased (10516, 10517). The effect of prolonged probenecid therapy on riboflavin balance, and therefore the clinical significance, is not known.\nless\nQUINACRINE\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nQuinacrine might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nQuinacrine has structural similarities to riboflavin and can interfere with its conversion to the active form flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (505, 10521). It's suggested that this could lead to riboflavin deficiency in humans, but it may also contribute to the therapeutic effects of quinacrine against malaria (10522). The clinical significance isn't known.\nless\nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTCAs might reduce active riboflavin levels; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nTCAs have structural similarities to riboflavin and can interfere with its conversion to the active form flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (10518). In animal models, very high doses of amitriptyline and imipramine (50 mg/kg daily) decrease FAD levels in the liver, heart, and brain. Lower doses (10 mg/kg daily) only affect levels in the heart (10519). Since these doses are higher than those used therapeutically in humans, it is unlikely that the effect is clinically significant or that supplements are necessary.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with riboflavin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing supplementation, riboflavin levels are increased in the blood (71404, 71411, 71460). In very-low-birthweight infants consuming preterm infant formulas augmented with riboflavin for one month, riboflavin concentrations in plasma increased from 45.3 ng/mL to 177.3 ng/mL (71576).\n\nIn one study in humans, the maximal amount of riboflavin absorbed from 60 mg of riboflavin was 27 mg. Additionally, the half-life of riboflavin absorption in this study was approximately 1.1 hours (71571).\n\nOral riboflavin supplementation results in the production of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin (7-hydroxymethylriboflavin) in blood plasma (71575, 71571). The apparent first-order absorption rate constant of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin was 1.2 per hour in healthy subjects, with peak concentrations of 40 nM/L in males and 20 nM/L in females within two hours. Peak concentrations and areas under the plasma curves were 5-16% of those of riboflavin. This was not found when riboflavin was given intravenously.\n\nIncreased gastrointestinal motility is associated with a decreased rate of absorption of riboflavin (4561).\nExcretion\nRiboflavin is excreted in the urine (71460, 71518, 71568). In very-low-birthweight infants consuming preterm infant formulas augmented with riboflavin for one month, riboflavin concentrations in urine increased from 534 ng/mL to 4,451 ng/mL (71576).\n\nIn a riboflavin saturation study in boys given a 2 mg oral load of riboflavin followed by 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg of riboflavin, the four-hour urinary excretion of riboflavin after the 2 mg load averaged 8.6%; this increased in groups receiving 1.0 and 1.5 mg daily (71518).\n\nPlasma riboflavin status may be dependent on the circadian variation, with a slightly lower excretion in the afternoon (71571).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRiboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin that is converted in the body to the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These cofactors attach to proteins known as flavoproteins. This activates flavoproteins which go on to play a role in many enzymatic and metabolic processes in the body (15). Riboflavin is needed for processes involved with activation of vitamin B6, creation of niacin, activity of the adrenal gland, formation of red blood cells, and maintenance of erythrocyte integrity.\nAnti-migraine effects\nSome researchers theorize that riboflavin in amounts exceeding its maximum absorptive capacity reaches the colon and may influence the gut microbiota by acting as a prebiotic. Gastrointestinal disorders have been associated with migraines, and riboflavin may modulate this relationship by restoring eubiosis (110725).\nAnticancer effects\nIn epidemiological research, plasma riboflavin was inversely associated with risk of advanced colorectal adenoma lesions (71478). Riboflavin was also found to be inversely related to oral and pharyngeal cancer risk (10821). However, in a separate study, dietary intakes of B vitamins, including riboflavin, were not associated with risk of breast, endometrium, ovary, colorectum, lung, or thyroid cancer (50303, 71583). Additionally, a large, long-term epidemiological study found that riboflavin intake was not associated with cancer mortality rates (110727). The role of riboflavin in reducing the risk of cancer is unclear.\n\nIn human research, a treatment plan containing riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, and niacin decreased the breast cancer tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen, decreased angiogenesis markers and cytokines, increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase levels, and resulted in a disappearance of RASSF1A DNA methylation patterns (44015, 71459, 71466, 71476). This may indicate a reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence and metastases. However, the influence of riboflavin alone is unclear.\n\nAdditionally, riboflavin is a cofactor for methionine synthase reductase (MTTR), an enzyme involved in DNA synthesis, methylation, and repair processes. Human research suggests that dietary riboflavin intake might be associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer in females for all MTTR C524T genetic polymorphisms, regardless of age or Helicobacter pylori status. This risk reduction appears to be greater in T+ carriers (TC, heterozygous patients; TT, homozygous mutant) when compared with the CC (wild-type) genotype. In patients with the TT and TC genotype, low riboflavin intake was associated with a 93% higher risk of gastric cancer when compared with the CC genotype (108067).\nBone effects\nEnhanced riboflavin intake increased bone mineral density in individuals with the TT genotype (homozygous mutant) of MTHFR (71428).\nCardiovascular effects\nRiboflavin-derived FAD is a cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Enhanced riboflavin status results in homocysteine lowering in individuals with the TT genotype (homozygous mutant) of MTHFR (50284, 71403, 71443). No homocysteine response is observed in CC or CT group patients (wild-type and heterozygous patients) with suboptimal riboflavin status. This genetic polymorphism is also implicated in elevated blood pressure. The TT genotype results in an MTHFR enzyme with decreased activity, secondary to the loss of the riboflavin cofactor, FAD. This effect is not seen in patients with the CC or CT genotypes. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is a product of an MTHFR catalyzed reaction. It regulates nitric oxide (NO). It also is needed for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. In patients with the TT allele, concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate are decreased. This leads to increased levels of plasma homocysteine. It is speculated that riboflavin supplementation decreases homocysteine levels, and may restore 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations and also prevent the breakdown of a cofactor of NO, increasing NO and lowering blood pressure. Although riboflavin appears to decrease elevated homocysteine levels in those with the TT genotype, this is not correlated with a decrease in blood pressure, this is not believed to be the mechanism of action being its blood pressure lowering effects (92102, 92103).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nThere is interest in using riboflavin for multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelination and inflammation of the CNS occur in patients with MS. Riboflavin is necessary for metabolism of essential fatty acids. Additionally, riboflavin is involved in the formation of myelin in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). In patients deficient in riboflavin, components of nerves including myelin lipids and cerebrosides, are reduced, and this may affect brain development. Homocysteine may play a role in MS. It appears that plasma levels of homocysteine are influenced by plasma levels of riboflavin. It is suspected that patients with MS have high levels of homocysteine, which can lead to neurotoxic events and cardiovascular dysfunction involved in MS. Riboflavin may reduce homocysteine levels, but in one study, riboflavin appeared to have no effect compared to placebo, indicating that its neurological effects may be independent of homocysteine (91752).\n\nThere is also interest in using riboflavin in patients suffering from migraine headaches. It has been suggested that reduced levels of nutrients, including riboflavin, may play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Nutrients, including riboflavin, are necessary for normal mitochondrial function. Riboflavin is a precursor for both FMN and FAD, which are involved in electron transport in the mitochondrial membrane. In migraine, mitochondrial dysfunction is present. Thus, it is speculated that riboflavin supplementation may decrease the pain associated with or possibly prevent migraine headaches (92101).\nErgogenic effects\nIn human research, restricted intake of riboflavin resulted in a significant decrease in aerobic power, onset of blood lactate accumulation, and oxygen consumption (71505, 71558). However, the role of riboflavin deficiency in these performance changes in not clear.\nMetabolic effects\nRiboflavin deficiency might contribute to lactic acidosis that can occur in HIV patients taking stavudine (d4T, Zerit), zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir) and similar nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs (2024).\nOcular effects\nFAD is a cofactor for glutathione reductase activity, and the increased glutathione levels produced by this enzyme may play a role in cataract prevention (71397). Glutathione reductase reduces oxidized glutathione to its reduced form, GSH. GSH is thought to protect the eye lens from oxidative damage. Patients with cataracts seem to have low levels of GSH. Some experts theorize that low levels of riboflavin are also associated with cataracts, however, research has been inconsistent. Some studies show a riboflavin deficiency and others do not (10913)."

Most studies show that oral ribose is not beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nClinical studies in trained cyclists show that taking ribose in various dosing regimens, including 10 grams daily for 5 days, 8 grams four times over 36 hours, or a single dose of 3 grams with folate 150 mcg, does not improve anaerobic cycling performance when compared with dextrose, cellulose, or maltodextrin (15724, 15727, 15728). In trained rowers, taking ribose 10 grams daily for 8 weeks was less beneficial than taking dextrose 10 grams daily for improving rowing performance in time trials (15725). One small study in healthy adults with various levels of fitness shows that taking D-ribose 10 grams daily for 5 days does not improve anaerobic cycling performance when compared with dextrose. However, in individuals with the lowest level of fitness, defined as a lower peak oxygen uptake at baseline, D-ribose might improve power output when compared with dextrose (100680). Research in untrained individuals has also failed to show benefit. Taking ribose 4 grams four times daily for 6 days or a single small dose of ribose (2D-Ribose ATP, GNC) 625 mg did not increase maximal intermittent exercise performance or power output when compared with placebo (15723, 15729).\n\nLimited research has evaluated ribose in combination with other ergogenic ingredients.

The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral ribose is beneficial in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nA small clinical study of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction shows that taking ribose powder 15 grams daily for 12 weeks increases Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores, vigor scores, and ejection fraction while decreasing biomarkers associated with disease severity and worsened prognosis, including B-type natriuretic peptides and lactate/adenosine triphosphate ratio, when compared with placebo.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn one pharmacokinetic study, the time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of D-ribose oral solution was around 17.5 minutes, 25 minutes, and 30 minutes after 2.5-gram, 5-gram, and 10-gram doses, respectively. The Tmax was not affected by administration with a high fat or high carbohydrate meal. The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) for each of these doses was 15.9 mcg/mL, 87.5 mcg/mL, and 195 mcg/mL, respectively, showing a 13-fold increase in Cmax with just a 4-fold increase in dose. D-ribose exposure, as measured by area-under the time-concentration curve (AUC), increased 22-fold from a 2.5-gram to a 10-gram dose. Administration of D-ribose 10 grams with a high fat or high carbohydrate meal was found to decrease its absorption, with a high carbohydrate meal decreasing absorption to a greater degree than a high fat meal. The decrease in absorption of D-ribose with a high fat meal may be due to the physical barrier created by the fat in the GI tract. With a high carbohydrate meal, it is possible there is competition for transport of D-ribose with other sugars present in the meal. The transport of D-ribose across the GI tract has been reported to be due to phosphorylation associated with active transport as well as passive diffusion of free D-ribose across the membrane into systemic circulation (92891).\nMetabolism\nThe metabolism of D-ribose involves phosphorylation to D-ribose-5-phosphate which undergoes further metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolytic pathway. More than 80% of an administered dose is metabolized. Glomerular filtration is the main process involved in renal metabolism, and D-ribose is not extracted by the liver to any significant degree (92891).\nExcretion\nUnder fasting conditions, the half-lives for D-ribose oral solution 2.5 grams, 5 grams, and 10 grams were 12, 15, and 20 minutes, respectively. The half-life for a 10-gram dose administered with a high fat or high carbohydrate meal was slightly longer at around 25 minutes. Clearance values after 2.5-gram, 5-gram, and 10-gram doses were 240 L/h, 115 L/h, and 83.2 L/h, respectively. The mean oral clearance of D-ribose 10 grams was nearly twice as high following a high carbohydrate meal (257 L/h) compared with a high fat meal (128 L/h). D-ribose was recovered from the urine during the 0-5 hour post-dose interval, with no D-ribose recovered in the subsequent 5-8 hour collection period. The amount of unchanged D-ribose in the urine was around 4-7%, resulting in a mean renal clearance between 5.3 L/h and 7.6 L/h (92891).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRibose is a naturally occurring pentose sugar (92891).\nCardiovascular effects\nD-ribose may accelerate ATP repletion in ischemic myocardium by promoting the production of phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate. It improves repletion of ATP stores by increasing precursors of ATP (71603). High energy bonds of ATP are the direct source for myocardial contractions (5652). During ischemia, the levels of ATP in the myocardium fall as the rate of oxidative phosphorylation decreases (5651, 5653) and do not recover if the period of no perfusion is too long (5651). ADP and AMP levels rise transiently during ischemia but decrease as they are dephosphorylated into metabolites (adenine, inosine and hypoxanthine) which easily diffuse through the cell membrane and are washed out of the myocardium during reperfusion (5652, 5653). Since the metabolites which use the salvage synthetic pathway are no longer available as precursors for ATP resynthesis, the de-novo synthetic pathway is activated (5652). Restoration of ATP levels via this pathway is slow in comparison to the salvage pathway (5652, 5664) due to the short supply of PRPP which is usually supplied by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (5664). Animal studies suggest that exogenous ribose with adenine improves myocardial ATP, ADP, and adenine nucleotide recovery after moderate periods of ischemia and improves recovery of contractile myocardial function (5652, 5653). Other animal studies suggest exogenous ribose given during both periods of ischemia and reperfusion significantly increases ATP levels (5659) and may shorten ATP recovery time (5654, 5659, 5660). Laboratory evidence also suggests ribose may have a role in preserving hearts for transplantation by maintaining ATP levels (5666). Clinical research in patients with CHD and an ejection fraction below 50% undergoing a dobutamine stress test shows that intravenous administration of D-ribose 10% at 180 mg/kg/hr for 4.5 hours improves the contractile response of segments with resting dysfunction when compared with placebo. However, D-ribose does not reduce stress-induced ischemia during high-dose dobutamine when compared with placebo (71603).\nDiagnostic imaging\nPost-ischemic intravenous infusion of ribose has been shown to facilitate thallium-201 (201Tl) redistribution, thereby improving identification of ischemic myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (5662, 71606, 5663), possibly due to its metabolic function. However, one study showed that a five-minute bolus injection of D-ribose following a combined adenosine/dynamic exercise stress conferred little benefit on the identification of redistribution of thallium-201 (71607).\nExercise performance-enhancing effects\nIt is thought that after exercise, muscle ATP is significantly lower, and that the availability of ribose in muscle is the limiting step in resynthesis of ATP. And thus, administration of ribose may help to increase the supply of ATP (15729).\nMetabolic effects\nRibose, usually supplied by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt), is rapidly taken up by cells and phosphorylated to ribose-5-phosphate (5653). Ribose is rate-limiting in the production of phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate (PRPP) (5652, 5653, 5682), a precursor for the salvage and de-novo adenine nucleotide synthetic pathways which maintain adenine, ADP, and AMP levels for the resynthesis of ATP (5651, 5652, 5665, 5682). Ribose can be synthesized by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of glucose metabolism. However, this pathway is slow in certain tissues (including cardiac), due to a low level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme in the PPP (92891). Administration of exogenous D-ribose can bypass the rate limiting PPP, which results in significant acceleration in purine nucleotide synthesis (92891). Additionally, the PPP produces NADPH for reducing reactions. NADPH could act as a cofactor for the reduction of glutathione disulfide to GSH, leading to the recycling of GSH. MDA and GSH are markers of increased oxygen free radicals. Ribose enhances the generation of adenine nucleotides. Exogenous ribose bypasses G6PD and 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase in the PPP, which enhances the recovery of ATP following ischemia. G6PD is a regulatory enzyme in the PPP. Exercise, ischemia, hypoxia, and MDA reduce G6PD activity. As G6PD activity decreases, NADPH production is suppressed with decreases concentrations of GSH. As such, ribose may affect the production of NADPH synthesis which could affect G6PD activity and the cell's redox status. D-ribose may accelerate ATP repletion after high intensity exercise in skeletal muscle during (5656, 5657, 5658).\n\nThere is interest in using ribose in patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (MAD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscle's ability to process ATP during strenuous activity. Anecdotal reports suggest that taking ribose 3 grams every 10 minutes, beginning one hour before exercise and continuing until the end of the exercise session, or 4 grams as a single dose prior to exercise, might help to prevent muscle stiffness and cramps (5677, 5679)."

Taking full-fat rice bran, reduced-fat rice bran, or rice bran oil daily appears to modestly reduce lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The effects of rice bran on other types of cholesterol are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients with and without hypercholesterolemia shows that consuming rice bran or its extracts reduces total cholesterol by 12 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 15 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 15 mg/dL, but does not impact high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with placebo (116262). Conversely, a meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies, some included in the analysis above, in patients with hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, or who have survived colorectal cancer shows that taking rice bran 20 to 100 grams/day does not improve total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, or triglycerides when compared with control (112092). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of patients, dosages, and study designs included in the analyses.\n\nThe oil from rice bran has also been shown to affect the lipid profile (1354, 97524, 100481, 106591). Multiple meta-analyses of small clinical studies show that taking rice bran oil for 2.5-13 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 7-8 mg/dL when compared with control. However, rice bran oil does not appear to affect HDL cholesterol levels. Rice bran oil may also modestly lower triglyceride levels; however, results are conflicting between meta-analyses (97524, 106591). The validity of these findings is limited by inclusion of low-quality studies and the inclusion of patients without hypercholesterolemia at baseline. The effectiveness of rice bran oil may also depend on the content of gamma-oryzanol. A small clinical study in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking rice brain oil 30 mL containing 4000, 8000, and 11000 ppm gamma-oryzanol daily for 4 weeks decreases LDL-C levels when compared with control. The greatest effects occurred in the patients receiving higher gamma-oryzanol content (8000 and 11000 ppm) (100481).\n\nAdditionally, subgroup data from a meta-analysis suggest that rice bran oil has greater lipid-lowering effects on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than whole rice bran; further, the effects of rice bran seem greater at doses of 30 grams daily and above, and for durations over 4 weeks (11626)\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nColorectal cancer.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRice bran is obtained from the outer hull of the rice Oryza sativa. It contains 21% fiber, 21% lipids, 13% amino acids, and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals (884, 885). It also contains inositol and IP-6 (7598).\n\nMost of the fiber in rice bran is insoluble, although this may vary based on the source of rice bran (865, 106058). Some research also shows that refined rice bran may have more soluble fiber than raw rice bran (106058). Rice bran contains a relatively high percentage of oil compared with most other brans (865). The oil contains beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols (7520). It also contains alpha-linolenic acid, which might increase the concentration of fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (7520, 7521). Other constituents of rice bran oil are gamma-oryzanol and tocotrienols (7521, 7598). Rice bran also contains lipase, which causes a rapid deterioration of rice bran oil unless the lipase is promptly stabilized by heat or other treatments (865).\nAnticancer effects\nRice bran can increase stool size by several mechanisms, including water retention (871, 879). Scientists think increased fecal bulk reduces risk of cancer because it dilutes carcinogens, especially tumor promoters such as secondary bile acids (871).\n\nIn addition, some researchers believe rice bran may reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by improving intestinal microbiota biodiversity. Preliminary clinical research in patients at high risk of CRC shows that taking rice bran 30 grams daily for 24 weeks increases gastrointestinal lactobacillus and firmicutes bacteria levels when compared with placebo. In theory, this may reduce the risk of CRC (106588). However, clinical research in adults with colorectal adenomas shows that increasing dietary fiber, including rice bran, for up to 4 years does not reduce the risk of recurrent adenomas (4820). Also, observational research in females has found that increasing dietary fiber consumption, including rice bran, for up to 16 years is not associated with colorectal cancer risk (4821).\nAntidiabetic effects\nDiets high in fiber have resulted in lower insulin levels, less weight gain, and a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension (2737).\nAntihistamine effects\nA rice bran isolate designated as Compound X shows evidence of antihistamine activity (884).\nAntimicrobial effects\nRice bran inhibits bacterial growth (884).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, rice bran acts as an antioxidant and scavenges free radicals. A clinical trial in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming rice bran oil increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces malondialdehyde levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared with a standard diet alone (116260). Some research also shows that refined rice bran may possess more antioxidant activity than raw rice bran (106058).\nCardiovascular effects\nAlthough whole rice bran seems to have some positive effects on cholesterol levels, rice bran oil is likely responsible for the most significant effect. However, defatted rice bran oil does not appear to affect cholesterol (865, 7520, 7521). The oil contains beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols that have been used to reduce cholesterol absorption (7520). Furthermore, other constituents of rice bran oil, including gamma-oryzanol and tocotrienols, might lower cholesterol levels by altering cholesterol absorption and excretion (7521, 7598). Preliminary evidence in adult males with coronary artery disease suggests that rice bran oil may improve markers of atherogenicity and insulin resistance when compared with sunflower oil (110034).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using rice bran to reduce diarrhea and malnutrition in infants. Preliminary evidence in infants from low- and middle-income countries suggests that consuming rice bran 1-5 grams daily for 6 months might decrease levels of fecal secretory IgA and improve other markers of intestinal inflammation (110035).\nGenitourinary effects\nRice bran has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent urinary stone disease, perhaps because the phytin in rice bran reduces calcium absorption (881). Preliminary observational research in patient with idiopathic hypercalciuria and healthy females on a calcium-rich diet shows that taking rice bran daily for up to 3 years reduces renal excretion of calcium and increases renal excretion of oxalic acid when compared with baseline (874, 880, 881, 882).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using rice bran for reducing obesity and complications of obesity. Gamma-oryzanol, a constituent of rice bran, is theorized to improve energy metabolism and therefore reduce weight gain. Animal research shows that consuming rice bran extract while following a high-fat diet results in reduced weight gain and reduced increase in fat tissue when compared with following a high fat diet alone (103758).\n\nThere is also interest in using rice bran for metabolic syndrome. Low-quality research shows that taking oral refined rice bran 20 grams twice daily for 8 weeks reduces waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and triglycerides when compared with sunflower oil. However, the validity of this study is limited by unclear patient inclusion criteria (106058).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nAnimal research shows that supplementing the diet with fermented rice bran for 1 month attenuates myocyte muscle atrophy in diabetic rats when compared with a standard diet. However, the myocyte area did not return to normal levels. Fermented rice bran supplementation also reduced muscle expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is believed to contribute to muscle atrophy (106587)."

It is described as a biological response modifier (99101). It is thought to sensitize cancer cells, increasing apoptosis (98692, 99101). Results from small studies of healthy individuals and individuals with cancer suggest that rice bran arabinoxylan compound enhances natural killer cell and dendritic cell activity and increases the production of cytokines from activated T cells. However, it does not seem to increase natural killer cell count (3118, 3119, 3120, 98690, 99101). In vitro and in animal models, rice bran arabinoxylan compound has been shown to activate dendritic cells to prime tumor cell killing by T cells and to stimulate the activity of other immune cells such as macrophages. Rice bran arabinoxylan compound also has synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents in animal models (3116, 3117, 98688, 98689, 98691, 98694, 98695, 99101).\nImmune effect\nSome laboratory studies suggest that rice bran arabinoxylan compound might improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, activating dendritic cells, increasing interferon-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increasing the production of other cytokines, and acting synergistically with interleukin-2 (aldesleukin) to increase natural killer cell activity and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (3116, 3117, 98688, 98689, 98691, 98694, 98695).

Levels of some amino acids, such as lysine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, and threonine are present in slightly lower quantities when compared with casein protein (97796). Proteins in rice include the glutelins (80%), globulins (4-15%), albumins (1-5%), and prolamins (2-8%) (97805). Because rice protein is not a purified protein source, phytochemicals and fat-related plant compounds are also found in rice protein (97810).\nAnti-cancer effects\nRice protein and its prolamins have anti-cancer effects in vitro and in animal models. These effects might be due to changes in cytokine levels and/or alterations in cellular signalling, resulting in apoptosis (97803, 97810).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn an animal diabetic model, rice protein had no effect on glucose tolerance or fasting blood glucose levels (97796). However, rice protein maintained glomerular permeability to protein and protected against diabetic nephropathy (97796). Also, a single dose of rice protein hydrolysate from the endosperm or bran reduces postprandial glycemia, possibly by stimulating the excretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (97805).\nCardioprotective effects\nIn an apoE deficient mouse model of atherosclerosis, rice protein isolate led to a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions, which was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and decreased production of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (97809).\nHypotensive effects\nIn an animal hypertensive model, hydrolyzed rice protein reduced systolic blood pressure. This was possibly due to inhibition of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE), which has been demonstrated in vitro.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Roman chamomile is the flowerhead. Roman chamomile contains 0.4% to 1.75% volatile oil, sesquiterpene lactones (nobilin, 3-epinobilin, 1,10-epoxynobilin, 3-dehydronobulin), flavonoids and their glycosides (apigenin, apigetrin, apin, quercitrin, quercetin, luteolin), organic acids (oxalic, quinic, malic, citric, and fumaric acids), scopoletin-7-glucoside, choline, inositol, anthemic acid, phenolic acids, and fatty acids (4, 11, 94070, 97293). The volatile oil contains angelic and tiglic acid esters, cineole, pinocarveol, pinocarvone, chamazulene, farnesol, nerolidol, and sesquiterpene lactones (4).\nAnti-allergy effects\nSome evidence suggests azulene constituents contained in Roman chamomile volatile oil exert anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting histamine release. However, the constituent nobilin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is thought to trigger allergy in sensitive individuals (4).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nAnimal research shows that Roman chamomile reduces plasma glucose levels in both healthy rats and those with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Inhibition of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis may play a role in the anti-diabetes effects, which appear to be independent of insulin secretion. Other possible actions include increasing insulin sensitivity, stimulating the use of peripheral glucose, or slowing digestion to reduce the rate of carbohydrate absorption (94069).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that Roman chamomile inhibits lipid peroxidation and increases free radical scavenging. A decoction of Roman chamomile has reduced anti-inflammatory activity when compared with a liquid infusion or methanolic extract, possibly due to its reduced phenolic acid and organic acid content (97293).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro research shows that an ethyl acetate extract of Roman chamomile exhibits cytotoxicity against cell lines for human breast adenocarcinoma, human erythroleukemia, and human malignant melanoma. Cytotoxicity increases with increasing concentration and time for all cell lines. The anticancer effects may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids as well as polyphenols including apigenin (94070). The sesquiterpinoids nobilin, 1,10-epoxynobilin, and 3-dehydronobilin also show antitumor activity (4). In other in vitro research, a methanolic extract and a liquid infusion of Roman chamomile inhibit the growth of breast adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but do not alter the growth of non-small cell lung cancer, colon carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma cells. A decoction preparation does not exert activity on any cancer cell lines, possibly due to its reduced phenolic acid and organic acid content (97293).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome animal research shows that administration of an aqueous extract of Roman chamomile, 140 mg/kg daily for three weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure, increases urinary output, and increases electrolyte excretion (94071). In vitro research shows that an aqueous extract of Roman chamomile has vasorelaxant effects (94072)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRooibos is prepared from the leaves and stems of Aspalathus linearis. Laboratory research of rooibos plant extracts has revealed 187 compounds, including polysaccharides (4120, 4121), flavonoids, including dihydrochalcones (4122, 104211), a low amount of tannins (less than 5%) (5, 6), polyphenols (104211), and a relatively high amount of vitamin C (9.4%) (6). Specific constituents in rooibos include aspalathin, isoorientin, orientin, rutin, isovitexin, vitexin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercetin, luteolin, chrysoeryol, nothofagin, and hyperoside (71614, 104211). Early research shows that the type of rooibos (green or red), as well as the method of preparation, such as microwave, cold brew, or traditional brew, affects its composition (104212).\nAnti-mutagenic effects\nIn vitro research shows that unfermented rooibos tea has antimutagenic effects (71610).\nAnti-viral effects\nSome in vitro evidence suggests that daily intake of acid polysaccharides found in the extracts of rooibos might suppress HIV infection (4120, 4121).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere is interest in rooibos' antioxidant effects for reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. In vitro and animal research shows that rooibos has antioxidant effects (4122, 71610, 71619). In vitro, green rooibos demonstrates almost two-fold higher antioxidant activity than red rooibos. Additionally, microwave preparation, in which the water is boiled for 5 minutes, results in twice the total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity level, regardless of red or green variety, when compared with regular and cold-brew preparation. Aspalathin is a major compound in rooibos and is thought to contribute to its antioxidant effects (104212). Clinical research in healthy adults at risk for cardiovascular disease shows that drinking 6 cups of fermented rooibos tea daily for 6 weeks decreases lipid peroxidation but does not affect blood antioxidant capacity (101252).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in the cardio-protective effects of rooibos tea, such as its lipid lowering and blood pressure lowering effects. Clinical research in healthy adults at risk for cardiovascular disease shows that drinking 6 cups of fermented rooibos tea daily for 6 weeks reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and increases levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (101252). Rooibos tea might also have blood pressure lowering effects by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that a single dose of 400 mL of rooibos inhibits ACE activity 30 and 60 minutes after tea consumption. More specifically, drinking rooibos tea inhibits ACE genotypes II and ID, but not genotype DD (101253).\nHepatic effects\nThere is conflicting research about the effects of rooibos on the liver. In a rat model of liver injury, rooibos tea reduced liver enzyme levels and also resulted in regression of steatosis and cirrhosis (71613). Other animal research in rats also shows that taking rooibos extract 10-300 mg/kg orally once does not cause apparent hepatotoxicity (112193).\n\nHowever, excessive long-term consumption of rooibos has been associated with liver damage. In a case-report, a 37-year-old man drinking 10 cups of rooibos tea daily for over a year presented with hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia which could have resulted due to the hepatic dysfunction (101254). Other research also shows that rooibos may have hepatotoxic effects. In vitro research shows that rooibos extract reduces hepatic cell viability when compared with control (112193).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that rooibos tea extract increases interleukin 2 production (71612).\nNeurological effects\nAnimal research shows that rooibos might prevent age-related changes to the central nervous system (4123).\nRenal effects\nAnimal research in mice with experimentally induced renal damage, shows that the constituents of green rooibos aspalathin and nothofagin reduce plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and total urine protein. This suggests a renal protective effect (101255).\nWeight effects\nAnimal research in obese rates shows that taking rooibos leaf extract 60 mg/kg orally daily for 6-7 weeks improves glucose tolerance, but not body weight, when compared with control (112192)."

Most clinical research shows that taking a specific Rosa canina rose hip powder product (LitoZin/i-flex, Hyben Vital), 2.5 grams orally twice daily for 3-4 months, reduces pain and stiffness, improves function and mobility, and decreases use of rescue medication when compared with placebo (71646, 71658, 71660, 71661). Clinical research in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific combination product containing Rosa canina rose hip fruit puree 24 grams, stinging nettle leaf 160 mg, devil's claw 108 mg, and vitamin D 200 IU (Rosaxan, Medagil Gesundheitsgesellschaft) daily for 12 weeks reduces pain by 66% and improves quality of life, but does not reduce analgesic use, when compared with a control group (97937). However, one crossover study shows mixed results. Rose hip was shown to be effective for osteoarthritis only when administered after, but not before, placebo treatment (71641). This inconsistency might be due to a carryover effect of rose hip or delayed activity of the supplement.\nless\nPostoperative pain. When taken immediately prior to surgery, oral rose hip seems to reduce pain following a Cesarean section.\nClinical research shows that taking a single dose of Rosa damascena rose hip extract 1600 mg, 15 minutes prior to anesthesia for a Cesarean section, delays the need for postoperative analgesics and reduces their use over the next 24 hours when compared with placebo. Almost all patients taking placebo requested analgesics within 2 hours of surgery, compared with only 11% of those taking rose hip extract. In addition, this rose hip extract moderately reduced the level of pain over the 24-hour period (104556).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral rose hip is beneficial for improving wrinkles.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Rosa canina rose hip powder (Hyben Vital) 1.5 grams twice daily for 8 weeks improves wrinkles, skin moisture, and elasticity when compared with baseline. However, it is unclear if these benefits are clinically significant (104557). Also, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Although there has been interest in using oral rose hip for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rose hip for this condition.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral rose hip is beneficial for obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Rosa canina rose hip powder 40 grams daily mixed with apple juice for 6 weeks does not significantly affect weight or glucose tolerance when compared with placebo. However, it decreases total cholesterol by 5%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 6%, and systolic blood pressure by 4% when compared with placebo (18104).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral rose hip is beneficial for RA.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking a specific Rosa canina rose hip powder product (LitoZin/i-flex, Hyben Vital) 2.5 grams (5 capsules) twice daily over 6 months improves patient scores on a disability index, as well as other subjective physician- and patient-based assessments, when compared with placebo (17416).\nless\nSciatica. Although there has been interest in using oral rose hip for sciatica, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rose hip for this condition.\nSexual dysfunction. Oral rose hip has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in women with sexual dysfunction shows that taking a specific combination tablet (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research) containing a standardized extract of rose hip (Rosvita) 50 mg, maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 20 mg, L-arginine 200 mg, and L-citrulline 200 mg orally daily for 8 weeks, in combination with a management program consisting of lifestyle, diet, exercise, and stress control changes, improves overall sexual function when compared with the management program alone (91963). Taking the same product in a dose of 2 tablets twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to the lifestyle management program, improves vaginal dryness in pre- and post-menopausal women when compared with lifestyle management alone (103611). The effect of rose hip extract alone on sexual dysfunction is unclear.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral rose hip is beneficial for UTI prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in women who have undergone a Cesarean section shows that taking Rosa canina rose hip powder 500 mg twice daily, starting 2 days post-partum and continuing for 20 days, reduces the odds of asymptomatic, culture-positive UTIs by 68% when compared with placebo. However, rose hip does not appear to reduce the incidence of symptomatic UTIs in these patients (97938).\nless\nVitamin C deficiency. Although there has been interest in using oral rose hip for vitamin C deficiency, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rose hip for this condition.\nStretch marks (striae gravidarum). Topical rose hip has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific formulation containing hydroxyprolisilane C, rose hip oil, gotu kola triterpenes, and vitamin E (Velastisa Antiestrías, ISDIN) twice daily during pregnancy, beginning at week 10-14 and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the severity of both new and old stretch marks when compared with placebo. It also appears to decrease the incidence of stretch marks by about 84% in women without previous striae (92507).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate rose hip for these uses.",

The use of antioxidants like vitamin C during chemotherapy is controversial. There is concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, and thiotepa (391). In contrast, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). Further, some animal research suggests that the antioxidant effects of rose hip might attenuate cyclophosphamide-induced testicular toxicity (111413). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants found in rose hip, such as vitamin C, have on the effectiveness and adverse effects of chemotherapy.\nless\nALUMINUM\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, rose hip might increase the amount of aluminum absorbed from aluminum compounds.\nRose hip contains vitamin C.

This has not been shown in humans. Theoretically, concomitant use of rose hip might reduce the effectiveness of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs.\nless\nANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, the antioxidant effects of rose hip might reduce the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics.\nRose hip contains the antioxidant vitamin C.

It has been suggested that acidification of the urine by vitamin C can decrease the urinary excretion of salicylates, increasing plasma salicylate levels (3046). However, short-term use of up to 6 grams daily of vitamin C does not seem to affect urinary pH or salicylate excretion (10588, 10589). The vitamin C content of rose hip is typically about 500 mg per 100 grams. Thus, a clinically significant interaction between rose hip and aspirin is unlikely.\nless\nESTROGENS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, rose hip might increase blood levels of estrogens.\nRose hip contains vitamin C. Increases in plasma estrogen levels of up to 55% have occured under some circumstances when vitamin C is taken concurrently with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, including topical products (129, 130, 11161). It is suggested that vitamin C prevents oxidation of estrogen in the tissues, regenerates oxidized estrogen, and reduces sulfate conjugation of estrogen in the gut wall (129, 11161). When tissue levels of vitamin C are high, these processes are already maximized and supplemental vitamin C does not have any effect on estrogen levels. However, increases in plasma estrogen levels may occur when women who are deficient in vitamin C take supplements (11161).\nless\nLITHIUM\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, rose hip might increase blood levels of lithium.\nRose hip is thought to have diuretic properties (5, 18). Theoretically, due to these potential diuretic effects, rose hip might reduce excretion and increase levels of lithium. The dose of lithium might need to be decreased.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, rose hip might reduce the effectiveness of warfarin; however, its vitamin C content is likely too low to produce clinically significant effects.\nRose hip contains vitamin C. High doses of vitamin C may reduce the response to warfarin, possibly by causing diarrhea and reducing warfarin absorption (11566). This occurred in two people who took up to 16 grams daily of vitamin C, and resulted in decreased prothrombin time (9804, 9806). Lower doses of 5-10 grams daily of vitamin C can also reduce warfarin absorption, but this does not seem to be clinically significant (9805, 9806, 11566, 11567). The vitamin C content of rose hip is typically about 500 mg per 100 grams. Thus, a clinically significant interaction between rose hip and warfarin is unlikely.\nless",

Vitamin C is metabolized to oxalic acid, so increased consumption of vitamin C increases the urinary concentration of oxalic acid (10356). In people with a history of oxalate kidney stones (the most common type of nephrolithiasis), supplemental vitamin C 1 gram per day appears to increase stone risk by 40% (12653). In men, daily supplemental vitamin C doses as low as 250 mg have been associated with a higher risk of kidney stones (104029). Tell patients prone to kidney stone formation to avoid high doses of rose hip. The vitamin C content of rose hip is typically about 500 mg per 100 grams.\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of rose hip.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nFresh rose hip contains vitamin C. The amounts of vitamin C depends on species, origin, and geographic location, with concentration differences of over 6-fold in the same species from different locations (104554). Some species harvested at altitudes around 630 meters above sea level contain between 275-780 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams of rose hip pulp, while other species harvested at over 800 meters above sea level contain between 450-1160 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams of rose hip pulp (91689). Vitamin C levels are highest in the fresh fruit and lowest in dried fruit (104554).\n\nRose hip also contains flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenols as well as major and minor carotenoids, all of which contribute to its antioxidant capacity (71644, 71628, 104554). Phenolic compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol derivatives, catechins, and ellagic acid have been identified. Levels depend on the ripeness of the fruit (104554). The major carotenoids identified include beta-carotene, lycopene, rubixanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin (71628, 104554). Tocopherols have also been identified. Levels depend on species and harvesting time (104554). Several other vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B1, vitamin E, calcium, and zinc, have been identified in rose hip (71634, 71644, 71628, 104554). Rose hip seed oil contains linoleic, alpha-linolenic acid, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids, as well as galactolipids (104554).\nAnti-aging effects\nRose hip extract has shown anti-aging effects on the skin in human research (104557). The anti-aging effects of rose hip are likely related to the antioxidant properties of phenolics and vitamin C (104554).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, rose hip decreases C-reactive protein levels in patients with osteoarthritis (71633). In addition, some research suggests that a specific formulation of Rosa canina rose hip powder (LitoZin/i-flex, Hyben Vital) can reduce the rate of migration of polymorphonucleated leukocytes in vitro and reduce serum C-reactive protein levels in humans (71641, 71646). These anti-inflammatory effects are not considered to be related to the vitamin C content of the formulation, but possibly to a galactolipid (71640, 71641, 71646, 104554). Other in vitro research shows that rose hip inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (104554).\nAnti-obesity effects\nRose hip is of interest for weight loss in patients with obesity; however, this has not been shown in human research (18104). In an animal model, rose hip extract reduced abdominal visceral fat. The constituent of interest is a kaempferol derivative (104554).\nAnti-ulcerogenic effects\nRose hip is of interest for protecting against gastric ulcers. In animal models, rose hip prevents ulcer formation, possibly by preventing gastric mucosa erosion (104554).\nAnticancer effects\nDue to the high levels of antioxidants in rose hip, it is of interest in the treatment of cancer. In vitro, rose hip extract reduces the viability of various cancer cell lines. Various mechanisms involving intracellular signaling have been proposed. In addition, although the polyphenols are thought to be the main constituents of interest, other constituents of interest include the carotenoids and polysaccharides (104554).\nAntimicrobial effects\nRose hip is of interest for various types of infections. Rose hip has shown antibacterial effects against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria strains in vitro (104554).\nAntioxidant effects\nVarious in vitro, animal, and clinical studies suggest that rose hip increases antioxidant capacity, glutathione redox, and levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione; inhibits lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species; and improves DPPH radical scavenging species (59999, 71633, 71634, 71644, 71651, 71654, 104554, 111413). Vitamin C, along with various flavonoids, non-flavonoid polyphenols, and major and minor carotenoids are thought to be responsible for the antioxidant effects of rose hip. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, decreasing oxidants in gastric juice, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative DNA and protein damage (3042, 104554). Among the polyphenols, the largest contribution to total antioxidant capacity (TAA) comes from the non-flavonoid components pyrogallol, gallic acid, and m- and p-coumaric acid. The flavonoids quercetin, catechin, and epicatechin also make a significant contribution to the TAA (71644).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research in rabbit and human platelets shows that rugosin E, a constituent isolated from rose hip, is a potent platelet aggregating agent compared to other ellagitannins tested. The researchers proposed that rugosin E may be an ADP receptor agonist in rabbit platelets (71653).\nDermatologic effects\nA formulation containing rose hip oil and other ingredients has been used topically to treat and prevent stretch marks. It is theorized that rose hip oil helps prevent stretch marks by increasing the production of collagen and elastin fibers (92507). This effect may be attributed to the vitamin C content of rose hip. Vitamin C is required for collagen formation, as well as tissue repair (15, 3042).\nRenal effects\nRose hip is traditionally used for renal disorders. In animal research, rose hip has been shown to reduce renal damage and decrease calcium oxalate content. The mechanism of action is possibly related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds (104554)."

It is unclear if rosemary aromatherapy improves memory.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking rosemary 500 mg orally twice daily for one month improves memory by approximately 14% when compared with placebo (98536). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying four drops of pure rosemary essential oil (Tisserand Aromatherapy) to an aromatherapy diffuser pad 5 minutes before a single test period can improve the quality, but not the speed, of memory recall, and increase alertness and contentment more than lavender aromatherapy or no aroma (18323).\n\nRosemary aromatherapy has also been evaluated for improving memory in adults with kidney failure. A small clinical study in patients (mean age 53 years) undergoing hemodialysis shows that aromatherapy with rosemary essential oil three times weekly for 1 month does not improve medication adherence or measures of prospective and retrospective memory when compared with a control group. In this study, five drops of rosemary essential oil were applied to gauze, which was then placed 10 cm from the patient's nose for 30 minutes starting 1 hour after hemodialysis (109559).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbortion. Although there has been interest in the use of oral rosemary as an abortifacient, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rosemary for this purpose.\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral rosemary is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nA small clinical study in healthy individuals aged 65-90 years shows that a single 750 mg dose of powdered rosemary leaf in tomato juice may improve memory speed. However, higher single doses of 1500-6000 mg seem to have a deleterious effect on memory speed. For other measures of attention and memory, there were no clear benefits across the range of doses from 750-6000 mg (18246).\n\nOral rosemary has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults aged 62 years or younger shows that taking a combination product containing equal parts rosemary, lemon balm, and sage twice daily for 2 weeks modestly improves word recall when compared with placebo. However, it does not appear to have benefit in adults aged 63 years and older (97277). It is unclear if any benefit is due to rosemary, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAlopecia areata.

It is unclear if oral rosemary is beneficial for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, preliminary clinical research shows that taking rosemary tea daily for 90 days decreases glycated hemoglobin levels by 15% and waist and hip circumference by 6% and improves insulin resistance. However, there was no effect on fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, body weight, or body mass index (BMI). The tea was made by adding rosemary 2 grams to a liter of boiling water for 3 minutes and then passing through a sieve (105323). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking rosemary powder 3 grams daily for 4 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose levels or improve lipid profile when compared with baseline. These endpoints were improved in a group of healthy adults (105327). The validity of the findings from these studies is limited by the lack a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Canephron N, Bionorica) containing 18 mg each of rosemary leaf, centaury herb, and lovage root per tablet, as two tablets three times daily for 6 months along with standard antidiabetes treatment and enalapril (Vasotec), decreases microalbuminuria by 73%, decreases albumin:creatinine ratio by 46%, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 25%, and lowers triglyceride levels by 43%, but does not improve glomerular filtration rate, when compared to baseline. Improvements were greater in those taking the combination product than in those treated only with standard antidiabetes therapy and enalapril. However, the combination product does not appear to improve reductions in total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (91726).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral rosemary is beneficial for dysmenorrhea.\nIn patients with moderate primary dysmenorrhea, clinical research shows that taking rosemary extract 220 mg every 8 hours for the first three days of the menstrual cycle, repeated for two menstrual cycles, is as effective as mefenamic acid for reducing average pain and bleeding when compared with two baseline cycles (105328).\nless\nFatigue. Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy young adults with below-average energy levels shows that taking a single dose of a mixture of rosemary from Albania (Rosmarinus officinalis) and Morocco (Rosmarinus eriocalyx) 1.7 grams does not consistently improve sustained attention, motivation to perform cognitive tasks, mental energy, or mental fatigue when compared with placebo (91731).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with fibromyalgia shows that taking an oral product containing rosemary leaf extract, oleanolic acid from olive leaf, and rho iso-alpha acids from hops (Meta050, Metagenics), at a dose of 440 mg three times daily for 4 weeks, then 880 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, does not improve symptoms when compared to baseline (18327).\nless\nGingivitis. A mouth rinse containing rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate gingivitis and mild plaque shows that rinsing the mouth with 10 mL of mouthwash containing 5% v/v of a combined alcoholic extract of rosemary, calendula, and ginger for 30 seconds twice daily after meals for 2 weeks decreases plaque formation, gingival inflammation, and gingival bleeding similarly to chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% mouthwash and better than a placebo mouthwash (93555).\nless\nHypertension. Although there is interest in using oral rosemary for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of rosemary for this condition.\nHypotension. It is unclear if oral rosemary is beneficial for hypotension.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with primary hypotension shows that taking rosemary essential oil (Metapharmaceutical) 1 mL every 8 hours for 44 weeks increases systolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 7 mmHg when compared to baseline. However, blood pressure returned to near baseline values after treatment discontinuation (91730).\nless\nMental alertness. It is unclear if rosemary aromatherapy is beneficial for improving mental alertness.\nPreliminary clinical research in nurses working on a night shift shows that placing one drop of rosemary oil on a surgical mask that is worn for 2 hours with a 10-minute on/15-minute off cycle modestly increases alertness and reduces sleepiness when compared with a water drop control (105324).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral rosemary leaf is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking rosemary leaf powder 2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks, in conjunction with diet and exercise recommendations, does not improve measures of liver function, glycemic control, cholesterol, or body weight when compared with placebo (109561).\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral rosemary is beneficial for opioid withdrawal when used in combination with methadone.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking rosemary leaf along with methadone for 2 weeks improves symptoms of opioid withdrawal and the ability to sleep when compared with methadone alone after 3 and 7 days of treatment, but not after 2 weeks. Rosemary leaf was provided in capsules containing 300 mg each (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company) at a dose of 16 capsules daily for the first 3 days, 12 capsules daily for the next 4 days, and eight capsules daily for the next 7 days, in divided doses (91727).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows subjective reductions in pain associated with osteoarthritis when oral formulations containing rosemary leaf extract, oleanolic acid from olive leaf, and rho iso-alpha acids from hops (NG440-2, Metagenics; Meta050, Metagenics) are used (18326, 18327). The formulation used in one of these studies (Meta050, Metagenics) was taken in a dose of 440 mg three times daily for 4 weeks, then 880 mg twice daily for 4 weeks (18327). The formulation used in the other study, which was taken daily for 4 weeks, contained rosemary leaf extract 112.5 mg, oleanolic acid from olive leaf 1 mg, and rho iso-alpha acids from hops 225 mg per tablet (18326).\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. It is unclear if topical rosemary essential oil is beneficial in patients with Raynaud syndrome.\nA very small, open-label study in patients with Raynaud syndrome caused by systemic scleroderma shows that applying 10 drops of rosemary 10% essential oil to the hands does not increase skin temperature or improve warmth perception when compared with olive oil (109560). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows subjective decreases in pain associated with RA when oral formulations containing rosemary leaf extract, oleanolic acid from olive leaf, and rho iso-alpha acids from hops (NG440-2, Metagenics; Meta050, Metagenics) are used (18326, 18327). The formulation used in one of these studies (Meta050, Metagenics) was taken in a dose of 440 mg three times daily for 4 weeks, then 880 mg twice daily for 4 weeks (18327). The formulation used in the other study, which was taken daily for 4 weeks, contained rosemary leaf extract 112.5 mg, oleanolic acid from olive leaf 1 mg, and rho iso-alpha acids from hops 225 mg per tablet (18326).\nless\nStress. It is unclear if rosemary aromatherapy is beneficial for stress.\nPreliminary clinical research on the use of rosemary aromatherapy for anxiety and stress is conflicting. In a group of graduate nursing students, perceived stress associated with taking a test was lower when inhalers containing rosemary or lavender oil were used. Three drops of rosemary essential oil were added to an inhaler and inhaled before and during the test. Pulse rates, but not blood pressure, were also reduced (18324). In contrast, a small clinical study in adults aged 18-30 years shows that the aroma from diluted rosemary essential oil applied to the wrist during timed crossword puzzle completion actually increases subjective feelings of anxiety and tension when compared with placebo (18325).\nless\nSunburn. Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of rosemary and grapefruit extracts in a 1:1 ratio (NutroxSun, Monteloeder, Inc.), 250 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks, increases the amount of UV radiation needed to cause sunburn by 34% after 8 weeks and 56% after 12 weeks when compared to baseline (91728). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Oral rosemary has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial among healthy adults shows that taking a combination product containing rosemary leaf extract, aloe gel powder, and poria mushroom extract daily for 8 weeks does not reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of URTI-related symptoms when compared with placebo. However, in patients receiving an influenza vaccine midway through the study, this product does seem to improve some immune response biomarkers when compared with placebo (111921). The amount of rosemary leaf extract in the supplement was not disclosed.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical rosemary cream is beneficial for wound healing.\nA moderate-sized clinical trial among primiparous adults with medio-lateral episiotomy shows that applying a cream containing rosemary extract to the wound twice daily for 10 days improves episiotomy wound healing and reduces redness and discharge when compared with placebo cream (112143).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate rosemary for these uses.",

Additionally, the camphor constituent of rosemary can sometimes lead to seizures (4).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with rosemary.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, the rosemary constituent luteolin, as well as derivatives of various constituents, were found in the plasma following consumption of rosemary tea (105325). Animal research shows that the absolute bioavailability of rosmarinic acid following topical administration is 60% (71890).\nDistribution\nDistribution of rosmarinic acid following intravenous administration in rat has been described by a two-compartment open model. One half-hour after injection, rosmarinic acid was detected and measured in brain, heart, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, and bone tissue (71890). Four and a half hours after topical administration, rosmarinic acid was measured in blood, skin, muscle, and bone tissue (71890).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, some constituents of rosemary, including rosmarinic acid, are metabolized by colonic microbiota to metabolites such as caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acid. Caffeic acid and other constituents or metabolites are metabolized in plasma to glucuronidated or sulfated phase II derivatives (105325).\nExcretion\nIn humans, rosemary constituents, including rosmarinic acid and caffeic acids, as well as derivatives of various constituents, were found in the urine following consumption of rosemary tea (105325). In an animal study, following the intravenous administration of rosmarinic acid, the elimination half-life was 1.8 hours (71890).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of rosemary is the leaf. The active constituent of the leaf is the essential oil. The dried leaves contain 0.6% to 2.5% of the essential oil (4, 5, 18246). The oil consists primarily of 1,8-cineole, borneol, camphor, carvacrol, and alpha-pinene (4, 6, 18246). Other constituents include phenolic diterpenes, flavones, the caffeic acid derivative rosmarinic acid, the triterpene ursolic acid, other terpenes such as verbenone, and carnosic acid (18246, 71757, 98532, 98540, 105325, 105326).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that rosemary extract can inhibit the activity of human leukocyte elastase, which plays a role in inflammation (71949). Other in vitro research shows that the rosemary constituent rosmanol inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced induction of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (71872). The rosemary constituents carnosic acid and carnosol appear to inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (71832). Ursolic acid from rosemary is thought to inhibit the activation of nuclear transcription factor kappaB (31374). Some animal research suggests that intratracheal exposure to rosemary extract can prevent allergic airway inflammation by inhibiting the expression of interleukin (IL)-13 (71765). However, in human research, rosemary had no effect on plasma levels of most inflammatory mediators (105326).\nAnticancer effects\nAnimal research suggests that rosemary extract can decrease carcinogen-induced tumor incidence, tumor burden, and tumor yield (71782, 71785, 71914). The rosemary extract and some constituents, such as carnosic acid, appear to inhibit the proliferation and possibly induce apoptosis of leukemia cells (71699, 71804, 71836). Other in vitro research suggests that rosmarinic acid, a constituent of rosemary, reduces the expression of the pro-inflammatory gene cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This gene is thought to be a risk factor for cancer development (71844). Rosemary extract and rosemary essential oil may also reduce cancer development by protecting DNA from oxidative damage; this is attributed to phenolic constituents of rosemary (71672, 71694, 71698). In addition, rosemary polyphenols may reduce the activation of procarcinogens and increase detoxification pathways (71920). Other cell culture research suggests that the rosemary constituent carnosol inhibits cancer cell metastasis by decreasing the activity of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (71751).\nAnticoagulant/antiplatelet effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that rosemary inhibits platelet aggregation (18334, 18335, 18336, 18337).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research shows that intramuscular injections of rosemary leaf oil can increase plasma glucose and decrease insulin secretion in healthy rabbits (71910). However, other animal research shows that rosemary extract can decrease blood glucose levels and increase serum insulin concentrations in diabetic rabbits and mice (71821, 71923). Cell culture research suggests that rosemary extract may lower blood glucose levels by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The effect is attributed to the constituents carnosol and carnosic acid (71783). Other cell culture research shows that rosemary may have alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This effect is attributed to the constituent rosmarinic acid (67226).\nAntimicrobial effects\nVarious cell culture studies show that rosemary essential oil and rosemary extract have antibacterial activity against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, including some drug-resistant strains and food-borne pathogens, as well as activity against some species of yeast and fungus including Candida albicans (13453, 31330, 43430, 43486, 71717, 71739, 71757, 71774, 71798, 71814)(71833, 71837). Rosemary essential oil also appears to inhibit the of growth and aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus (46242). Rosemary essential oils with the highest quantity of camphor, borneol, and verbenone constituents appear to exert the highest antimicrobial activity (71757). Rosemary extract containing carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosmarinic acid appears to have the highest antimicrobial activity (71774). Some in vitro research suggests that rosemary extract can inhibit bacteria biofilm adhesion or biofilm production (68505, 71833, 71840). However, other research suggests that rosemary does not display antifungal activity against Candida species (52026). Furthermore, some research has shown that rosemary extract can act as a substrate for mycelial growth, sporulation, and aflatoxin production (39827).\nAntinociceptive effects\nRosemary oil extract administration in mice reduced the number of writhing movements induced by the intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid solution and inhibited licking and shaking behaviors in both the early (neurogenic pain) and late (inflammatory pain) phases of the formalin test (71791). These effects may be modulated by the serotonin system (i.e., 5-HT1A receptors) or the endogenous opioid system (71853).\nAntiobesity effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that rosemary leaf extract may prevent weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity (71875). Cell culture research shows that the rosemary constituents carnosic acid and carnosol inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (71857). In vitro research also shows that rosemary extract inhibits digestive enzymes (98532).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research shows that rosemary extract may have antioxidant effects in aged rats (71858). Some evidence suggests that the antioxidant effects of phenolic constituents of rosemary may help preserve food (71725, 71745). The antioxidant effects of rosemary extract is primary attributed to the phenolic diterpenes, carnosol and carnosic acid (18246, 71692, 71693, 71724, 71906, 71909). Rosmarinic acid also appears to have antioxidant effects (57869). The antioxidant effects of rosemary may be weaker than vitamin C but stronger than vitamin E (71889). Cooking and storage can affect the antioxidant capacity of rosemary (49470).\nAntiparasitic effects\nRosemary leaf extract inhibits the motility of epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro. The trypanocidal effect is attributed to the constituent ursolic acid (71707).\nAntiviral activity\nIn vitro research shows that rosemary extract, and the constituents carnosol, carnosic acid, and rosmanol, inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, possibly by inhibiting HIV-1 protease and HIV-1 virus replication (71663, 71912). Rosemary extract has also shown antiviral activity against herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2, and an acyclovir-resistant strain of herpes simplex type 1 (68447, 68488, 71951). Rosemary appears to inhibit herpes simplex virus adsorption not intracellular virus replication (68447).\nBone effects\nAnimal research shows that rosemary, rosemary essential oil, and monoterpene components of rosemary inhibit bone resorption when added to the food of rats (71716).\nCardiovascular effects\nRosemary might also have a positive inotropic effect on the heart and increases coronary blood flow (2). However, conflicting evidence suggests that rosemary oil might have negative inotropic effects (91730). In vitro research shows that the rosemary constituent carnosic acid can inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity. The activation of MMP-9 and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis development (71824). Other in vitro research shows that rosemary extract has angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (67226).\nDermatologic effects\nIt is not clear how rosemary oil works in alopecia areata, although there is some evidence that it might irritate the skin and increase blood circulation (2, 5177). Rosemary may also increase microcapillary perfusion, increasing hair follicle blood supply (91729).\n\nRosemary has also been evaluated for protecting against sun damage. In vitro research suggests that rosemary extract inhibits UV-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) gene transcription when applied to skin cells. Upregulation of MMP-1 gene transcription has been shown to be involved in the development of skin photodamage (71830). Rosemary extract may also protect against UV-induced photodamage by reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species and absorbing and scattering UVB radiation (91728). The rosemary polyphenols rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, and carnosol are thought to induce these photoprotective effect (91728).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe essential oil might have a spasmolytic effect on smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract and in the ducts of the gallbladder (4).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that rosemary can reduce carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity, possibly by reducing oxidative stress (71672, 71697, 71703, 71870, 71893).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nRosemary has been shown to increase the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduce the production of leukotriene B4 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as inhibit the complement system (44390).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nIn humans, rosemary intake for 10 days increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is thought to be involved in the regulation of the neuroimmune axis of depression (105326). Preliminary data suggest that rosemary might inhibit cholinesterases and have a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons (18246, 68163, 71839). It may also have antidepressant effects, mediated via the monoaminergic system, and antinociceptive effects, mediated via the endogenous opioid system and inhibited by naloxone (18246, 71856). Cell culture research suggests that rosemary extract may enhance the production of nerve growth factor in glioblastoma cells, which might improve the growth and function of nerve tissue (71731). Rosemary may also protect neurons from oxidative stress (71819, 71880).\nOpioid withdrawal effects\nRosemary may reduce symptoms of withdrawal by inducing GABA. Furthermore, analgesic effects of aqueous and alcoholic extract of rosemary have been antagonized by naloxone. This may imply its interaction with opioid receptors and its antinociceptive effects (18246, 91727)."

In severe cases, royal jelly can cause status asthmaticus, anaphylaxis, and death (792, 7315, 7316, 10623, 10624, 108511). Allergic symptoms are associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (3513, 10623).\n\nTopically, skin irritation, exacerbation of dermatitis, or contact dermatitis may occur (791).\n\nFrom occupational exposure, royal jelly can cause allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma (95868).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nThere is one report of dizziness in a patient who took a combination product containing royal jelly, bee pollen extract, and a bee pollen plus pistil extract (12008).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMenopausal symptoms. Several clinical studies suggest that oral royal jelly, taken alone or in combination with other ingredients, modestly improves menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if topical royal jelly is beneficial for this use.\nOne clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking royal jelly 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces menopausal symptom scores by around 30% when compared with placebo (102527). Other small clinical studies show that taking one to two capsules of a specific combination product containing royal jelly and flower pollen (Melbrosia) daily for 12 weeks reduces menopausal symptoms and improves feelings of well-being when compared with baseline or placebo (18064, 71956, 72005). Another clinical trial in postmenopausal patients shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product containing royal jelly, evening primrose oil, damiana, and ginseng (Lady 4) daily for 4 weeks decreases self-rated menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo (21003).\n\nTopical royal jelly has also been evaluated. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that applying vaginal cream containing royal jelly 15% daily for 12 weeks improves quality of life, sexual problems, and urinary problems similarly to vaginal estrogen cream 0.625 mg. However, estrogen cream improves vaginal atrophy better than royal jelly (92884).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral royal jelly does not appear to prevent or treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children.\nA clinical trial in children 5-16 years of age with allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific royal jelly product (Bidro) 150 mg twice daily for 3-6 months before and during pollen season does not prevent or treat nasal congestion, sneezing, or eye discomfort when compared with placebo (71968).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral royal jelly does not appear to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMost clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes, along with a meta-analysis of five small clinical trials including patients with or without type 2 diabetes, shows that taking royal jelly 0.5-6 grams daily for 4-8 weeks does not improve markers of glycemic control such as fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (92879, 92880, 92881, 102529).\nless\nPhysical performance. Oral royal jelly does not appear to improve physical performance in elderly nursing home residents.\nA clinical trial in elderly nursing home residents shows that taking royal jelly 1.2 grams or 4.8 grams daily for one year does not improve hand grip strength, walking, or ability to stand on one leg when compared with placebo (95870).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAndrogenic alopecia. Although there has been interest in using topical royal jelly for androgenic alopecia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of royal jelly for this purpose.\nAtherosclerosis. Although there has been interest in using oral royal jelly for atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of royal jelly for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. Oral royal jelly has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTwo small clinical trials in elite male swimmers and runners show that taking royal jelly 400 mg and coenzyme Q10 60 mg daily for 10 days does not improve high-intensity interval training performance when compared with placebo (109992, 109993). These studies were small and may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for improving cancer-related fatigue.\nA small clinical study in patients with solid (nonhematologic) malignancies shows that taking 5 mL of processed honey and royal jelly twice daily for 4 weeks reduces fatigue when compared with 5 mL of honey alone (92877).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for preventing acral erythema from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nOne small clinical trial in patients receiving TKI therapy for renal cell carcinoma shows that taking royal jelly 900 mg four times daily for 3 months does not reduce the risk of acral erythema when compared with placebo (105773). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for preventing hepatotoxicity from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nOne small clinical trial in patients receiving TKI therapy for renal cell carcinoma shows that taking royal jelly 900 mg four times daily for 3 months does not reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity when compared with placebo (105773). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for preventing chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving two cycles of cisplatin therapy shows that taking royal jelly capsules daily may attenuate increases in serum creatinine and urea levels when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear if this effect is clinically significant; the increased levels that occurred in the placebo group were still within normal limits (95871). The validity of these results is also limited by the short study duration and lack of statistical comparison between groups. Another small clinical trial in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for renal cell carcinoma shows that taking royal jelly 900 mg four times daily for 3 months does not reduce the risk of kidney dysfunction when compared with placebo (105773). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for preventing fatigue from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nOne small clinical trial in patients receiving TKI therapy for renal cell carcinoma shows that taking royal jelly 900 mg four times daily for 3 months reduces the frequency of chemotherapy-related fatigue when compared with placebo (105773, 105774).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral royal jelly has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a specific combination product (Memo, Pharco Pharmaceuticals), which contains natural lyophilized royal jelly 750 mg, ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg, and Panax ginseng root extract 150 mg, daily for 4 weeks improves cognitive ability when compared with placebo (89712).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral royal jelly has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults without diabetes in Iran hospitalized with moderately severe COVID-19 receiving corticosteroids shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Tang Forte, HealthAid) containing royal jelly extract 350 mg and vitamin E 2 mg daily for 7 days does not improve markers of the clinical course of COVID-19, such as oxygen saturation or length of hospital stay, when compared with placebo (114535). However, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. It is unclear if this effect is due to royal jelly, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Small clinical studies suggest that topical application of royal jelly plus panthenol may improve healing of diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical royal jelly alone is beneficial for this use.\nOne small clinical study shows that applying royal jelly 5% to a wound after conventional cleansing and debriding three times weekly for 3 months does not improve the healing of diabetic foot ulcers when compared with placebo (92882). However, other small clinical studies show that applying 1-3 grams of a specific combination ointment (Pedyphar) containing royal jelly and panthenol after conventional cleansing and debriding procedures twice weekly for up to 6 months may improve the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (71980, 102526). In one of these studies, the rate of complete healing of life-threatening ulcers was 2.7-fold greater with this combination ointment when compared with panthenol alone (102526). Possible reasons for these discrepancies include the use of combination versus single ingredient ointments and the duration of treatment.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial in patients with dry eye.\nA small clinical trial in Japanese patients with dry eye shows that taking enzyme-treated royal jelly 2.4 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve tear stability or dry eye symptoms when compared with placebo (95869).\nless\nFractures. Although there has been interest in using oral royal jelly for healing of fractures, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of royal jelly for this purpose.\nHepatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral royal jelly for hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of royal jelly for this purpose.\nMale infertility. Intravaginal application of royal jelly has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in couples experiencing infertility due to asthenozoospermia shows that applying a saline solution containing royal jelly 3 grams, Egyptian bee honey 100 grams, and bee bread 1 teaspoon intravaginally before or after intercourse, starting one day after menstruation and continuing for 2 weeks, can increase the rate of pregnancy when compared with intrauterine insemination (55131). It is unclear if this effect is due to royal jelly, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for reducing body weight in patients who are overweight or obese.\nOne small clinical study in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking fresh royal jelly 1 gram daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight by around 2 kg and body mass index (BMI) by around 0.7 kg/m2, as well as carbohydrate and total energy intake, when compared with placebo. However, the improvement is modest and may not be clinically significant (92878). Another small clinical study in overweight adults shows that taking royal jelly 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, or appetite when compared with placebo (102528). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes.\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for preventing or treating oral mucositis in patients receiving radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.\nOne small clinical trial in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy shows that swishing and swallowing royal jelly 1 gram in two divided doses daily, in addition to standard rinses with benzydamine and nystatin, improves healing time of mild or moderate oral mucositis when compared with standard rinses alone (95867).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial in patients with osteoporosis.\nA small clinical trial in postmenopausal adults shows that taking royal jelly powder 1000 mg, equivalent to 3000 mg of fresh royal jelly, daily for 6 months maintains bone mineral density (BMD) in the proximal femur and lumbar spine, while patients taking placebo saw significant reductions in lumbar spine BMD. Also, markers of bone turnover were significantly reduced with placebo, while significant changes in these markers were lacking in patients taking royal jelly (105775). It is unclear whether these findings can be generalized to patients with documented osteoporosis.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral royal jelly for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of royal jelly for this purpose.\nPost-stroke fatigue. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for alleviating post-stroke fatigue.\nA small clinical study in adults with recent ischemic stroke shows that taking royal jelly 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce post-stroke fatigue when compared with placebo (115548). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral royal jelly, taken alone or in combination with other ingredients, is beneficial in patients with PMS.\nA small clinical study in healthy college students shows that taking royal jelly 1 gram daily starting on the first day of menstruation and continuing for two consecutive menstrual cycles improves PMS symptoms when compared with placebo (95873). However, methodological flaws associated with the study limit the validity of these results. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (Femal, Natumin Pharma), providing royal jelly 12 mg, bee pollen extract 72 mg, and bee pollen plus pistil extract 240 mg, twice daily over 2 menstrual cycles seems to decrease some symptoms of PMS including irritability, weight increases, and edema (12008). It is unclear if these effects are due to royal jelly, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial in patients with renal cell carcinoma.\nOne small clinical trial in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for renal cell carcinoma shows that taking royal jelly 900 mg four times daily for 3 months reduces tumor size, improves chemotherapy-related fatigue and anorexia, and reduces the need for dose reduction or the discontinuation of therapy when compared with placebo (105773, 105774). Royal jelly does not seem to reduce other TKI-related adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms, oral mucositis, acral erythema, anemia, hepatotoxicity, or nephrotoxicity, when compared with placebo (105773). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes.\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral royal jelly is beneficial for improving post-stroke complications.\nA small clinical study in adults with recent ischemic stroke shows that taking royal jelly 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves cognitive function and appetite, but not fatigue, depression, or anxiety, when compared with placebo (115548).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate royal jelly for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with royal jelly.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nA large proportion of the medium-chain fatty acids present in royal jelly are 10-hydroxydecanoic acid, 10-hydroxy-2-decanoic acid, and sebacic acid. These bind to proteins in the gastrointestinal lumen, reducing their absorption. Pretreating royal jelly with protease enzymes increases absorption and the area under the concentration-time curve for these fatty acids (109994).\nMetabolism\nThe major fatty acids present in royal jelly undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver to dicarboxylic acids which are then absorbed into the circulation (109994).\nExcretion\nFatty acid metabolites such as 2-decenedioic acid, sebacic acid, and 3-hydroxysebacic acid are excreted in the urine with half-lives of about 1-1.5 hours (109994).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRoyal jelly is a milky secretion produced by glands in the heads of nurse honey bees (Apis mellifera). It is used for the development and nurturing of queen bees. The composition of royal jelly varies with geographical areas and climate. It typically contains about 60% to 70% water, 9% to 18% proteins, 7.5% to 23% sugars, 3% to 8% lipids, and 2% to 3% low molecular weight compounds such as vitamins, salts, and free amino acids (6, 7313, 92883). Medium-chain fatty acids comprise 60% to 80% of the lipids present and include 10-hydroxydecanoic acid and 10-hydroxy-2-decanoic acid, which are unique to royal jelly. Other compounds present include flavonoids and phenolic compounds (109992, 109994).\nAdipocyte effects\nIn vitro, protein fractions of royal jelly increased the percent of mature adipocytes in a preadipocyte culture (71966).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, royal jelly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated macrophages (71962). Flavonoids that are capable of inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity may contribute to royal jelly's anti-inflammatory activity (92882).\nAntiaging effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly reduced tissue DNA oxidative damage and increased life span (71960).\nAntiallergy effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly had antiallergic effects in a mouse model of immediate hypersensitivity (71959). The major royal jelly protein 3 (MRJP3) was found to suppress IL-4, IL-2, and IFN-gamma production by T cells.\nAntiarrhythmic effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly protected against and reduced adrenaline-induced arrhythmia (72016).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a diabetic animal model, there was decrease in blood pressure and a significant reduction in serum levels of insulin (72018, 71987). Royal jelly may have insulin like peptide activity which may improve insulin resistance (92879).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, royalisin, a protein in royal jelly, had antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative bacteria (72014, 71995). In vitro, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of royal jelly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4% (72015). The addition of honey increased the antibacterial effects. In vitro, jelleines-I-III had antimicrobial effects (71965). Jelleines I-IV may have effects against yeast, gram-negative, and gram-positive bacteria. Royalisin may also exert bacteriostatic and antimicrobial activities (92885).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn tumor cells in vitro, royal jelly inhibited N-acetylation and metabolism of 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) (72017). In vitro, protein fractions of royal jelly were cytotoxic to cancer cells (71966). In vitro, royal jelly inhibited the bisphenol A-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cancer cells; however, it was without effect in the absence of bisphenol A (71972).\nAntioxidant effects\nEnzymatic hydrolysates of royal jelly had antioxidant effects in vitro (71971). In vivo and in vitro, peptides from royal jelly inhibited lipid peroxidation (71984). Possible antioxidant mechanisms include tyrosyl dipeptides that have antioxidant activity in vitro which scavenge free radicals. Royal jelly may upregulate glutathione-s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase genes (92879). Royal jelly may also possess scavenging abilities of the superoxide radical (92881).\nCardiovascular effects\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking royal jelly 690 mg daily for 4 weeks improves vascular endothelial function when compared with placebo, suggesting that royal jelly may have anti-atherogenic effects (108512).\nChemoprotective effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly protected against the mutagenic effects of doxorubicin and/or cobalt gamma radiation (72021). Royal jelly reduced DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aberrations.\nDermatological effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly inhibits the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions and slows aging-related skin damage by increasing collagen production (72029, 109995). A small study in healthy humans shows that applying a royal jelly extract in a topical formulation to the face twice daily for 4 weeks increases the moisture content of the stratum corneum when compared with placebo, but does not affect trans epidermal water evaporation, pigmentation, redness, or pore size (109995).\nErgogenic effects\nIn animal research, a protein from royal jelly reduced fatigue and accumulation of serum lactate and ammonia associated with a forced swim (71957). In humans, a combination of royal jelly and coenzyme Q10 reduce lipid peroxidation and muscle damage associated with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It also attenuates exercise-induced increases in plasma and saliva levels of diene conjugates, Schiff bases, and creatine kinase (109992). The combination also reduces blood lactate levels and the increase in heart rate associated with HIIT (109993).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome clinical and animal research suggests that royal jelly might have hepatoprotective effects (71985, 108512). In healthy adults, taking royal jelly 690 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces some markers of liver injury when compared with placebo (108512). In animals, royal jelly protects against acetaminophen-induced liver damage (71985). The mechanism of royal jelly's hepatoprotective effects is unclear.\nHormonal effects\nRoyal jelly has been used for hormone-depended conditions such as menopause due to its purported hormonal effects. In clinical research, taking 3000 mg royal jelly daily for 6 months resulted in increased testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in healthy volunteers over 40 years old (71994). However, in another clinical study in healthy adults, taking royal jelly 350 mg daily for 3 months did not affect testosterone or estradiol levels but did seem to increase DHEA levels compared to baseline (95866). In vitro, royal jelly activated estrogen receptors, resulting in enhanced transcription of a reporter gene through an estrogen-responsive element and stimulated the expression of mRNA coding for estrogen-responsive pS2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (71967). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that royal jelly competes with 17beta-estradiol for binding to the human estrogen receptor alpha and beta. The estrogen receptor modulation may be derived from fatty acids found in royal jelly, such as 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (92883). Tamoxifen blocked the royal jelly-induced enhancement of MCF-7 cell proliferation. In an ovariectomized rat model, royal jelly restored VEGF expression in the uterus.\nHypolipidemic effects\nRoyal jelly has been shown to improve total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in healthy patients and postmenopausal adults, perhaps by decreasing levels of VLDL (71977, 92883). In animal research, royal jelly decreased the gene expression of squalene epoxidase (cholesterol biosynthesis) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREB)-1, and increased the gene expression of the LDL receptor (71975). Royal jelly also seems to interact with bile acids in the gut and inhibit their absorption, leading to an increase in fecal excretion of both bile acids and cholesterol. Royal jelly also contains medium chain fatty acids which are absorbed via the portal system, providing quick energy to the liver, reducing glucose requirements. Medium chain fatty acids upregulate the CYP7A1 gene in the liver, encoding a rate limiting enzyme for the transformation of cholesterol into bile acids and subsequent excretion through the feces (92883).\nHypotensive effects</strong>\nIn vitro, a royal jelly-derived peptide (dipeptide YY) inhibited human renin activity (71982). In animal research, peptides from royal jelly decreased blood pressure in a hypertensive model (71982, 71963). In a diabetic animal model, there was a tendency to decrease blood pressure (72018).\nImmune effects\nIn vitro, royal jelly induced proliferation of lymphocytes (71974). Royal jelly also increased the release of IFN-gamma and decreased TNF-alpha. There were also significant differences in the ratios of IFN-gamma/IL-4 and IFN-gamma/IL-10. When lymphocytes from patients with Graves' disease were used, the T-helper (Th)1:Th2 cytokine ratio was shifted to the side of Th1 cytokine, and there was a decrease in the TSHR antibody levels in lymphocyte cell culture supernatants.\n\nIn vitro, royal jelly stimulated T cell proliferation and increased IL-2 production at lower concentrations (72020). Higher concentrations, however, inhibited T cell proliferation and decreased IL-2 production.\n\nIn animal research, royal jelly delayed the onset of systemic autoimmunity, including decreased proteinuria and reduced renal symptoms (72019). There was a decrease in serum level of IL-10, as well as autoantibodies against ssDNA, dsDNA, and erythrocytes, and the number of splenic autoreactive B cells.\n\nA synthetic derivative of the royal jelly organic acid 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, 1-(2-methoxyethoxymethyl)2,3-(10-hydroxy2-decenoyl)(E) glycerol, was found to induce NF-kappaB translocation following IkappaB-alpha proteolysis, and it also activated sphingomyelinase (71958). Neopterin, found in royal jelly, is reported to have immunological effects (71955).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn adults with recent ischemic stroke, royal jelly increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (115548). In vitro, royal jelly and its 10-hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic acid increased the generation of neurons and decreased the generation of astrocytes from neural stem/progenitor cells (71978).\nVasodilating effects\nIn animal research, a water-soluble fraction of royal jelly had vasodilating effects on dog femoral artery (72022). Also, in a diabetic animal model, royal jelly reduced the sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstrictor response to periarterial nerve stimulation, as well as the potentiation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide nerve-mediated vasodilator response to periarterial nerve stimulation in isolated and perfused mesenteric vascular beds. Effects on norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction and calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced vasodilation were lacking (72018, 71987).\nWeight effects\nRoyal jelly may increase oxygen metabolism, respiration, and oxidative phosphorylation. 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid may induce thermogenesis and increase energy expenditure. It may also inhibit pancreatic lipase activity leading to decreased fat absorption from the intestine (92878).\nWound healing effects\nIn animal research, royal jelly lacked benefit on healing following tympanic membrane perforation; however, use of royal jelly increased the thickness of the membranes by increasing the organization of the connective tissue (72023). A component originally labeled honeybee royal jelly-derived collagen production-promoting factor (HRJ-CPF) was found to be 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid; 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid increased collagen production in vitro by a mechanism using TGF-beta 1(71964). In animal models, royal jelly dilates the vascular system and facilitates blood flow in the vascular beds of the lower limbs. 10-hydroxydecenoic acid is a fatty acid that induces the fibroblast cell line to produce transforming growth factor-beta1, which is an important factor for collagen production. It also activates keratinocytes and matrix metalloproteinase 9 which may accelerate the wound healing process (92882)."

It is unclear if topical rutin is beneficial for aging skin.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of a cream containing rutin 2% twice daily for 4 weeks reduces signs of skin aging around the eye in females aged 30-50 years. Skin dermal density is improved by 20%, area of crow's feet is reduced by 26%, and the number of wrinkles under the eye is reduced by 53% when compared with placebo (92236).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Oral rutin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 4-10 years-old with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking a product containing rutin 3 mg/kg, luteolin 10 mg/kg, and quercetin 7 mg/kg daily for 26 weeks improves aspects of behavior, such as hyperactivity, irritability, and lethargy, by a moderate to large amount when compared to baseline. It also seems to improve some indices of functioning, such as daily living and social behavior, by a small amount. These improvements were considered to be greater than expected when taking aging into consideration; however, no placebo was used in this study (96765).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral rutin is beneficial for diabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes conducted in Iran shows that taking rutin 500 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin by approximately 40 mg/dL and 1%, respectively, and modestly reduces triglycerides and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with placebo (112182). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the omission of data regarding concurrent diabetes medications. A small observational study in patients with a family history of type 1 diabetes shows that taking a specific product (Mucos Pharma) containing rutin 100 mg, trypsin 48 mg, and bromelain 90 mg daily for 24 months is not associated with reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes at 8 years (99472).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections.

Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with primary or secondary lymphedema of the upper or lower limbs shows that taking a combination product containing rutin 300 mg, bromelain 100 mg, and sweet clover 100 mg daily for 6 months decreases pitting, limb volume, pain, and quality of life when compared to baseline (103298). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to rutin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral rutin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking an enzyme combination containing rutin 100 mg, trypsin 48 mg, and bromelain 90 mg per tablet for at least 3 months does not affect the progression of disability, relapse rate, or central nervous system lesions when compared with placebo (99468). The validity of these results are limited by the short duration of treatment.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral rutin is beneficial for obesity.\nIn Japanese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 23-30 kg/m2, a small clinical trial shows that taking a specific monoglucosyl rutin ( αG Rutin PS) 200 mg or 400 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces the area of visceral fat by 2.4 cm and 3.5 cm, respectively, compared with an increase of 5.2 cm in those taking placebo.

It appears that quercetin from rutin is absorbed better in females than in males, although these differences in bioavailability are not completely understood. Although plasma levels of quercetin increase after treatment with either rutin or quercetin, the time to maximal concentration is approximately 3-5 hours shorter following quercetin treatment versus rutin treatment (9442). When applied topically, rutin is poorly absorbed. Loading rutin into phospholipid-based ethosomes increases dermal absorption (99260).\nMetabolism\nIn plasma, quercetin derived from rutin in the gastrointestinal tract is found as glucuronides and/or sulfates (9442).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nRutin is a type of flavonoid. It is in the flavonol family (92233, 92236).\nAnti-fatigue effects\nIn an animal model, rutin appears to reduce fatigue and associated anxiety; the antioxidant effects of rutin may play a role (92233).\nAnti-fungal effects\nAlthough rutin alone does not have anti-fungal effects in vitro, rutin reduces the amount of amphotericin B required to achieve the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against certain strains of fungi (92238).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of rutin are thought to play a role in some of its clinical effects. In an animal model of retinal and optic nerve injury, rutin reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (99259). However, in men, taking rutin for 3 weeks as part of a formulation with bromelain and trypsin did not reduce levels of inflammatory markers following a marathon (96766).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn an animal diabetic model, rutin reduces levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, and has beneficial effects on blood lipids (105299). Rutin appears to aid in the reparation of the pancreatic islet cells and stimulate glucose uptake from the blood. The antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity of rutin possibly plays a role in these effects (92233, 105299).\nAntioxidant effects\nRutin is thought to be an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger, and an iron-chelator (209, 3100, 31668, 92233, 96767, 99258, 99260). Some studies suggest that the antioxidant effects of rutin might offer protection from damage induced by asbestos, kainic, or acrylamide (209, 3103, 92233), cytotoxic effects of oxidized low density lipoproteins (11, 3105), gastric injury from ethanol (3107), retinal and optic nerve injury from cisplatin (99259), and ultraviolet A radiation (96767, 99258).\nCancer effects\nWhen added to the diet of animals, rutin appears to offer some protection against DNA damage caused by hepatocarcinogens (3104), and rutin has cytotoxic effects on cancer cells in vitro (92233). However, preliminary evidence in animal research suggests rutin might worsen the progression of melanoma (211).\nCapillary effects\nIt has been reported that rutin might decrease capillary fragility and permeability, although the existing evidence is inconclusive (11).\nDermatologic effects\nIn human research, topically applied rutin improves skin elasticity. This is possibly due to increased production of collagen and decreased collagen breakdown as shown in vitro (92236). Also, rutin has antioxidant effects on the skin when applied topically (99260).\nGastrointestinal effects\nEarly evidence in animal models suggests that rutin might be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease. The antioxidative effects of rutin may play a role (3101, 3102).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn animal research, rutin appears to reduce the hepatotoxic effects of a high cholesterol diet, possibly by inhibiting a specific hepatotoxic signaling pathway involving transforming growth factor beta (92234).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal models, the spatial improvement associated with rutin appears to be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, possibly resulting in reduced levels of oligomeric amyloid beta levels and impacts on the synaptophysin and dopaminergic pathways. Nitric oxide modulation may play a role in some of its neuroprotective effects (92233). Also, in an animal model of phenytoin treatment for seizure control, rutin appears to protect cognitive function. The mechanism of action is not clear; however, rutin also reverses the phenytoin-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase activity (92237).\nVascular effects\nIn an animal model of carotid artery occlusion, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of rutin appeared to play a role in the prevention of cognitive deficits. Vascular inflammation is also reduced (92233).\nWeight loss effects\nRutin is of interest for weight loss. In an animal model, a monoglucosyl form of rutin supressed the secretion of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) (105298)."

Some research shows that taking rye grass pollen extract might relieve some symptoms of CP/CPPS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking rye grass pollen extract (Cernilton) 126 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks improves pain, micturition, and quality of life scores, but not sexual symptoms or urine volume, when compared with placebo in patients with CP/CPPS (95162). Other low-quality clinical research also shows that taking rye grass pollen extract improves CP/CPPS symptoms when compared with baseline (5296, 5293).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral rye grass is beneficial in patients with constipation.\nOne small clinical study shows that consuming whole-grain rye bread 240 grams or more daily for 3 weeks improves intestinal transit time by 23% when compared with white bread in patients with constipation. Patients consuming rye bread reported an average of 1.4 more stools per week compared with no rye bread, along with improved stool softness and ease of defecation. Consuming rye bread also improved intestinal transit time by 41% when compared with various laxatives designed to increase fecal mass or have osmotic effects (95161).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate rye grass for this use.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nRye grass pollen extract is commonly taken at doses of 126 mg orally two to three times daily for up to 24 weeks (5292, 5293, 5294, 5295, 8176, 8520, 95162). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost clinical research has evaluated a specific rye grass pollen extract product known commercially as Cernilton or Graminex. These products contain cernitin T60, a water-soluble pollen extract primarily containing the extract of rye grass pollen, but also extracts of corn pollen and Phleum pratense pollen, and cernitin GBX, an acetone- or fat-soluble pollen extract of the same pollens. The water-soluble and fat soluble-extracts are used in a ratio of 20:1 with 60 mg of the water-soluble extract and 3 mg of the fat-soluble extract per capsule or tablet. These extracts contain carbohydrates, fat, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, as well as beta-sitosterols (8176, 95162, 95163).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with rye grass.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the pharmacokinetics of rye grass.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of rye grass is the grain and the pollen extract. Some rye grass pollen extracts are prepared by microbial digestion of the pollen, followed by water and acetone extraction. The extract contains beta-sterols (5290, 5295, 8176, 95163). Rye grass grain contains the compound arabinoxylan (95161).\nGastrointestinal effects\nRye grain is a source of fiber. Rye bread, containing rye grass, lowers fecal pH and increases fecal levels of short chain fatty acids, suggesting beneficial effects on colonic bacteria. Rye grass fiber serves as a food substrate for colonic bacteria and increases fecal mass and fecal propulsion. In human research, rye grass fiber also reduced the ability of colonic bacteria to create carcinogenic compounds from chemicals found naturally in foods (95161).\nProstate effects\nRye grass pollen extract seems to relax urethral smooth muscle tone and increase bladder muscle contraction. Some evidence suggests that it might affect alpha-adrenergic receptors and relax the internal and external bladder sphincter muscles (8176). The extract does not affect luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone (5292). Some evidence suggests that rye grass pollen extract might inhibit prostate cancer cell growth (5297). Other evidence suggests that it might interfere with inflammation by inhibiting the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (5298)."
