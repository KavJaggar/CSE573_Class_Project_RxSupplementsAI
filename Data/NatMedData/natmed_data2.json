The total alkaloid content in Acacia rigidula was shown to be around 0.025% (89656). Other researchers isolated 44 different alkaloids and amines from plant parts of Acacia rigidula. The amine N-methyl-phenethylamine was the most abundant constituent isolated from Acacia rigidula. Other amines and alkaloids included pipecolamide, phenethylamine, tyramine, 4-methyl-2-pyridinamide, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, and N-methyltyramine. These, plus N-methyl-phenethylamine, represented around 88% of the amines and alkaloids found in Acacia rigidula during the spring season. Nicotine, mescaline, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and many other constituents were also identified (89657). The presence of amphetamine, which has never been isolated from plant sources, and many other synthetic compounds in this study has called into question the methods relied upon to accurately isolate and identify Acacia rigidula compounds (21078). A more recent study isolated and quantified the major amines in Acacia rigidula. Tyramine was the most abundant amine in Acacia rigidula leaves, while tryptamine was the most abundant in Acacia rigidula twigs. Phenethylamine was also identified in Acacia rigidula plant parts. While previous research identified N-methyl-phenethylamine as the major amine in Acacia rigidula, this study found only trace amounts present. Further, the presence of amphetamine was not detected. In addition to evaluating constituents in plant parts, these researchers isolated and quantified the amines present in Acacia rigidula dietary supplements. The amount of phenethylamine isolated from Acacia rigidula supplements was found to be greater than expected from plant parts alone. Further, almost half of the Acacia rigidula supplements tested were found to contain beta-methylphenethylamine (BMPEA). BMPEA is a synthetic compound that has not been isolated from Acacia rigidula. (21078). Additional research confirms that many supplements listing Acacia rigidula as an ingredient actually contain BMPEA. BMPEA is a less potent isomer of amphetamine and has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in rats and increase blood pressure and heart rate in cats and dogs (29823).\nCardiovascular effects\nMany supplements listing Acacia rigidula as an ingredient actually contain beta-methylphenethylamine.

Maximum serum concentrations of total anthocyanins from acai pulp and clarified acai juice have been shown to occur at 2.2 and 2 hours after ingestion, respectively (30243).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of acai is the fruit or berry. Acai juice is often prepared by macerating the fruit. The juice is viscous and contains about 2.4% protein and 5.9% lipids (13087). The fruit pulp contains about 4% protein and 12% lipids. Other nutrients include calcium, vitamin A, phosphorus, iron, and thiamine (13088, 15050). Acai berry contains several anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids (15051, 30240, 30241, 102859). The most abundant are cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-diglycoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, ferulic acid, epicatechin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, and pelargonidin-3-glucoside (30241, 30244, 30247, 30251). Others include cyanidin 3-sambubioside, peonidin 3-glucoside, and peonidin 3-rutinoside, gallic acid and several derivatives, catechin, and ellagic acid (13087, 15050, 30247). The anthocyanins are pigments that give the ripe fruit its purple color (13087, 30240). Acai berry also contains several fatty acids. The most abundant is the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic acid. The second most abundant is the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid. The third most abundant is the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid (15050, 15051, 30253).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in the anti-inflammatory properties of acai, which may be therapeutic for pro-inflammatory disease states such as metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. In vitro, a specific freeze-dried acai fruit pulp and skin powder (OptiAcai, K2A LLC) appears to inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 (15051). Also, acai has been shown to suppress the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on vascular endothelial cells (30250). Expression of VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells has been associated with early stages of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases (91558). However, not all acai supplement preparations have notable anti-inflammatory effects. In a small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome, drinking a beverage containing a total of 162.5 grams of acai pulp daily for 12 weeks did not affect high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) when compared with placebo. Acai also did not affect tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin-6, although it did decrease interferon-gamma when compared with placebo (99400). In another study, taking acai fruit pulp 200 grams daily for 4 weeks reduced levels of P-selectin, but not other cell adhesion molecules or interleukins (105322).\nAnticancer effects\nFractions of frozen acai pulp containing polyphenols seem to suppress the proliferation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells by promoting apoptosis (30240). Animal research shows that a diet containing 5% acai can reduce the development of esophageal tumors caused by N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine, a known carcinogen (30247). The chemopreventive effects was attributed to the ellagitannins in the berries.\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that acai seed extract may reduce blood glucose levels in obese mice (107847). Evidence from clinical research shows that consuming frozen acai pulp (Sambazon Acai Smoothie Pack) twice daily for one month reduces fasting glucose by 5.3% when compared to baseline (17731). The hypoglycemic effect was attributed to anthocyanin compounds in the pulp.\nAntioxidant effects\nAnthocyanins in acai are potent antioxidants (30240, 102859). Acai fruit pulp has a very high antioxidant capacity. It has more antioxidant content than cranberry, raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, or blueberry (13087). A specific freeze-dried acai fruit pulp and skin powder (OptiAcai, K2A LLC) has potent in vitro antioxidant activity against superoxide and peroxyl radicals that is higher than other fruits. However, it has only mild antioxidant activity against peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals (15051). In healthy humans, intake of acai juice or pulp has been shown to increase plasma antioxidant capacity by up to 3-fold. However, neither the pulp nor juice seem to reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (30243, 105321). Lipid peroxidation has been associated with cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases (91559, 91560). Clinical research shows that a specific juice blend containing acai pulp and other fruits and berries (MonaVie Active, MonaVie) reduces lipid peroxidation within two hours post-consumption (30244). However, a small clinical study in adults with chronic tinnitus shows that taking dried acai pulp extract 100 mg daily for 3 months does not reduce lipid peroxidation (107846).\n\nAcai seed has also been evaluated for antioxidant effects. Animal research in obese mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that taking acai seed extract reduces oxidative damage by decreasing levels of oxidative stress markers (e.g. 8-isoprostane) and increasing antioxidant levels (e.g. superoxidase and glutathione peroxidase) (107847).\nCardiovascular effects\nAcai is of interest for hyperlipidemia. Animal research in obese mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that consumption of acai seed extract may reduce body mass and cardiovascular remodeling and may have similar effects as rosuvastatin for reducing lipid parameters (107847). In healthy human adults, acai juice demonstrated a modest beneficial effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (105321).\nImmunostimulant effects\nIn vitro research shows that freeze-dried acai fruit pulp and skin powder (OptiAçai, K2A LLC) may increase macrophage activity. However, the effect does not seem to be dose-dependent, as low concentrations of the formulation appear to exert higher immunostimulatory action than higher concentrations (15051). Other in vitro research shows that acai polysaccharides may activate gamma delta T cell and myeloid cell activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (30249).\nNeurologic effects\nAnimal research shows that acai juice might have antidepressant and neuroprotective effects. In mice, acai juice ameliorated the depression-like behaviors and electromyographic changes induced by lipopolysaccharide. Additionally, acai juice increased the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA in the brain. TERT is an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomeres, and reduced expression of TERT is associated with depression and age-related cognitive changes, suggesting that acai might have neuroprotective effects. While the exact mechanism of these effects is unclear, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of acai is thought to play a role (102858)."

            "Overview": "Acerola is a hardy shrub or small tree with small pink flowers. It is native to northern South America, Central America, southern Mexico, and the Caribbean. It also grows in Florida and Texas, and in subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, and India (12651, 93207, 93208, 93209). The fruit is a deep red color when ripe, but it is thin-skinned, easily bruised, and lasts only 2-3 days at room temperature (93207, 93209). Brazil is the largest commercial grower of acerola for use as juice, in processed food products, and for dietary supplements (93208, 93209).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when acerola fruit is used orally and appropriately. Acerola fruit contains an average of 2000 mg vitamin C per 100 grams of fruit, although this content varies widely. Acerola fruit should be consumed in amounts that do not provide more vitamin C than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg per day for adults (4844).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using in amounts greater than found in foods.",

However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Acerola has been linked with one case of anaphylaxis and one case of rectal obstruction.\nGastrointestinal\nOsmotic diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset have been reported with doses of vitamin C greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg daily (4844). Theoretically this could occur with large doses of oral acerola. A case report describes rectal obstruction with mass consisting of partially digested acerola fruits in a 5-year-old child who had ingested an unknown quantity of fruits daily for 7 days. The child presented with vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, tenesmus, constipation, and dehydration, and required surgical disimpaction (93205).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere is a case report of a 37 year old man who developed a pruritic rash, dyspnea, and tachycardia 5 minutes after drinking a mixture of apple and acerola juices. He had a history of hay fever, oral allergy symptoms with avocado, celery, walnut, and curry, and contact urticaria with latex, but tolerated apples and apple juice. IgE antibodies to acerola were identified in the patient's serum. Ultimately, cross-reactivity between a latex protein and acerola was determined (93206).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nVitamin C deficiency. Orally, consuming acerola might help to prevent or treat vitamin C deficiency since acerola contains a significant amount of vitamin C.\nAcerola is a rich source of vitamin C (30260).

There is concern that antioxidants might reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals, such as alkylating agents (391). In contrast, other researchers theorize that antioxidants might make alkylating chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013).

It is thought that vitamin C chelates aluminum, keeping it in solution and available for absorption (10549, 10550, 10551). In people with normal renal function, urinary excretion of aluminum likely increases, making aluminum retention and toxicity unlikely (10549). However, patients with renal failure who take aluminum-containing compounds, such as phosphate binders, should avoid acerola in doses that provide more vitamin C than the recommended dietary allowances.\nless\nANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, the antioxidant effects of acerola might reduce the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics.\nAcerola contains vitamin C, an antioxidant.

It has been suggested that acidification of the urine by vitamin C can decrease the urinary excretion of salicylates, increasing plasma salicylate levels (3046). However, short-term use of up to 6 grams daily of vitamin C does not seem to affect urinary pH or salicylate excretion (10588, 10589). The vitamin C content of acerola is typically about 2000 mg per 100 grams. Thus, a clinically significant interaction between acerola and aspirin is unlikely.\nless\nESTROGENS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of acerola with estrogens might increase estrogenic effects.\nAcerola contains vitamin C. Increases in plasma estrogen levels of up to 55% have occurred under some circumstances when vitamin C is taken concurrently with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, including topical products (129, 130, 11161). It is suggested that vitamin C prevents oxidation of estrogen in the tissues, regenerates oxidized estrogen, and reduces sulfate conjugation of estrogen in the gut wall (129, 11161). When tissue levels of vitamin C are high, these processes are already maximized and supplemental vitamin C does not have any effect on estrogen levels. However, increases in plasma estrogen levels may occur when women who are deficient in vitamin C take supplements (11161).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, acerola might reduce the effectiveness of warfarin; however, its vitamin C content is likely too low to produce clinically significant effects.\nAcerola contains vitamin C. High doses of vitamin C may reduce the response to warfarin, possibly by causing diarrhea and reducing warfarin absorption (11566). This occurred in two people who took up to 16 grams daily of vitamin C, and resulted in decreased prothrombin time (9804, 9806). Lower doses of 5-10 grams daily of vitamin C can also reduce warfarin absorption, but this does not seem to be clinically significant (9805, 9806, 11566, 11567). The vitamin C content of acerola is typically about 2000 mg per 100 grams. Thus, a clinically significant interaction between acerola and warfarin is unlikely.\nless",

The amount of vitamin C in the diet is a factor in dietary iron absorption and iron status (9570, 9571, 9572). The effect of vitamin C on iron status seems to be greater in individuals with iron deficiency compared to those with sufficient iron levels (21502). Vitamin C can counteract the effects of substances which inhibit iron absorption such as dietary phytates, polyphenols, and tannins, possibly by chemically reducing iron and preventing the formation of less soluble ferric compounds (9518, 9586, 21563).\nless\nROSEHIP\nConcomitant use of acerola and rose hip can increase vitamin C intake.\nAcerola and rose hip both contain vitamin C (12652, 30260).

Vitamin C is metabolized to oxalic acid, so increased consumption of vitamin C increases the urinary concentration of oxalic acid (10356). In people with a history of oxalate kidney stones (the most common type of nephrolithiasis), supplemental vitamin C 1 gram per day appears to increase stone risk by 40% (12653). In men, daily supplemental vitamin C doses as low as 250 mg have been associated with a higher risk of kidney stones (104029). Tell patients prone to kidney stone formation to avoid high doses of acerola.\nless\nLATEX ALLERGY\nTheoretically, acerola might precipitate an allergic reaction in people allergic to latex. There is a case report of a man with a history of latex allergy who developed pruritic rash, dyspnea, and tachycardia after drinking acerola juice.

Vitamin C content ranges from 1000 to 4800 mg, decreasing as the fruit ripens and varying with the time of year (21557, 93207, 93208, 93209). Acerola also contains numerous minerals and other vitamins, including beta-carotene, lutein, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, and pantothenic acid (30260, 93208). Acerola also contains malic acid, glucose, fructose, sucrose, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, astilbin, proanthocyanidin, limonene, and glycosides of cyanidin, pelargonidin, quercetin, and kaempferol (18238, 93207, 93209).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAcerola extracts reduce postprandial glucose levels in animals by reducing uptake and transport of glucose in intestinal cells (93209, 93212). Glycosides of the polyphenols cyanidin, pelargonidin, and quercetin present in acerola also inhibit alpha-glucosidase and production of advanced glycation end products (30262, 93209).\nAntimicrobial effects\nExtracts of acerola fruit have activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and some candida species in vitro (93213).\nAntineoplastic effects\nExtracts of acerola fruit have cytotoxic activity in vitro against human oral squamous cell carcinoma and human submandibular gland carcinoma, and can inhibit transporter molecules which confer multidrug resistance on some cancer cells (93213).\nAntioxidant effects\nAcerola has antioxidant activity in vitro and enhances the effects of other antioxidant compounds such as flavonoids in alfalfa and soy (30256, 93209). Glycosides of cyanidin, pelargonidin, and quercetin present in acerola are reported to have antioxidant effects and to act as free radical scavengers (30262).\nHepatic effects\nAnimal research in mice consuming high-fat diets shows that taking polysaccharides extracted from acerola seems to attenuate fat deposition in the liver, hyperlipidemia, and progression of NAFLD typically caused by high-fat diets (104390)."

A case of mania has been reported for a patient with bipolar I disorder currently in remission. The patient presented with symptoms after taking multiple supplements for the past 4 weeks including acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg twice daily. The symptoms appeared 3 days after beginning to take acetyl-L-carnitine and worsened over the next week. The patient had increased speech rate and volume and reported increased energy levels and racing thoughts. The patient's parent reported irritability and an increase in loud behaviors at home, similar to a previous episode of mania. The patient was advised to discontinue acetyl-L-carnitine, and the manic symptoms disappeared 3 days later (95062).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, acetyl-L-carnitine may cause agitation (restlessness and motor overactivity) (1596, 1599, 12743, 13007). Side effects reported in people with Alzheimer disease include psychiatric disturbances such as depression, mania, confusion and aggression, but it is not clear whether these are due to acetyl-L-carnitine or the condition itself (1594, 1595, 1596, 1597, 1598, 1599, 9105, 10391).\nless\nOther\nOne of the metabolites of acetyl-L-carnitine can cause the urine, breath, and sweat to have a fishy odor (12756).

Oral acetyl-L-carnitine may improve age-related physical and mental fatigue.\nOne clinical trial shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 180 days reduces physical fatigue by 52% and mental fatigue by 43%, compared with only 4% and 8%, respectively, for elderly patients taking placebo. Fatigue after exercise is also reduced by 51% in those taking acetyl-L-carnitine, compared with only 4% in those taking placebo (58375).\nless\nAlcohol use disorder. Intravenous acetyl-L-carnitine may reduce cravings and other symptoms of withdrawal during alcohol detoxification. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial for managing withdrawal or complications of alcohol use disorder.\nClinical research in adults with alcohol use disorder who are in withdrawal shows that acetyl-L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily, administered as a slow intravenous infusion over 3-4 hours for 10 days, followed by 3 grams daily orally for an additional 80 days, improves cravings, the inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia), and melancholic symptoms and increases the time to the first drink when compared with placebo. However, most symptom improvement appears to occur during the first week, so it is unclear if taking acetyl-L-carnitine 3 grams daily orally for an additional 80 days is beneficial (90766, 90767).\n\nOne small clinical trial in adults with chronic alcohol use disorder and cognitive impairment shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 90 days seems to improve memory and visuospatial capacity when compared with placebo (1589).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease and improve some measures of cognitive function.\nClinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1.5-3 grams daily for 3-12 months might slow the rate of Alzheimer disease progression and improve memory, some measures of cognitive function, and behavioral performance. It is more likely to show some effect in those with early-onset Alzheimer disease who are less than 66 years of age and have a faster rate of disease progression and mental decline (1594, 1595, 1596, 1597, 1598, 1599, 9105, 10391). It is unclear how acetyl-L-carnitine compares with prescription medications.\nless\nDepression. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine may reduce symptoms of depression, with comparable effects to conventional antidepressants, in patients with dysthymia and depression. It may be most effective in elderly patients and at higher doses.\nSeveral clinical trials addressing the use of acetyl-L-carnitine in elderly patients with dysthymia and depression have been conducted (3602, 3603, 3604). A meta-analysis of these and other studies, all conducted in Europe, shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1-4 grams daily for 3-24 weeks moderately reduces depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, and appears to have similar effects as conventional antidepressants. Acetyl-L-carnitine seems to be most effective when used at higher dosages. Duration of follow-up and baseline symptoms do not appear to influence results (95065).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine may reduce pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy when taken at doses of at least 2-3 grams daily. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine can improve nerve conduction velocity in these patients.\nAlthough most clinical research evaluating acetyl-L-carnitine for use in diabetic neuropathy has shown benefit, this evidence is of overall low quality. A meta-analysis shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2-3 grams daily for up to 12 months modestly reduces pain scores by about 15 points on a 100-point visual analog scale, while lower doses of 1.5 grams daily improve pain scores to a similar extent as placebo. Some research included in this analysis shows that acetyl-L-carnitine seems to increase nerve fibers, regenerate nerve fiber clusters, and improve vibratory sensations. In two studies, vibration sensation improved after 12 months when compared with placebo, but numerical data are lacking (102126). Other clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg 2-3 times daily decreases pain within 6 months. Acetyl-L-carnitine seems to be most effective for reducing pain in patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Some research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg (Liaoning Haisike Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) three times daily for 24 weeks is as effective as methylcobalamin 0.5 mg three times daily for improving electrophysiological parameters and symptoms as measured by the Neuropathy Disability Score (95067, 102126). However, research on the use of acetyl-L-carnitine to improve nerve conduction velocity in patients with diabetic neuropathy is conflicting (1593, 12743, 12753, 13007, 95067).\nless\nMale infertility. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine, taken in combination with L-carnitine, may increase sperm motility in males with infertility. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine alone can improve sperm function or pregnancy outcomes.\nAlthough some research disagrees (111861), taking acetyl-L-carnitine in combination with L-carnitine, usually in doses of 1 gram and 2 grams, respectively, daily for 3-6 months seems to increase sperm motility in males with infertility of various etiologies. The evidence related to the effect of this combination on sperm count and morphology is mixed (12352, 58182, 58194, 58469, 101560, 107394, 111459, 111890). However, it is unclear if taking L-carnitine increases the odds of pregnancy. One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking these carnitines in combination increases the odds of pregnancy by 3.7-fold over placebo. However most clinical research investigating the effect of L-carnitine alone or with acetyl L-carnitine on pregnancy rates disagrees (12352, 58182, 101560, 111861, 111459). Taking acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg and L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily after taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 2 months seems to increase sperm count and motility in those with abacterial prostatovesiculoepididymitis, an inflammation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymis (9791).\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One study shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 50 mg in combination with L-carnitine 150 mg, L-arginine 1660 mg, and Panax ginseng 200 mg daily for 3 months increases sperm motility and sexual satisfaction in those with asthenospermia when compared with no treatment (32189). Another small clinical trial shows that taking this combination along with prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 6 months improves sperm concentration and motility when compared with treatment with prulifloxacin alone in patients with chronic prostatitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection (59006). Other small and preliminary Iclinical studies have investigated the effects of a specific combination product providing acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg twice daily for 6 months, along with L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, folic acid, vitamin B12, and citric acid (Proxeed Plus). Taking this combination product has been shown to improve measures of sperm quality such as sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility when compared to baseline. The effect on sperm volume and morphology is unclear. Most research has been conducted in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia, although some benefit has also been shown in patients with varicocele-related infertility, especially those with more severe varicocele (102017, 107395, 111296). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The evidence related to the effect of oral acetyl-L-carnitine on symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is mixed. Some research shows that it may actually worsen symptoms.\nHigh quality clinical research in females treated with taxane-based therapy for early-stage breast cancer shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg three times daily for 24 weeks does not improve symptoms of neuropathy when compared with placebo. In fact, acetyl-L-carnitine treatment may actually make symptoms worse in some patients, with worsened symptoms persisting for up to at least 2 years (90758, 96938, 111882). Also, a small clinical trial in patients with multiple myeloma receiving bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1.5 grams daily does not reduce symptoms of peripheral neuropathy when compared with not taking acetyl-L-carnitine (90756). A small clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving sagopilone shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg every three days appears to reduce the more severe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy; however, the overall incidence or duration of peripheral neuropathy is not reduced when compared with placebo (90757). Some research disagrees. One clinical trial in patients with taxoid-related neuropathy shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine3 grams daily for 8 weeks modestly improves the severity of neuropathy by at last one grade in 51% of patients compared with 24% of those taking placebo. Functional improvement was also modestly improved (111862). Based on the available research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology strongly discourages the use of acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, noting that the harms outweigh the potential benefits (104168).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in older males shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams, in combination with propionyl-L-carnitine 2 grams, daily for 6 months seems to attenuate symptoms of androgen decline. The combination appears to be similar to testosterone for improving sexual dysfunction, depression, and fatigue (12353). It is unclear if these findings are due to acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, or the combination.\nless\nAging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nAmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with ALS.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with ALS shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg three times daily for 48 weeks, along with riluzole 50 mg twice daily, reduces the number of patients who lose self-sufficiency by about 17%, increases patient survival by a median of 23 months, and improves some measures of physical function when compared with riluzole alone (90755).\nless\nAntiretroviral toxic neuropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral acetyl-L-carnitine may modestly improve symptoms in patients with antiretroviral toxic neuropathy. It is unclear if intramuscular or intravenous acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nSmall clinical trials show that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000-1500 mg twice daily for up to 33 months might relieve symptoms of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy caused by antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive patients (12745, 58342). Also, a small, uncontrolled clinical study shows that intramuscular or intravenous administration of acetyl-L-carnitine 500-1000 mg daily for 3 weeks reduces pain intensity when compared to baseline in some HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (12747). However, another clinical study shows that intramuscular acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg twice daily for 14 days does not reduce pain when compared with placebo (58342).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA retrospective review of adults with fatigue who were found to have vascular stiffness beyond that expected for their age suggests that taking a combination of acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily, gamma-linolenic acid 40 mg twice daily, and grape extract 150 mg twice daily for at least 1 year is associated with a reduction in arterial stiffness, as well as blood pressure measurements in all four limbs, when compared to baseline (113941). It is unclear if these findings are related to acetyl-L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by a high attrition rate and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAthletic performance. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Small clinical trials suggest that oral acetyl-L-carnitine is not beneficial in children with ADHD.\nOne small clinical trial in children and adolescents with ADHD shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily, based on body weight, in two divided doses along with methylphenidate 20-30 mg daily for 3 weeks does not reduce symptoms of ADHD when compared with methylphenidate alone (90754). Based on this and another small trial, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that acetyl-L-carnitine in doses of 1-3 grams daily is not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use for ADHD in children (110318).\nless\nBell palsy. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for Bell palsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nBipolar disorder. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg plus alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg up to three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression when compared with placebo (90441).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for cancer-related fatigue, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients undergoing surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 3000 mg daily for 2 months postoperatively does not improve nerve regeneration or functional recovery when compared with placebo (100349). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients. In patients with mild to moderate symptoms awaiting carpal tunnel release, preliminary clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine as part of a multi-ingredient formulation for 60 days reduces pain by 31%, but does not improve function, when compared with no treatment. The formulation provided a total of 600 mg twice daily of acetyl-L-carnitine with alpha-lipoic acid, phosphatidylserine, curcumin, thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamins C, E, B6, and B12 (111702).\nless\nCataracts. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CFS.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with CFS shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months improves general fatigue in up to 59% of patients when compared with baseline. The combination of acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine appears to be less effective than either supplement alone, with only 37% of patients taking this combination achieving improvement when compared with baseline (11788).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine improves glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.\nClinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 6 months does not improve blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin levels, insulin resistance, or glucose disposal rate when compared with placebo. Most patients were already taking one or more antidiabetes drug, as well as medication for hypertension and dyslipidemia (96937). It is unclear if acetyl-L-carnitine improves glycemic profile in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.\nless\nDown syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for Down syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine reduces lipid levels in adults with dyslipidemia.\nClinical research in patients with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 6 months does not improve cholesterol, triglycerides, or lipoprotein(a) levels when compared with placebo. All patients were taking statins prior to treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine, and most were receiving medication for hypertension and diabetes (96937). It is unclear if acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients not taking statins.\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral and/or intramuscular acetyl-L-carnitine can improve symptoms of fibromyalgia.\nOne clinical study in patients with fibromyalgia shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg daily orally plus acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg daily intramuscularly for 2 weeks, followed by acetyl-L-carnitine 1500 mg daily orally for 8 weeks, reduces muscle pain and improves mood, general health, and quality of life when compared with placebo (90768). A smaller clinical study in patients with fibromyalgia shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks improves quality of life (physical) scores and symptoms of depression, but not pain, anxiety, or quality of life (mental) scores when compared with baseline (90761). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) 600 mg twice daily for 12 weeks increases the proportion of patients with at least a 30% reduction in pain by 86% when compared with not taking this combination. There was also a modest improvement in the overall assessment of status. All patients were on stable treatment with duloxetine and pregabalin for 3 months prior to the initiation of acetyl-L-carnitine and PEA, and this treatment continued throughout the study (111901).\nless\nFragile X syndrome. Small clinical studies suggest that oral acetyl-L-carnitine is not beneficial in children with fragile X syndrome.\nTwo small clinical studies in children with fragile X syndrome shows that acetyl-L-carnitine 20-50 mg/kg daily for one year does not improve intellectual function when compared with placebo. Also, while it may reduce hyperactive behavior in these patients based on parent assessment, it does not appear to reduce hyperactive behavior based on teacher assessment (9956, 93063).\nless\nFrailty. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine prevents frailty.\nClinical research in pre-frail older adults shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1.5 grams twice daily for 3 months modestly improves cognition and the distance walked in 6 minutes when compared with taking placebo (111889). It is unclear whether taking acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial for frailty treatment or prevention.\nless\nHepatic encephalopathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral acetyl-L-carnitine may not improve quality of life or fatigue in patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis.\nThe benefits of acetyl-L-carnitine in the management of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis are unclear (58922, 58949, 59002, 90759). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 90 days does not improve quality of life or fatigue in this population when compared with placebo. However, major clinical outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, days of hospitalization, and serious adverse events, have not been evaluated. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the small size, high risk for bias, and heterogeneity of the included studies (100350).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine lowers blood pressure in adults with hypertension.\nClinical research in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 6 months does not improve systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. Most patients were already being treated with antihypertensive drugs prior to treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine, in addition to medications for dyslipidemia and diabetes (96937). It is unclear if acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\nless\nInfertility. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for infertility in females, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue.\nOne small clinical study in patients with multiple sclerosis shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for one month reduces fatigue by approximately 25% when compared with placebo (90760).\nless\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nPeripheral neuropathy. Although there has been interest in using oral acetyl-L-carnitine for peripheral neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of acetyl-L-carnitine for this purpose.\nPeyronie disease. A small clinical study suggests that oral acetyl-L-carnitine may modestly improve symptoms of Peyronie disease.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with acute and early chronic Peyronie disease shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 3 months reduces pain and slows disease progression when compared with tamoxifen 20 mg twice daily (10076).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with PCOS.\nA clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1.5 grams, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, twice daily for 12 weeks improves menstrual irregularity and insulin resistance when compared with baseline. The lack of statistical comparison to placebo, as well as the combined use with metformin and pioglitazone, limits the validity of these findings (107396).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nA very small, open-label clinical study in patients with schizophrenia who partially responded to clozapine therapy shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram daily, in combination with clozapine 300-600 mg daily, for 12 weeks reduces positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but not cognitive function or other clinical symptoms, when compared with baseline (95063). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSciatica. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with sciatica.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disc shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine (Nicetile, SigmaTau Ind. Farm. Riunite SpA,) 1180 mg daily for 60 days decreases the use of analgesics when compared with baseline. However, acetyl-L-carnitine appears to be less effective than alpha-lipoic acid (Byodiniral 300 QR, MDM SpA,) 600 mg daily for reducing lower limb pain and the use of analgesics (21671).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral acetyl-L-carnitine is beneficial following a stroke.\nClinical research in patients with an acute ischemic stroke given routine care shows that oral or nasogastric acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram three times daily for 3 days modestly improves stroke impairment and overall function 3 months after the stroke when compared with taking placebo. The proportion of patients taking acetyl-L-carnitine with no symptoms or obvious disability at 3 months was 53%, compared with 29% of patients taking placebo. The patients in this study were not candidates of reperfusion therapy and initiated acetyl-L-carnitine within 24 hours of the stroke (111894).\nless\nToxin-induced liver damage. Oral acetyl-L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 250 mg, along with coenzyme Q10 and alpha-lipoic acid, twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the risk of drug-induced liver injury by 73% when compared with placebo (107445). It is unclear if these findings are due to acetyl-L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate acetyl-L-carnitine for these uses.",

There are at least two case reports of INR elevation when L-carnitine was taken with acenocoumarol. In one case, a 33-year-old male with a previously stable INR had an elevated INR of 4.65 after L-carnitine was started and continued for 10 weeks.

Pivalate combines with carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (12759). Theoretically, losses of acetyl-L-carnitine could also be increased. Adefovir was formerly used for HIV infection at doses of 125-500 mg daily and was associated with significant dose- and duration-related decreases in blood carnitine. After 12 weeks of therapy with 125-250 mg daily, decreases of 42% to 62% were seen (15502), while 500 mg daily was associated with a 66% decrease in L-carnitine after 2 weeks (15503). Some studies used a supplement of L-carnitine 500 mg daily during adefovir therapy (15501, 15504). Adefovir is now used at a lower dose of 10 mg daily for treatment of hepatitis B.

Some studies have found reduced levels in some patients on the drug (1911, 4528, 12758), while others have found no effect (1913, 4526, 15505). Routine L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary. Preliminary data in patients treated with the related drug oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) suggest that it does not affect levels of carnitines (15505).\nless\nCEFDITOREN PIVOXIL (Spectracef)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTheoretically, acetyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking cefditoren pivoxil.\nCefditoren pivoxil is a prodrug which is converted to cefditoren and pivalate in the body. Pivalate combines with L-carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (12759). Theoretically, losses of acetyl-L-carnitine could also be increased. Short courses of cefditoren can decrease blood concentrations of L-carnitine, but tissue levels are unlikely to be affected. Treatment for 1-2 months may cause a decrease in muscle L-carnitine, and treatment for 6 months or longer may cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency (12759). Routine L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary unless therapy is prolonged or the patient has other factors contributing to low L-carnitine stores.\nless\nCISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, acetyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking cisplatin.\nIncreased urinary losses of L-carnitine can occur during cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin might increase L-carnitine mobilization due to tissue injury and reduce renal tubular reabsorption due to kidney injury. Theoretically, cisplatin may also increase losses of acetyl-L-carnitine. Deficiency of carnitines is unlikely in people who can maintain adequate dietary intake (3642).\nless\nIFOSFAMIDE (Ifex)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, acetyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking ifosfamide.\nIncreased urinary losses of L-carnitine can occur during ifosfamide therapy (3641). This might be due to binding of L-carnitine with a metabolite of ifosfamide (3641, 11558). Theoretically, ifosfamide may also increase losses of acetyl-L-carnitine. The clinical significance of this and the role of carnitine supplements in people treated with ifosfamide are unknown.\nless\nISOTRETINOIN (Accutane)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, acetyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking isotretinoin.\nData on the effects of isotretinoin on carnitine levels are conflicting. Reduced carnitine blood levels have been reported with the use of isotretinoin, sometimes with symptoms of carnitine deficiency, such as myalgia and muscle stiffness (3619).

Valproic acid interferes with L-carnitine biosynthesis in the liver and forms a valproylcarnitine ester, which is excreted in the urine, reducing tubular reabsorption of free carnitine (4528, 4529, 5798, 15508). Reduced L-carnitine levels are not clinically significant in most people taking valproic acid. However, some patients may be at increased risk for L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid, and this may contribute to the development of hyperammonemia and hepatotoxicity associated with the drug (1916, 1917, 5798). Risk factors for symptomatic L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid include age less than 2 years, severe neurological problems including mental retardation, taking multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor nutrition, and use of the ketogenic diet (4528, 5798, 9612). Some experts recommend L-carnitine supplements for people with these risk factors who need to take valproic acid (4523, 4526, 4528, 4529, 5798). There is one case report of successful use of acetyl-L-carnitine in a patient with asymptomatic hyperammonemia secondary to valproate (95064). However, carnitine supplements aren't necessary for most people taking valproic acid who are otherwise healthy and consuming a diet adequate in L-carnitine (9612, 15507).\nless\nZIDOVUDINE (Retrovir)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, acetyl-L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking zidovudine.\nLow L-carnitine blood levels are found in some people with HIV infection. Zidovudine seems to exacerbate this, and can also lower muscle carnitine levels, which is linked to symptoms of myopathy (3617, 3618, 11551). Zidovudine interferes with mitochondrial transport of L-carnitine into muscle cells (3617, 9885). In vitro data suggest L-carnitine supplements might improve functioning of muscle cells affected by zidovudine (3617, 9885), but there is not enough data to recommend routine use of L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine supplements for patients taking zidovudine.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with acetyl-L-carnitine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTaking acetyl-L-carnitine increases plasma levels of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines (58922, 58949, 59002, 111894). The bioavailability of acetyl-L-carnitine is higher when given intravenously versus orally (90766).\n\nA study in healthy male volunteers compared a one-time dose of two commercially available acetyl-L-carnitine products for bioequivalence. Both products were formulated as 590 mg acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride, containing 500 mg acetyl-L-carnitine. The maximum plasma concentration of both products was about 1.7 mcg/mL. Plasma levels returned to baseline roughly 4 hours post dose. The estimated bioavailability of the products was approximately 20% (95061).\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of acetyl-L-carnitine, plasma levels reportedly return to baseline after 4-48 hours (95061).\nExcretion\nThe kidney aids in keeping carnitine levels stable. Normally, greater than 90% of filtered carnitine is reabsorbed. If dietary intake of carnitines decreases, carnitine reabsorption becomes even more efficient (12744, 95061).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAcetyl-L-carnitine occurs naturally in the body. Endogenous carnitines exist as a \"carnitine pool\" consisting of L-carnitine and several acetyl-carnitine esters. Intracellular enzymes and cell membrane transporters can rapidly interconvert the carnitines to the needed form and transport them between the tissues and extracellular space. Acetyl-L-carnitine, the most important carnitine ester, is converted to L-carnitine in the body by carnitine acetyltransferase (10395, 12744). The body obtains some carnitine from the diet, primarily from red meats and dairy products. The body can also synthesize carnitines from the amino acids, lysine and methionine. The kidney aids in keeping carnitine levels stable (12744). Carnitines play an important role in lipid metabolism and energy production. They are essential for normal mitochondrial function, acting as a transporter of long-chain fatty acids and acetyl CoA into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production (12745, 12748, 12756, 13007, 95062, 95063). Acetyl-L-carnitine also binds organic acids and fragmented free fatty acids and removes them from cells, preventing cell damage (102126). Carnitine deficiency from inborn disorders of carnitine metabolism most often presents with symptoms of progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness, and less frequently with fasting hypoglycemic coma (12748).\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine stimulates membrane phospholipids synthesis, which leads to stabilization of cell membranes. This in turn suggests it may act as a neuromodulatory agent (95062, 95063). It is also involved in numerous other functions such as protein and gene expression. It also plays a role in the production of nerve growth factor (95062, 95063). It also has an effect on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. This may be a direct effect or via activation of cholinergic receptors (95063).\nAlzheimer disease effects\nAcetyl-L-carnitine is structurally related to acetylcholine. It also serves as a precursor to acetyl coenzyme A and contributes acetyl groups to acetylcholine (10395, 95063). Acetyl-L-carnitine also seems to promote acetylcholine release and increases choline acetyltransferase activity (44). These effects have led to the study of acetyl-L-carnitine in Alzheimer disease, in which there is substantial cholinergic neuronal loss and acetylcholine depletion (1594). It may also lessen oxidative stress and prevent oxidative damage in the brain better than L-carnitine (12688).\nAnti-HIV effects\nIn HIV patients, acetyl-L-carnitine might slow the loss of CD4 lymphocytes by reducing apoptosis and increasing the serum level of insulin-like growth factor 1, which protects against apoptosis (3605). However, it doesn't seem to affect viral load or CD4 or CD8 cell counts (12745).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of acetyl-L-carnitine are thought to play a role in the potential improvement of its post-stroke functional and neurological outcomes. In human research, acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to reduce levels of inflammatory markers, including interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (111894).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCarnitine levels are lower in people with complications of diabetes (12746). Preliminary clinical research shows that acetyl-L-carnitine might improve glucose utilization, possibly by increasing expression of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes (12754).\nAntineuropathy effects\nCarnitine levels are lower in people with complications of diabetes (12746). In diabetic neuropathy, there is damage to sensory neuronal membranes. This causes an increase in sodium channels, which increases spontaneous neuronal firing. Acetyl-L-carnitine is thought to slow neuronal degeneration or help in the regeneration and repair of neurons and therefore decrease excessive excitability and firing. These effects combined with its effects on fatty acids may also improve energy production in nerves. It also appears to improve membrane stability and synthesis of prostacyclin. Its improvements on utilization of fatty acids may help to reduce insulin resistance, although it does not appear to have an effect on glucose levels. Acetyl-L-carnitine might improve peripheral as well as autonomic neuropathy (12749, 12750, 12751, 12752, 13007, 58342, 95067).\n\nLower plasma levels of acetyl-L-carnitine are also associated with neuropathy in people who take HIV drugs (3606). Preliminary research suggests it might increase the activity of nerve growth factor and promote peripheral nerve regeneration. It might also have analgesic properties (12745, 58342, 95067).\n\nPreliminary research suggests acetyl-L-carnitine might also prevent cisplatin (Platinol) and paclitaxel (Taxol)-induced neuropathy (12755).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of acetyl-L-carnitine are thought to play a role in the potential improvement of its post-stroke functional and neurological outcomes. In human research, acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to increase serum levels of antioxidant biomarkers (111894).\nFertility effects\nAcetyl-L-carnitine and L-carnitine are present in human sperm and seminal fluid (3607). Their levels increase in sperm during the maturation process in the epididymis and coincide with the acquisition of progressive motility (3608, 3609). Levels of acetyl-L-carnitine, and the ratio of acetyl-L-carnitine to L-carnitine, have been reported to be lower in infertile semen and sperm samples with low motility (3610, 3611). An increase in sperm motility is seen in vitro when acetyl-L-carnitine or L-carnitine is added to the sample (3612). Preliminary research also suggests acetyl-L-carnitine may increase testosterone production and improve testicular function (12686, 12687).\nHepatic effects\nIn patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, serum levels of L-carnitine and its esters are sometimes increased, possibly due to increased L-carnitine biosynthesis (1931, 1948). In humans with hepatitis, alcohol use disorder, or cirrhosis leading to hepatic encephalopathy, acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to improve levels of liver enzymes, ammonia, prothrombin, urea, and/or bilirubin (58922, 58949, 59002).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using acetyl-L-carnitine to improve blood flow in patients with a history of ischemic stroke. Some clinical research shows that administering a single intravenous dose of acetyl-L-carnitine 1500 mg produces short-term improvements in cerebral blood flow in the ischemic region of the brain in adults with chronic cerebral ischemia (1591, 1592).\nPsychiatric effects\nIn animals, acetyl-L-carnitine may increase the release of dopamine. This could lead to symptoms of mania, especially in those with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, since bipolar disorder may lead to reduced reuptake of dopamine, leading to further increased levels of dopamine in these patients (95062).\n\nIn schizophrenia, mitochondrial dysfunction is present. It is thought this may be associated with the deficit of dendritic spines seen in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Theoretically, supplementing with acetyl-L-carnitine may ameliorate the dysfunction, given its positive effects on the mitochondria. In animals, acetyl-L-carnitine has shown benefits with respect to correcting dendritic spine morphology and density, but only when given prior to the insult or at birth. Thus, acetyl-L-carnitine may be a treatment better suited to use before onset of symptoms and functional changes in patients with schizophrenia (95063).\n\nIn depression, it is speculated that alterations in the metabolism of fatty acids is present. Carnitine appears to modulate neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters as well as the activity of cell membranes and lipid metabolism. As such, there is interest in using carnitine for treating depression, however, acetyl-L-carnitine more freely crosses the blood brain barrier than carnitine, and is sometimes used in clinical research instead of carnitine (95065). Acetyl-L-carnitine may have neuroplasticity effects in some regions of the brain (95065, 95066). It can increase the release of glutamate and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It can also up-regulate mGLU2 receptors, which are receptors for glutamate. In animals, acetyl-L-carnitine lead to increases in myo-inositol, which may improve depression since lower levels of myo-inositol appear to play a role in the development of depression. Acetyl-L-carnitine is also involved in the modulation of neurotransmitters and may increase levels of serotonin and dopamine. It may also play a role in reduction in pain, which could improve depression in certain patient populations (95065).\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine may help to normalize the phosphomonoester levels in the brain, helping to treat depression in the geriatric population (95065, 95066)\nWeight loss effects\nAn individual clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine has no effect on body mass index when compared with placebo (107393).\nWithdrawal effects\nAcetyl-L-carnitine may reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It is thought that dopaminergic agents and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission antagonists may be important for aiding in alcohol withdrawal. L-carnitine has been shown to increase levels of dopamine in specific parts of the brain of animal models and acetyl-L-carnitine increases dopamine outflow. Acetyl-L-carnitine may also modulate NMDA receptors. In humans, acetyl-L-carnitine increases levels of beta-endorphins, which may also ease withdrawal from alcohol (90766, 90767)."

This combination injection may also modestly reduce disease severity and the risk of mortality when compared with standard treatment.

In Chinese medicine, the rootstocks are cured by soaking in water, with frequent changes to fresh water, and then boiling or steaming for prolonged periods of time. This process hydrolyzes the aconite alkaloids into less toxic derivatives, but toxicities and fatalities have occurred even after ingestion of these cured and processed aconite roots (2634, 3490). In Ayurvedic medicine, aconite toxicity is reduced using a method called shodhana. This involves soaking the aconite root in different liquids, including cow urine, cow milk, or goat milk (92279).",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAconite contains toxic alkaloids that can cause serious adverse effects. Reported adverse effects after oral or topical exposure include nausea, vomiting, pupil dilation, weakness, sweating, restlessness, dizziness, paresthesia, seizures, hypotension, palpitations, hypokalemia, acidosis, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, bradycardia, tachycardia, sustained or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de pointes, reduced consciousness, and death (558, 559, 561, 562, 563, 3490, 3491, 15499, 15650, 30294)(30295, 30300, 30305, 30319, 30323, 30335, 30336, 30341, 92276, 104513)(106706, 110473, 112901, 112902).\n\nThe first symptoms of aconite oral intoxication usually begin within 10-90 minutes after ingestion, although toxicity may be delayed until a second or third dose (559, 15499, 110473, 112901). Aconite contamination of other herbal products has also caused severe adverse effects and poisoning. In some cases, aconite was not listed on the label, but was detected by analysis of the product and patient's urine. Neurological and cardiovascular adverse events occurred in up to 94% of these cases (92277).\nTreatment\nThere is no known antidote for aconite toxicity (106706). Treatment of aconite toxicity is typically supportive, although charcoal hemoperfusion has aided in detoxification (15499, 106706). Cardioversion has been reported to be ineffective for the reversal of aconite-induced dysrhythmia, but the use of agents such as amiodarone, lidocaine, and magnesium have been successful in some cases (2634, 3490, 106706, 112901). One case reports successful ventricular arrhythmia and electrical storm suppression after administering a short-acting, beta 1-superselective intravenous adrenergic antagonist (i.e. landiolol) in an amiodarone-refractory ventricular arrhythmia due to aconite poisoning(112902).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal research, the constituent aconitine is absorbed in the esophagus and stomach (3491).\nDistribution\nPost-mortem examinations have found aconite alkaloids in the liver, kidney, heart, and cerebrum (92278).\nMetabolism\nAconite alkaloids are primarily excreted unchanged, but there may be a minor pathway involving cytochrome P450 3A4 (104513, 104515).\nExcretion\nAconite alkaloids are primarily eliminated in the urine with first-order kinetics (104513). Excretion occurs for up to 7 days after administration. The half-life of aconitine is about 3 hours (104514, 106706). Other aconite alkaloids have half-lives of 15 hours or more (30315, 30344, 92277, 92278).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of aconite is the root. Aconite contains alkaloids including aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, isoaconitine (yunaconitine), jesaconitine, crassicauline A, and higenamine which have widespread effects on cardiac, neuronal, and smooth muscle tissue by activating voltage gated sodium channels, leading to persistent cellular activity and cellular sodium overload (559, 3490, 92277, 92282, 104513). Aconitine appears to be the most toxic constituent (30326). The total content of aconitine and other toxic alkaloids can be reduced by as much as 90% by soaking aconite root in an alkaline solution and boiling (15499). Levels of toxic alkaloids are also affected by time of harvest and the method of processing (15650).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that aconite and its constituents, aconitine and mesaconitine, have analgesic effects. In animal research, processed aconite root and its constituent neoline reduced pain associated with neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin. In laboratory research, aconite extract and neoline appeared to protect against a reduction of neuron elongation by oxaliplatin (92280). The analgesic activity of some aconite constituents might be mediated by central noradrenergic pathways (30318).\nAntiplatelet effects\nAconite is traditionally used to improve hemodynamics. Laboratory research suggests that the aconite constituent higenamine inhibits platelet aggregation and has anti-thrombosis effects in animal thrombosis models. The mechanisms of action may be related to activity at alpha-adrenergic receptors, and thromboxane inhibition (92282).\nAntipyretic effects\nAconite is traditionally used to treat fever. In animal research, the constituents mesaconitine and ignavine demonstrated hypothermic effects (30330).\nBlood pressure effects\nAconite is thought to both increase and decrease blood pressure depending on levels of specific active constituents. Levels of constituents are dependent on dose, plant origins, processing methods, and time following dose. In animal research, differential effects of aconite on blood pressure have been recorded, possibly due to excitement of both alpha and beta-2 receptors in blood vessels. Aconite might also affect blood vessel dilation by an endothelium-dependent mechanism (30296, 92282).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary research suggests that multiple constituents of aconite have cardiotonic effects. In the cardiac muscle, aconite appears to activate sodium channels leading to tachyarrhythmias. Constituents may also stimulate the vagus nerve (2634, 15499, 92282). In animal and human models of bradycardia, higenamine increases heart rate (18020, 95552). In mice, aconitine induces bradycardia, possibly via the anterior hypothalamus (30343), and tachycardia using a mechanism mediated by central beta-adrenergic receptors. The hypertensive effects of aconitine are theorized to be mediated by central stimulation that results in peripheral vasodilation. The constituent hypaconitine might also have negative inotropic effects on the heart (15499, 30296).\n\nConversely, aconite might have beneficial cardiovascular effects. In an animal heart failure model, aconite decoction and constituents such as hypaconitine and higenamine protected blood vessels and myocardial cells, improving heart function. Protection of myocardial cells may be due to reduction of apoptosis-promoting proteins and promotion of stem cell mobilization and cell proliferation. In a cardiac hypertrophy model, aconite appears to protect the heart by inhibiting collagen synthesis. An animal model suggests that aconite administered daily for 5 days before and 2 days after inducing myocardial infarction may improve infarct area size, left ventricular heart strain, and heart function when compared with control (112903). Some of the cardioprotective effects of aconite may be related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the constituents (112903). Differential effects of aconite on the heart may be related to dose, plant origins, processing methods, and specific animal models (30331, 92282).\nLiver enzyme effects\nAn ethanol extract of the root of Aconitum carmichaelii is reported to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 enzymes in rats (104512). Whether these effects occur in humans at clinically relevant aconite concentrations is not known. Preliminary research also suggests that increasing liver CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity in rats by pretreating with licorice increases the conversion of aconitine to less toxic metabolites and lowers its plasma levels (104515). This suggests that aconitine may be a CYP3A4 and/or P-gp substrate.\nVascular effects\nClinical research suggests that aconitine, a constituent of aconite, might increase nitric oxide levels, which might improve peripheral circulation and reduce feelings of coldness (15500). Aconite might affect blood vessel dilation by an endothelium-dependent mechanism (92282)."

It has been used medicinally for thousands of years, and for gastrointestinal decontamination for over 100 years (12396, 93613). Charcoal is activated by increasing the number of pores, thus increasing the surface area. This is achieved by heating to a high temperature in the presence of steam or carbon dioxide, or with an activating agent such as phosphoric acid or zinc chloride (12392). In foods, activated charcoal is sometimes used as a black food coloring.",

Constipation appears to be the most frequent complaint, but is typically transient. Black stools, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence have also been reported (12392, 12398, 93611, 103193). Rarely, activated charcoal may lead to gastrointestinal obstruction (12392).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nRarely, pulmonary aspiration has been reported in patients taking activated charcoal orally. This may happen if activated charcoal is regurgitated or if a misplaced nasogastric tube delivers activated charcoal to the lungs rather than the stomach (12392).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nPoisoning. Oral activated charcoal taken after ingestion of certain drugs reduces systemic drug exposure. However, it is unclear if it affects clinical endpoints such as morbidity or mortality.\nTaking activated charcoal orally appears to be effective when used as part of standard treatment for some, but not all, acute poisonings (12392, 12393, 93198, 93606, 93607, 93613, 94730). Single doses of activated charcoal, 25-100 grams in adults (10-50 grams in children, depending on age), are effective for preventing absorption of some drugs, including acetaminophen, aminophylline, amiodarone, aspirin, atenolol, carbamazepine, digoxin, fluoxetine, indomethacin, phenytoin, valproate, and verapamil, especially if taken within one hour of ingestion (93602, 93610, 93612, 93613, 94730, 108852). A single dose reduces drug exposure by 38% to 52% when given within 1 hour, by 21% to 35% when given 2-4 hours after ingestion, and by about 14% when given 6 hours after ingestion. These late effects, occurring after oral absorption is complete, are due to enhanced elimination via interruption of enterohepatic circulation and binding of drug that has been actively or passively transported back into the gastrointestinal tract (105543).\n\nMultiple-dose activated charcoal, 50-100 grams initially followed by doses of 25 grams every 2 hours or 50 grams every 4 hours, or 10-25 grams per dose in children, is recommended for patients who ingest life-threatening amounts of carbamazepine, dapsone, phenobarbital, quinine, or theophylline. This is based on clinical, animal, and in vitro research showing increased elimination of these drugs (12392, 105543). This increased elimination can also reduce levels of drugs that have been given intravenously, with the median half-life being decreased by an average of 45% and the median area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) by an average of 47% (105543). Additional research suggests that multiple-dose activated charcoal may be useful for increasing the elimination of amitriptyline, digoxin, imipramine, moxifloxacin, nadolol, phenytoin, piroxicam, and sotalol. Evidence supporting the use of multiple-dose activated charcoal in aspirin, doxepin, tobramycin, valproate, or vancomycin overdose is limited or conflicting (12392, 105543).\n\nWhile activated charcoal may reduce absorption of some toxic agents, there is contradictory evidence about whether it improves clinical outcomes (12392, 93200, 93601, 93613, 94730). Administering activated charcoal 50 grams every 6 hours for carbamazepine poisoning decreases the duration of coma by 9 hours, the duration of mechanical ventilation by 12 hours, and the length of hospital stay by 9 hours. However, activated charcoal does not reduce the duration of hospitalization, intensive care admission, vomiting, or mortality when compared with control after oral overdose of benzodiazepines, acetaminophen, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (93200). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with phenytoin toxicity shows that taking activated charcoal 50 grams orally every 4 hours reduces the time to return to therapeutic levels by about 22 hours when compared with control, but without reducing symptoms (93609). In patients with pesticide or yellow oleander seed toxicity, neither single-dose nor multi-dose regimens of activated charcoal reduce mortality, seizures, or the need for intubation when compared with control (93601).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCeliac disease. Although there is interest in using activated charcoal for acute gluten exposure in those with celiac disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of activated charcoal for this purpose.\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in children treated with irinotecan shows that taking activated charcoal 250 mg the night before the first infusion and every 8 hours thereafter until the end of the cycle reduces the risk of diarrhea by 60% when compared with no treatment. Activated charcoal also appears to reduce the risk of severe diarrhea by 92% and to decrease chemotherapy discontinuation by 87% in these patients (93608).\nless\nCholestasis. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with pregnancy-induced cholestasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in pregnant patients with cholestasis shows that taking activated charcoal 50 grams orally three times daily for 8 days decreases bile acid levels by about 50%, compared with an increase in those not taking activated charcoal. However, itching was not significantly improved with activated charcoal when compared with control (126).\nless\nConstipation. Oral activated charcoal has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with chronic constipation shows that a specific combination product (Nucarb; Wilshire Laboratories Ltd) containing activated charcoal 180 mg, calcium sennosides 50 mg, peppermint oil 0.5 mg, fennel oil 0.5 mg, rhubarb extract 250 mg, and sulfur 50 mg, taken as two tablets at bedtime for one week, followed by 1 tablet at bedtime for 1 week, reduces passing gas, abdominal pain, and sensation of bloating by 81%, 73%, and 72% respectively, when compared with baseline. Sensation of straining, severity of constipation, and feeling of incomplete evacuation were reduced by 69%, 67%, and 54% respectively, when compared with baseline (108853). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral activated charcoal has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with functional dyspepsia shows that taking a specific combination product containing activated charcoal 280 mg, simethicone 90 mg, and magnesium oxide 180 mg (Carbosymag, Laboratoires Grimberg) three times daily for one month reduces symptoms of dyspepsia, such as postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and abdominal bloating, when compared with placebo (93199). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with dyspepsia shows that taking another specific combination product containing activated charcoal 280 mg and simethicone 90 mg (Carbosylane, Laboratoires Grimberg) three times daily for 3 months does not improve overall symptoms of dyspepsia or nausea, but does improve abdominal fullness by 20%, bloating by 20%, and slow digestion by 30%, when compared with placebo (93604).\nless\nFlatulence. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial for reducing the occurrence of flatulence.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal (Requa Charcocaps) 582 mg after a gas-producing meal significantly decreases the number of flatus events when compared with placebo. On average, subjects taking activated charcoal reported less than 3 flatus events over 8 hours, compared with more than 14 flatus events in those taking placebo (12395). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal 520 mg at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime for 7 days does not significantly reduce excessive gas or total flatus events when compared with baseline (12396).\nless\nHangover. There is no reliable evidence that activated charcoal prevents or treats hangover.\nActivated charcoal is included in some hangover remedies. However, ethanol adsorbs poorly to activated charcoal (12400).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nSome preliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking activated charcoal 4-32 grams daily for 3 weeks decreases total cholesterol by up to 29% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by up to 41% when compared with control. The effects of activated charcoal appear to be dose-dependent. Additional clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal 20 grams twice daily for 3 weeks is as effective as cholestyramine 8 grams twice daily for treating hypercholesterolemia (12398), but the combined use of activated charcoal and cholestyramine does not appear to confer additional benefit when compared with either agent alone (12397). However, other research suggests that activated charcoal is not effective for treating hypercholesterolemia (12399). Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may relate to the small size of the latter study, and the inclusion of some patients without hyperlipidemia.\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. Oral activated charcoal might reduce the incidence of hyperphosphatemia in patients with kidney disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) shows that taking activated charcoal 0.6-1.2 grams three times daily for 12 months reduces the risk of hyperphosphatemia by 64% when compared with placebo. Additionally, in CKD patients who develop hyperphosphatemia, use of activated charcoal at the same dose for up to 24 months seems to delay the development of vascular calcification when compared with calcium carbonate, but not when compared with lanthanum carbonate (103193). Other preliminary clinical research in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking activated charcoal for 24 weeks, at a starting dose of 600 mg three times daily, increasing by 300 mg three times daily every 4 weeks until the goal phosphate level is reached, reduces phosphate levels to the goal in over 90% of patients when compared with baseline (93611). The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nTooth whitening. It is unclear if toothpaste containing activated charcoal is beneficial for tooth whitening.\nA small clinical study in adults with dental stains due to factors such as coffee or tobacco use shows that using a toothpaste containing activated charcoal (Blanx Black, Coswell SpA) twice daily for 3 months reduces visible staining, dental plaque, and bleeding when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a micro-cleaning crystal toothpaste (Sensation White, Colgate) (111718).\nless\nWound healing. Research on the use of activated charcoal-containing dressings for wound healing is limited and conflicting.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that treating chronic venous leg ulcers with activated charcoal-containing dressings (Actisorb, Systagenix) for 6 weeks reduces ulcer size by 17% when compared with control occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings containing antibacterial or antiseptic agents (94731). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that treating pressure ulcers or venous leg ulcers with activated charcoal-containing dressings (Actisorb and Actisorb Silver 220, Systagenix) for 4 weeks does not significantly improve wound healing when compared with a hydrocolloid dressing (93603).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate activated charcoal for these uses.",

Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that activated charcoal decreases bile acid levels in pregnant patients with cholestasis (126).\nAnti-diarrhea effects\nIrinotecan-induced diarrhea is thought to be caused by the active metabolite SN38. This metabolite directly damages the intestinal mucosa. Activated charcoal may prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea by adsorbing the SN38 metabolite (93608).\nAnti-flatulence effects\nAs activated charcoal is able to adsorb many drugs, it has also been shown to adsorb gases, suggesting that it might have a role in reducing flatulence after gas-producing meals (12395).\nDrug adsorption effects\nActivated charcoal adsorbs many drugs, increasing clearance and decreasing elimination half-life. It binds unabsorbed drugs in the gastrointestinal tract. It also binds drugs that diffuse or are transported from the circulation back into the intestine, and interrupts enterohepatic circulation of drugs. By this latter mechanism it can reduce exposure to drugs administered intravenously, including amiodarone, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, lorazepam, methotrexate, metronidazole, morphine, mycophenolate, phenytoin, valproate, and others (12392, 103192, 105543, 105816, 105817, 105818).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is growing interest in the use of activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion in patients with celiac disease. Mechanistically, this treatment may not be effective because the molecular weight of gluten proteins exceeds the maximum weight adsorbed by activated charcoal. However, in a survey of approximately 1600 individuals with celiac disease, 26% (424 patients) had heard of using activated charcoal for acute gluten exposure and 47% of these patients had tried this intervention (108854).\nLipid effects\nActivated charcoal is believed to decrease serum cholesterol levels by interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Cholesterol is needed to produce bile acids, and is used in larger amounts as bile acid synthesis is increased to normalize levels (12397).\nWound healing properties\nBased on in vitro and animal research, activated charcoal-containing dressings are believed to promote wound healing by adsorbing bacteria, local toxins, and wound degradation products (93603, 93614)."

Intravenous or intracoronary adenosine does not seem to be beneficial for acute coronary syndrome. Oral adenosine has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nA meta-analysis of 17 clinical studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing revascularization shows that administration of intracoronary or intravenous adenosine does not reduce major adverse cardiac events when compared with placebo. Adenosine also does not reduce all-cause death, non-fatal MI, or heart failure when compared with placebo. However, adenosine is associated with an increased risk of atrioventricular block (111744). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. In addition, most studies were in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention; the generalizability of these results to patients treated with thrombolysis is unclear.\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), however, has demonstrated bioavailability after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of AMP reach peak levels at 30-60 minutes after oral administration (93690).\nDistribution\nDuring continuous intravenous infusion of 25-75 mcg/kg/minute, ATP is taken up by erythrocytes and reaches dose-dependent plateau levels that are 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than baseline within 24 hours (9158).\nMetabolism\nAdenosine is cleared rapidly from the blood by adenosine deaminase, which is found in erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells (106424). ATP is broken down to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), then to AMP, and then to adenosine. The ultimate metabolite of adenosine is uric acid. This conversion occurs rapidly (9148).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of adenosine and ATP given by rapid intravenous injection is 0.6 to 1.5 seconds (9148). ATP taken up by erythrocytes has a half-life of 6 hours (9158).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAdenosine is a purine nucleoside that is present in all human cells and involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, including cellular metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, neurotransmission, muscle contraction, cardiac function, platelet function, vasodilation, and liver glycogen metabolism (9148, 9150).\nCardiovascular effects\nAdenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) both have negative inotropic, dromotropic, and chronotropic effects on the heart. ATP exerts its activity after degradation to adenosine. Adenosine stimulates the release of potassium in the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodal cells, which depresses cardiac conduction (9148). Adenosine and ATP given intravenously act in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by causing a transient AV block, and preventing re-entrant atrial tachyarrhythmias (15). ATP and its degradation products, adenosine diphosphate and adenosine, may help attenuate ischemic tissue trauma. These compounds seem to slow the progression of ischemia involved in alterations of cellular energy and depletion of ATP stores (10066). Adenosine also increases blood flow in normal coronary arteries but has little effect in stenotic arteries, allowing the difference to be detected by thallium imaging during a cardiac stress test (15).\nMetabolic effects\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) might prevent cachexia in people with cancer by crossing the cell membrane and altering metabolic activity. Weight loss seems to occur due to conversion of glucose to lactate in peripheral tissues followed by gluconeogenesis from lactate in the liver. ATP seems to inhibit gluconeogenesis, which might contribute to maintenance of body fat and cell mass in people with cancer (9149, 9151, 9153, 9159).\nPro-erectile activity\nSome animal research suggests that adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) have pro-erectile activity (93690)."

People with this disorder have increased absorption of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol from the diet, and decreased clearance of beta-sitosterol. Total body stores of beta-sitosterol are increased up to 17-fold. Elevated hepatic beta-sitosterol levels competitively inhibit cholesterol catabolism, contributing to hypercholesterolemia (3663). Patients with sitosterolemia are prone to premature coronary artery disease and xanthomas (3661, 3662). Beta-sitosterol and its glycoside, sitosterolin, are contraindicated in patients with sitosterolemia. However, beta-sitosterol appears to be safe for heterozygous carriers of sitosterolemia (10457).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nHypoxoside, a constituent of African wild potato, is converted to rooperol in the gut prior to absorption (94283).\nMetabolism\nRooperol is rapidly metabolized in the colon and liver to diglucuronide, disulphate and mixed glucuronide-sulphate metabolites (30489, 94283).\nExcretion\nRooperol is excreted in the urine mainly as diglucuronide, disulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates (30488).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of African wild potato is the rootstalk, or corm. The African wild potato corm contains 3.5% to 4.5% lignans. Hypoxoside, a norlignan glycoside, is the primary lignan constituent (13582, 94283). African wild potato also contains beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterolin, and is sometimes used as a commercial source of beta-sitosterol (5327, 5328, 7198).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThe anti-cancer effects of African wild potato might be related to rooperol, a metabolite of the constituent hypoxoside. In laboratory research, rooperol inhibits the potential for cancer cell invasion and also demonstrates antioxidant effects (94283). African wild potato is also a source of beta-sitosterol, which is thought to decrease prostate cell proliferation (5328).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that African wild potato might have anti-inflammatory and free-radical scavenging activity. African wild potato seems to inhibit the production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 prostaglandin biosynthesis (13583). The anti-inflammatory effects of African wild potato might be related to rooperol, a metabolite of the constituent hypoxoside. Rooperol inhibits the enzyme lipoxygenase, potentially reducing the formation of inflammatory eicosanoids. Rooperol also appears to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines (94283). The anti-inflammatory effects of African wild potato and its constituents might explain the potential benefits of the extract for benign prostatic hyperplasia (94283).\nAntibacterial effects\nAfrican wild potato seems to modestly inhibit Escherichia coli growth. However, it is unlikely to have an antibacterial effect at the doses typically used (13583).\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) effects\nIn vitro research shows that African wild potato extract inhibits the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4/5 (94281). However, CYP inhibitory activity has not been reported or evaluated in humans.\nHypoglycemic effects\nAnimal research suggests that African wild potato might lower blood glucose levels (11236, 30483).

The effects of agar on bilirubin levels in infants with neonatal jaundice are unclear, as results from clinical research are conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that administering agar 0.6-2 grams daily for up to 5 days does not reduce bilirubin levels in infants with neonatal jaundice when compared to control (30491, 30493, 30504, 30505, 30507).

This absorption is enhanced by a tight junction disrupter (cytochalasin B), indicating that the oligosaccharides are absorbed through the tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells (112326).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAgar is a linear galactan extracted from red seaweed (Laminaria digitata). It contains the fibrous polysaccharides, agarose and agaropectin. Agarose is the gelling fraction of agar (11, 112325, 112326). Two types of oligosaccharides are present, agaro-oligosaccharides and neoagaro-oligosaccharides, The agaro-oligosaccharides include agarobiose, agarotetraose, and agarohexaose (112326).\n\nAgar also contains the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium. It is also rich in vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacin, pantothenic acid, folate, choline, vitamin E, vitamin K, and the carotenoids lycopene and lutein. Agar is rich in fatty acids but low in saturated fat and cholesterol (30520).\nAntiaging effects\nIn a mouse model of accelerated aging, agar reverses aging-related changes including increased fat and decreased collagen in the skin, sponginess and tangles in brain cells, and hepatocyte damage. It also reduces expression of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1-beta and IL-6, in the brain and liver, and increases levels of antioxidant enzymes, elastin, and hyaluronic acid in the skin (112325).\nAntidiabetic effects\nDietary fibers like agar can inhibit postprandial increases in blood glucose by slowing down the movement of glucose from the stomach to the small intestine or by obstructing absorption of glucose in the small intestine (30502, 30511, 30518).\nAntioxidant activity\nIn vitro research shows that agaro-oligosaccharides (AOs) derived from agar have antioxidant activity (30498). AOs also exert in vitro and in vivo hepatoprotective effects by scavenging oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species. Intracellular tests show that AOs improve cell viability and scavenge oxidants in hepatocytes. In rats, AOs significantly elevated the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as decreased levels of malondialdehyde and transaminases in carbon tetrachloride-induced peroxidative liver damage (30498).\nBilirubin-reducing effects\nAgar treatment is associated with reduced peak serum bilirubin levels in neonatal jaundice (30504, 30517, 30512), although other clinical research shows conflicting results or a lack of an effect (30505, 30491, 30516, 30493, 30510). In the neonate, the absence of intestinal flora prevents the degradation of bilirubin in stool to products that can be excreted, such as urobilinogen. The success of agar as a treatment for neonatal jaundice depends on its ability to bind bilirubin and prevent absorption (30494).\nCholesterol effects\nDietary fibers like agar are believed to work in the intestine to reduce dietary fat and cholesterol uptake (30490). They absorb bile acid synthesized from cholesterol by the liver, thus obstructing bile-acid absorption (30495). They also protract digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and lipids (30490, 30497).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAgar is a water-soluble indigestible fiber and a hydrophilic colloid and is thought to work as a bulk laxative by stimulating peristalsis in the intestines (11). Certain dietary fibers and fiber derivatives may affect the bioavailability of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract. Some viscous fiber derivatives may delay gastric emptying, alter the interaction of digestive enzymes with substrates in the intestine, and affect absorption of nutrients (30501). In a clinical gastric emptying study, a meal containing 2 grams of agar delayed gastric emptying, but had no impact on the postprandial glucose response (30499).\nWeight loss effects\nDietary fibers like agar may be useful for weight loss and appetite suppression, as they may increase satiety by slowing gastric emptying (30499, 30515, 30514, 30513)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of agaricus mushroom are the mycelia and fruiting body. Agaricus mushroom contains polysaccharides, proteins, proteoglycans, polysaccharide-protein complexes, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, steroids, fiber, linoleic acid, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, ergosterol, and potassium (15402, 15408, 15411).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome clinical and in vitro research shows that agaricus mushroom extracts decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects. However, agaricus mushroom only led to marginal-to-moderate reductions in cytokines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting that other mechanisms may explain the clinical efficacy of agaricus mushroom in these patients (94714).\nAnti-obesity effects\nAnimal research shows that rats fed an agaricus mushroom extract in conjunction with a high-fat diet gain less weight than those fed the high-fat diet alone. This seems to be due to an increase in energy expenditure and locomotor activity, and a decrease in pancreatic lipase activity, which reduces lipid absorption (102918).\nAnti-tumor effects\nFractions of agaricus mushroom seem to stimulate monocyte production of interleukin-12 and result in anti-tumor activity in vitro (15402). Extracts of agaricus mushroom, particularly beta-glucans extracts, also have anti-tumor and immunostimulant effects in animal models (15405, 15406, 15412, 15413, 15414, 94716). In mice, an aqueous extract of agaricus mushroom given orally or applied topically delays the onset, and reduces the incidence of chemically-induced papillomas, which can progress to cancer (102917). Ergosterol and sodium pyroglutamate constituents of agaricus mushroom might have antiangiogenic effects on tumors (15415, 15416). Other preliminary research suggests agaricus mushroom might have antimutagenic effects, mediated through suppression of the procarcinogenic effects of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes. Researchers speculate that this activity could prevent the metabolism of procarcinogens to carcinogens in the body (15403, 15408, 15409, 15410, 15411).\nAntibacterial effects\nResearch in animal models shows that agaricus mushroom has anti-streptococcal activity (15419).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn vitro research shows that agaricus mushroom extracts increase glucose uptake in cultured hepG2 human liver cells, and also reduce breakdown of starch and disaccharides to glucose by alpha-glucosidase (102920). These actions could reduce postprandial glucose levels if they occur in humans. Agaricus mushroom might also have antidiabetes activity by increasing serum adiponectin, which decreases insulin resistance in humans with type 2 diabetes (15421). Beta-glucans and oligosaccharide extracts of agaricus mushroom have shown antihyperglycemic activity in animal models (15420).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that a polysaccharide extracted from agaricus mushroom and an ethyl acetate extract of agaricus mushroom have antioxidant effects (15417, 102920).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome preliminary research indicates that the beta-glucans and oligosaccharide extracts of agaricus mushroom have anti-atherosclerotic activity in animal models (15420).\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary clinical and animal research suggests that an aqueous extract of agaricus mushroom might have hepatoprotective effects (15418). However, three cases of severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in females receiving chemotherapy for breast or ovarian cancer who took agaricus mushroom supplements (16458).\nImmunostimulant effects\nPreliminary research suggests agaricus mushroom might have immunostimulant effects (15407, 94716). In vitro and animal research suggests it might enhance the production of cytokines such as interferon and interleukin (15401, 15402). Fractions of agaricus also seem to stimulate monocyte production of interleukin-12 and result in anti-tumor activity in vitro (15402). Extracts of agaricus mushroom, particularly beta-glucans extracts, also have anti-tumor and immunostimulant effects in animal models (15405, 15406, 15412, 15413, 15414). There is interest in using agaricus mushroom as a biologic response modifier adjunct to chemotherapy.

Additional animal research shows that agmatine crosses the blood brain barrier when administered via intravenous or intraperitoneal injection (94739).\nMetabolism\nAgmatine undergoes hydrolysis and oxidation. In a study of rat liver cells, agmatine was primarily metabolized to 4-guanidinobutyraldehyde or left unchanged. Around 10% of the agmatine dose was transformed to other polyamines (94732, 94743). The liver plays a vital role in the regulation of agmatine homeostasis in humans (94732).\nExcretion\nAgmatine has a half-life of approximately 2 hours (94734).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAgmatine, an endogenous polyamine, is synthesized from L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase. It has been shown to play an important role in the metabolism of other polyamines and the modulation of numerous molecular pathways, including nitric oxide synthesis and neurotransmitter receptor activity (94734).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nAnimal and in vitro research show that agmatine has mild hypoglycemic effects. Mechanisms of these effects include increased cellular uptake of glucose, direct insulin-like effects, and increased insulin release via interaction with pancreatic islet beta cells (94734).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome research shows that chronic agmatine treatment has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing inflammatory cytokine levels along with the signs and symptoms of arthritis in rats and allergic airway inflammation in mice (94733, 111143).\nAntidepressant effects\nMultiple laboratory studies and case reports show that agmatine has antidepressant effects (94734, 94735, 94742, 94743, 100960). Additionally, agmatine concentrations in the brain of patients who died by suicide have been shown to be lower than those of patients who died from accidents or natural causes, suggesting that agmatine may play a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression and suicidal ideation (100959). Potential mechanisms of agmatine's antidepressant effects include modulation of nitric oxide synthesis, induction of antioxidant defense systems, inhibition of potassium ion channels, and modulation of neurotransmitter receptors. Agmatine has been shown to modulate NMDA, alpha-2 adrenergic, serotonin, opioid, and imidazoline receptors; however, unlike with most antidepressants, very little evidence suggests that agmatine's modulation of serotonin receptors is responsible for its antidepressant activity. Most research supports the notion that imidazoline receptors are most involved in agmatine's antidepressant effects (94734).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome research shows that chronic agmatine treatment reduces markers of oxidative stress in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation (111143).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal research shows that agmatine has anxiolytic effects, likely due to modulation of imidazoline receptors (94734).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that agmatine produces mild reductions in heart rate and blood pressure, possibly due to modulation of nitric oxide production, norepinephrine release, and imidazoline receptors (94734). Other animal research shows that agmatine has cardioprotective effects, enhancing recovery in a rat heart model of ischemia (94734).\nCognitive effects\nSome research shows that agmatine can slow cognitive decline and reduce the accumulation of amyloid beta in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. These improvements were correlated with an improvement in insulin activity in the brain (94738). Agmatine has also been found to improve learning and memory in animal models, possibly via a reduction in nitric oxide synthase activity (93734).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research suggests that agmatine might prevent increases in body weight and lipid levels caused by antipsychotic treatment. In a rat model of olanzapine-induced obesity and metabolic dysregulation, chronic agmatine administration reduced body weight and lipid levels, possibly by decreasing feeding efficiency and increasing the activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), a lipogenic enzyme involved in lipid metabolism (111142).\nNephroprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that agmatine can enhance glomerular filtration rate in rats. This may be explained by activation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium release and subsequent vasodilation in the kidneys (94734).\nNeurologic effects\nA large body of animal and in vitro research shows that agmatine has neuroprotective effects in models of stroke, central nervous system (CNS) injury, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, glaucoma, fragile X syndrome, and other neurodegenerative disorders (94734, 94735, 94743, 100960, 111145). Possible mechanisms for these effects include modulation of neurotransmitter receptors, modulation of ion channels, and inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis (94734, 111145).\n\nThere is also interest in using agmatine in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Some research shows that patients with autism have lower plasma agmatine levels than their neurotypical peers. This suggests that agmatine may play a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of autism (94741).\nOpioid effects\nAnimal and in vitro research shows that agmatine potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids and inhibits opioid dependence, likely via modulation of neurotransmitter receptors and nitric oxide synthesis (94734)."

This may be attributed to polyphenols in the herb and was based on a screening of aqueous extracts from 21 traditional herbs used in southern China (30555).\nHepatoprotective effects\nTraditionally, agrimony is used for liver disease. Taking agrimony has been shown to reduce levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in individuals with elevated levels at baseline. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also reduced. Other liver enzymes were not affected (102702). In vitro, agrimonolide, a constituent of agrimony root, has demonstrated hepatoprotective effects on both tacrine-induced cytotoxicity and tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cytotoxicity (30554).\nVasorelaxant effects\nAgrimony is of interest for its cardiotonic properties. In vitro, agrimony extract has vasorelaxant properties, mediated in part by cyclooxygenase derived mediators (109703).\nWound healing effects\nAgrimony is traditionally used for wound healing.

Small clinical studies suggest that oral alanine may modestly reduce iatrogenic hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking 20-40 grams of L-alpha-alanine orally produces a sustained rise in blood glucose levels after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes (14612, 16020). The rise is more prolonged than after 20 grams of oral glucose or 1 mg of subcutaneous glucagon (14612). Other preliminary clinical research also shows that patients with type 1 diabetes had more consistent and prolonged protection against nocturnal hypoglycemia after taking 40 grams of L-alpha-alanine plus 10 grams of glucose orally with a bedtime dose of NPH insulin than when they consumed a snack with the insulin dose (16019).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral alanine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking D-alpha-alanine orally 100 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks improves positive and negative symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia that were also on a stable antipsychotic regimen when compared with placebo (16027).\nless\nStress. Although there has been interest in using oral alanine for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alanine for this purpose.\nGlycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease). It is unclear if oral alanine is beneficial in patients with Pompe disease.\nA case series of 5 patients aged 15-47 years with late-onset glycogen storage disease type II shows that taking L-alpha-alanine 0.14 grams/kg daily, divided into 3 doses, for 4 weeks decreased resting energy expenditure, protein turnover, and catabolism when compared with baseline. However, measures of Pompe disease-associated myopathy were not reported. The validity of this study is limited by its small size and the lack of a comparator group (16444).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate alanine for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of alanine.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe chemical formula of alanine is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH, giving it a chiral center and the optical isomers, L-alpha-alanine and D-alpha-alanine. L-alpha-alanine is a non-essential amino acid used in protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis. It is obtained from dietary proteins, by conversion from other amino acids, and by metabolism of glucose via pyruvate. The liver sequesters about 70% of L-alpha-alanine absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and about 17% of this is used in protein synthesis. The rest is converted to pyruvate, lactate, acetyl-coenzyme A, and oxaloacetic acid, which are used for energy production and gluconeogenesis (16023).\n\nD-alpha-alanine is found in some plant-derived foods, in marine invertebrates, and in bacterial cell walls. It has also been detected in the human brain, both as a component of proteins and in the free form (16447, 16448).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using alanine for diabetes. Animal research in diabetic rats shows that taking L-alpha-alanine orally 300 mg/kg daily for 14-21 days reduces blood glucose levels and improves serum creatinine and liver function enzyme levels when compared with control. However, a lower dose of L-alpha-alanine, 150 mg/kg daily, did not affect blood glucose levels. Taking L-alpha-alanine also did not appear to affect most serum lipid levels, but one study in diabetic rats suggests that L-alpha-alanine may reduce very low-density lipoprotein levels (106709, 112788). Histopathological analysis of pancreatic and hepatic tissue from diabetic animals suggests that L-alpha-alanine may protect pancreatic acini, islet of Langerhans cells, and hepatocytes normally damaged by diabetes (112788).\n\nConversely, L-alpha-alanine increases hepatic glucose production. However, researchers theorize that inducing ketosis reduces the amount of L-alpha-alanine available for hepatic gluconeogenesis and adipose tissue lipolysis, which might improve blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. L-alpha-alanine is formed by transamination of pyruvate in skeletal muscle then is released into the bloodstream and taken up by the liver. In the liver, L-alpha-alanine is transformed back into pyruvate which is used to fuel gluconeogenesis. Human research suggests that inducing ketosis through consumption of a synthetic ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate reduces L-alpha-alanine levels. Ketone oxidation decreases intramuscular pyruvate availability, resulting in reduced conversion into L-alpha-alanine available to the liver for hepatic gluconeogenesis (107991).\n\nDue to its effects on hepatic glucose production, there is also interest in using alanine for hypoglycemia. L-alpha-alanine stimulates glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, increasing hepatic glucose production and therefore raising blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes (14612, 16019, 16020, 16445). It does not significantly affect C-peptide or insulin levels in people with type 1 diabetes (16020). The glycemic effects of a 20-40 gram oral dose of L-alpha-alanine in people with type 1 diabetes are seen within 20 minutes, peak at 3-4 hours, and persist for at least 6 hours (16020). L-alpha-alanine can further increase blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes who are already hyperglycemic (16020). Conversely, in people who do not have diabetes, L-alpha-alanine increases glucagon secretion and glucose production, and also increases insulin levels, preventing a rise in plasma glucose levels (16020). There is also some preliminary evidence that an IV infusion of alanine can improve performance in some cognitive tests during hypoglycemia, suggesting that it can partially substitute for glucose as a brain fuel during hypoglycemia (16445).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research in diabetic rats shows that taking L-alpha-alanine orally 150-300 mg/kg daily for 21 days improves organ levels of glutathione, but not malondialdehyde (MDA), when compared with control (106709). However, another study in diabetic rats suggests that L-alanine reduces MDA levels in the liver and kidney, but not in the pancreas or spleen. Additionally, L-alanine increases glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels in the spleen, but not in the liver, kidney, or pancreas. Researchers theorize that amino acids such as L-alpha-alanine may mitigate diabetes-induced oxidative stress (112788).\nElectrolyte effects\nL-alpha-alanine enhances absorption of sodium and water from the small intestine, possibly by a different mechanism to glucose, leading to interest in its use in oral rehydration solutions (16021, 16028).\nErgogenic effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that L-alpha-alanine increases the mitochondrial supply of oxaloacetate, reducing hepatic ketone body production. This might reduce ketosis after prolonged physical exertion (16446).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using L-alpha-alanine in treatment of glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease). This disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase), leading to accumulation of glycogen in muscle lysosomes, which disrupts muscle function. It is broadly classified into infantile and late onset forms, depending on residual enzyme activity and the age of onset. There is progressive skeletal and respiratory myopathy in both forms, and also cardiomyopathy in the infantile form. Increased total body protein breakdown occurs, probably due to increased muscle turnover. L-alpha-alanine plays a role in energy metabolism and can decrease catabolism of branched-chain amino acids for energy production. This might conserve muscle protein and be beneficial in glycogen storage disease type II (16026, 16443, 16444).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nThere is interest in using D-alpha-alanine for schizophrenia, mood disorders, and stress. D-alpha-alanine in the CNS is an endogenous agonist at the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is a type of glutamate receptor. Reduced function of this receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (16027).\n\nLevels of D-alpha-alanine are increased in post-mortem samples from the brains of people with Alzheimer disease, but the clinical implications of this finding are unclear (16447, 16448).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of D-alpha-alanine 60 mg/kg orally improves processing and identification time of emotions, when compared with D-serine 60 mg/kg or placebo. However, taking D-alpha-alanine did not affect memory or saliva cortisol levels (106682)."

Its sprouts are also consumed by humans, often as a garnish, and various parts of the alfalfa plant have been used in dietary supplements (30565). Traditionally, alfalfa has been used for a variety of medical conditions, including gastrointestinal complaints, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), asthma, menstrual irregularities, and bladder, kidney, and prostate issues.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when the leaves are used orally and appropriately, short-term (4, 6, 12).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when large amounts are used long-term. Chronic ingestion of alfalfa has been associated with drug-induced lupus effects (381, 14828, 30602).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in medicinal amounts. Alfalfa contains constituents with possible estrogenic activity (4, 11, 30592).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, alfalfa leaf seems to be well tolerated. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and flatulence.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Lupus-like syndrome after chronic ingestion of alfalfa.\nDermatologic\nDermatitis associated with alfalfa use has been reported. In a 1954 publication, dermatitis was noted in a 61-year-old female consuming 4-6 cups of tea made with two tablespoonfuls of alfalfa seeds for approximately two months prior to onset. Examination revealed diffuse, confluent edema and erythema on the face, eyelids, ears, hands, forearms, and distal humeral regions. The dermatitis improved with treatment; re-exposure to alfalfa resulted in a similar reaction (30609).\nless\nEndocrine\nAlfalfa contains constituents, including coumestrol, with reported estrogenic activity (30586, 30592, 4753). Effects in humans are not known.\n\nOne case report documents hypokalemia in a female who had been drinking a \"cleansing tea\" containing alfalfa, licorice, and stinging nettle. The potassium level returned to normal after discontinuing the tea and initiating potassium supplementation. The specific cause of the hypokalemia is not clear. Notably, both stinging nettle and licorice have been associated with hypokalemia and may have been responsible for this effect (30562).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, flatulence and bulkier feces were reported during the first week of a case series of three subjects ingesting alfalfa (30598). In a case series of 15 patients ingesting alfalfa, increased fecal volume and increased stool frequency was reported. Additional adverse effects included abdominal discomfort in two patients, diarrhea in two patients, loose stools in six patients, and intestinal gas in 13 patients (5816).\nless\nHematologic\nPancytopenia and splenomegaly were reported in a 59-year-old male who had been taking 80-160 grams of ground alfalfa seeds for up to six weeks at a time, for a five month period. Hematologic values and spleen size returned to normal when alfalfa was discontinued (381).\nless\nOther\nAlfalfa products, including sprouts, seeds, and tablets, have been found to be contaminated with Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes, which have caused documented infections (5600, 30566, 30568, 30572, 30569, 30564, 30604, 30610, 30563, 30607) (30566, 30564, 30604, 30610, 30563, 30607, 30576).\n\nOrally, alfalfa has been associated with the development of a lupus-like syndrome in animals and humans (30594, 14828, 14830, 30602), as well as with possible exacerbations of lupus in patients with known systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These reactions may be associated with the amino acid L-canavanine (30594), which appears to be present in alfalfa seeds and sprouts, but not leaves, and therefore should not be present in alfalfa tablets manufactured from the leaves (30601). However, case reports have included individuals ingesting tablets. A lupus-like syndrome was described in four patients taking 12-24 alfalfa tablets per day. Symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, and rash; positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) arose anywhere from three weeks to seven months after initiating alfalfa therapy. Upon discontinuation of alfalfa tablets, all four patients became asymptomatic. In two patients, ANA levels normalized (14828). Two additional reports have documented possible exacerbation or induction of SLE associated with alfalfa use. One case involved a female with a 26-year history of SLE, who had been taking 15 tablets of alfalfa daily for nine months prior to an exacerbation. Because of the delay in onset of the exacerbation from the initiation of alfalfa therapy, causation cannot be clearly established (30575). In a different report, SLE and arthritis were found in multiple family members who had been taking a combination of vitamin E and alfalfa tablets for seven years (30602). It is not known what other environmental or genetic factors may have affected these individuals, and the association with alfalfa is unclear.\nless",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of alfalfa is the whole plant. Vitamins A, C, E, and K, minerals, and trace elements are present in alfalfa. Alfalfa contains coumestrol, a phytoestrogen that has been isolated from three commercially available alfalfa products (30592). Flavonoids have also been isolated from alfalfa (30565), as have high concentrations of manganese (30608).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAlfalfa may possess antimicrobial properties (30581). G2, 2-beta-hydroxy-3-beta-O- (beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-delta 12-oleanene-23, 28-dionic acid, has been isolated from alfalfa roots. In vitro, this constituent has demonstrated activity against Cryptococcus neoformans (30582) and a wide range of yeast strains (30578). Medicagenic acid, hederagenin glycosides, and soyasapogenols may contribute to the antifungal actions of alfalfa, including against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis (30603).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAlfalfa has been found to significantly lower basal plasma glucose concentrations in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (14907). In a different study, diabetic mice fed alfalfa (62.5g/kg in the diet and 2.5g/L in drinking water) experienced reduced hyperglycemia when compared with normal mice (30605).\nImmunologic effects\nThe alfalfa constituent L-canavanine, an amino acid, has been associated with the development of a lupus-like syndrome, or exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in animals and humans (30594, 30579, 14829). In vitro, alfalfa appears to act on CD8 Leu8 T cells to regulate antibody synthesis and proliferation (30580). L-canavanine may exert an inhibitory effect on CD8 T cells (14829), and may also exert effects on mononuclear cells (30579).\nLipid effects\nA study in monkeys found that monkeys fed alfalfa saponins had decreased cholesterolemia without changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) when compared to monkeys not fed alfalfa saponins (30599). It was also noted that alfalfa saponins decrease intestinal absorption and increase fecal excretion of cholesterol, a finding also reported in rats (30588). Alfalfa has been shown to prevent the expected rise in cholesterol associated with intake of a high cholesterol diet in monkeys (30585). Alfalfa reduces lipid levels in plasma and tissues more effectively than D-thyroxine and pyrimidine, but not as effectively as cholestyramine or diets completely devoid of cholesterol (30600). Similar cholesterol-lowering effects have been observed in rabbits (30589, 30587, 30583). Following oral administration of cholesterol to rabbits, elevations in serum cholesterol were prevented when feedings included alfalfa (30589). Hyperlipidemia-induced rabbits fed alfalfa were found to have lower total cholesterol, specifically triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids, when compared to rabbits not fed alfalfa (30567). A study in 72 monkeys showed that diets consisting of alfalfa and cholesterol reduced cholesterol levels and atherosclerotic plaque formation when compared with diets containing cholesterol alone (30606, 30611).\nWound healing effects\nEarly reports suggest that an unsaponifiable substance extracted from alfalfa appears to be beneficial in treating skin damage secondary to radiotherapy and healing gums after orthodontist operations. The substance contained cycloartenol, sitosterol, campestrol, and stigonosterol (30612)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Algal oil is a type of oil derived from marine algae such as Crypthecodinium, Nannochloropsis, Schizochytrium, Prototheca, or Ulkenia species (90669, 98541, 98551, 109214). These algae are preferentially cultivated using algaculture to produce algal oils rich in specific fatty acids, including oleic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (90669, 98541, 98546, 103314).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil is used orally and appropriately. Specific algal oils (DHASCO and DHASCO-S, Martek Biosciences Corp) have been safely used in clinical research at doses of 1.5-15 grams daily for 4-15 weeks (48254). One of these oils (DHASCO, Martek Biosciences Corp) has also been safely used in doses of about 1.5-9 grams, providing DHA 30 mg/kg, daily for up to 4 years (90684). These algal oils provide approximately 35% to 40% DHA, small amounts of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, and insignificant amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (48254). However, there is some concern that high intake of omega-3 fatty acids in algal oil might increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of DHA plus EPA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched algal oil is used orally and appropriately. A specific algal oil supplement (Almega PL) providing EPA 250 mg daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks (103314). However, there is some concern that high intake of omega-3 fatty acids in algal oil might increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of DHA plus EPA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Algal oil contains docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is some concern that taking more than 3 grams of EPA plus DHA daily might decrease platelet aggregation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of DHA plus EPA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil has been safely used as a source of DHA in some infant formulas since 2002 (5941, 48084, 48095, 48343, 98548). One specific type of algal oil (DHASCO) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in infant formula when combined with a fungal-derived arachidonic acid oil (ARASCO) (48176). In children 7 years and older, this same algal oil (DHASCO) providing DHA 30 mg/kg daily has been used safely for up to 4 years (90684). Algal oil 1-2.4 grams providing 0.4-1 grams of DHA daily has also been safely used in children ages 4 years and older for up to 1 year (11333, 90665, 104560). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched algal oils in children.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil is commonly included as a component of prenatal vitamins. Algal oil providing DHA 400-600 mg daily during pregnancy has been used with apparent safety in most clinical research (90672, 90694). When taken as a prenatal supplement, DHA-enriched algal oil increases DHA levels in breast milk (90685). Taking DHA-enriched algal oil during lactation also increases levels of DHA in breast milk (109214, 110362). One study found that using DHA-enriched algal oil during lactation increased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in breastfed infants born at less than 29 weeks gestational age; however, it is unclear if this was due to DHA or various confounding factors (104559). The tolerable upper intake level of DHA during pregnancy or lactation has not been established. Most experts recommend an intake of DHA 200-300 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation. While it is typically advised that this need be met by consuming 8-12 ounces of seafood weekly during pregnancy and 4-8 ounces weekly during lactation, individuals with nutrient deficiency or those following a vegan diet may meet this need with supplementation, including algal oil (95740, 95741).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched algal oils during pregnancy or lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, algal oil is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Fishy burps and gastrointestinal symptoms.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil (median dose of DHA 1.68 grams daily) can modestly increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by about 8% in patients without coronary heart disease. This increase in LDL cholesterol is similar to that observed for patients taking purified DHA 4 grams daily (90669).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, one parent of a pediatric patient treated with algal oil providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 600 mg daily for 16 weeks reported increased hair loss beginning 6 weeks after completion of supplementation (90699). It is unclear if this adverse effect is specifically related to algal oil intake. Algal oil may theoretically cause itching, rash, or warmth in the hands due to its constituents DHA and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (15497, 48217); however, while these adverse effects have been reported with other sources of DHA and EPA, they have not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, fishy burps and mild nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in clinical research for participants taking algal oil providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 600 mg daily for 2 weeks (48220). Algal oil may theoretically cause other adverse events including nausea, vomiting, flatulence, and loose stools due to its DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) constituents (1009, 1313, 8699, 10007, 10869, 11333, 15497, 103314); however, these adverse effects have not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, algal oil may theoretically cause decreased libido due to its constituent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In one clinical study, one patient taking DHA 1, 2, or 4 grams daily (specific dose unclear) reported decreased libido (48217); however, this adverse effect has not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, algal oil might cause nose bleeds, but this is uncommon. Onset of severe nose bleeds has been reported in one clinical study in one child who took algal oil providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 600 mg daily (98542). Some algal oil may theoretically decrease blood coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding in some patients due to its fatty acid constituents (1009, 1313, 8699, 10007, 15497); however, the potential risk might depend on the ratio of DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the algal oil. Most clinical research shows that DHA alone does not affect blood clotting (11112, 11113, 48020). Therefore, algal oils containing high amounts of DHA and negligible amounts of EPA seem unlikely to increase the risk. However, there is evidence that taking high doses of oils providing EPA and DHA might decrease blood coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of EPA plus DHA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739). While these adverse effects have not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil, patients should limit intake of algal oil to daily doses providing no more than 2 grams of EPA and DHA.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, algal oil may theoretically cause joint pain due to its constituent, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), although results are conflicting. In one clinical study, a higher percentage of patients treated with EPA ethyl ester 2 or 4 grams daily experienced arthralgia compared to placebo (3.4% and 1.7% vs 0.4%, respectively) (91409). However, in another study, slightly fewer patients taking EPA ethyl ester 1.8 grams daily experienced joint, lumbar, or muscle pain compared to placebo (1.6% vs 2.0%, respectively) (15497). These adverse effects have not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, algal oil may theoretically cause insomnia or light-headedness/dizziness due to its constituent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In one clinical study, three adult patients reported light-headedness or dizziness, and one patient reported insomnia, when treated with DHA 2 grams daily. It is unclear if these events are treatment related, as one patient in the placebo group also reported insomnia (10869). These adverse effects have not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless\nOncologic\nOrally, algal oil may theoretically increase the risk of prostate cancer due to its constituent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, further research is needed to clarify this finding. An analysis of data from observational studies found that higher DHA intake is associated with a non-linear increased risk of prostate cancer (90677). However, it is unclear if supplemental DHA intake is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, and this association has not been reported specifically for patients taking algal oil.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nPreterm labor. Most research shows that taking oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil seems to prevent preterm labor in those with low DHA status at baseline.\nA large clinical trial shows that taking algal oil (Life's DHA) 2 grams, providing DHA 1000 mg daily during pregnancy, starting at 12-20 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, results in an early preterm birth rate of 1.7%, compared with 2.4% in those taking algal oil providing DHA 200 mg daily. Benefits were strongest in those with low DHA status at baseline, with no benefit in those with high DHA status at baseline and in those with high adherence to DHA 1000 mg daily (109204, 110360). A secondary analysis of two studies shows that taking algal oil providing DHA 800 mg modestly reduces the early preterm and preterm birth rates in those with a low DHA status at baseline compared with taking algal oil providing DHA 200 mg (110361).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil does not seem to improve cognitive function in most children.\nIn healthy children aged 7-12 years in rural China, clinical research shows that taking DHA-enriched algal oil 800 mg daily for 6 months does not improve measures of executive function when compared with placebo (104560). In addition, although some clinical research shows that taking DHA-enriched algal oil 1500 mg daily for 16 weeks improves reading scores when compared with placebo in a subgroup of children ages 6-10 years who are below the 20th percentile for reading (90699), these results could not be replicated in a later study that included only children below the 20th percentile for reading (98542). The reason for this particular discrepancy is not clear. Both trials were conducted by the same researchers in a similar area of the UK. However, the methods for both reading instruction and proficiency changed in the time between these trials. Nevertheless, taking DHA-enriched algal oil does not appear to improve reading scores in children at or above the 20th percentile for reading, and there does not appear to be any benefit of algal oil on working memory in children (90699).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Most research shows that oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil does not improve symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nClinical research in infants, children, and young adults with cystic fibrosis shows that taking algal oil (DHA-basic, CASEN Fleet SLU) providing DHA 50 mg/kg daily for 48 weeks does not improve spirometry measures, reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa primary infections, or reduce the number of, or time to, total or severe pulmonary exacerbations when compared with placebo (109217). Also, small clinical studies show that taking algal oil providing DHA 70 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks, or 100 mg/kg daily for one month and then 1 gram daily for 11 months, does not improve lung function or overall health in patients with cystic fibrosis (48119, 90665).\nless\nFractures. Taking oral algal oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids does not seem to prevent fractures in older adults.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily from algal oil, providing 330 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 660 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not prevent fractures in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone, or with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or with strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nPhysical performance. Taking oral algal oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids does not seem to improve muscle strength in older adults.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily from algal oil, providing 330 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 660 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not improve muscle strength in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone, or with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or with strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral algal oil is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nOne large clinical study in adults with age-related cognitive decline shows that taking docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil providing DHA 900 mg daily for 24 weeks improves episodic memory and visuospatial learning when compared with placebo. However, working memory and executive function are not improved (90717). Conversely, a large clinical study in adults over 70 years of age shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily from algal oil, providing 330 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 660 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not improve Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores when compared with placebo.

It is unclear if oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil is beneficial for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very premature infants.\nClinical research shows that taking algal oil providing DHA 1.2 grams daily while breastfeeding, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, has no effect on mortality of breastfed infants or on survival without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. However, the occurrence of BPD in infants in the algal oil group was INCREASED when compared with those in the placebo group (104559). The conclusions of this study are limited by its early termination. In addition, about half of the infants in both groups received intravenous DHA-rich lipids per standard of clinical care. Also, more infants in the algal oil group were born via cesarean delivery, further confounding these findings.\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral algal oil for cancer prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of algal oil for this purpose.\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral oleic acid-enriched algal oil is beneficial for CHD prevention.\nSome algal oil products contain high quantities of oleic acid. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming 1.5 tablespoons daily of oils containing at least 70% oleic acid may reduce the risk of CHD. In order to obtain any benefit, this oil must be used to replace fats and oils higher in saturated fat. However, the FDA has determined that this statement is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (98563).\nless\nDepression. Although there is interest in using oral algal oil for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of algal oil for this condition.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral algal oil is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials involving 485 healthy adults shows that taking docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil, providing a median DHA dose of 1.68 grams, daily for 6 weeks reduces triglycerides by 15% and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5% when compared with placebo oils. However, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol modestly increased by 8% (90669). The effect of DHA-enriched algal oil on blood lipids or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart disease or hyperlipidemia is unknown. In individuals with borderline or true hypercholesterolemia, a small clinical trial shows that taking an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched algal oil (AlmegaPL) 1 gram daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces levels of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, but has no effect on triglyceride or LDL cholesterol levels (103314).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral algal oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial for hypertension.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily from algal oil, providing 330 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 660 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not reduce blood pressure in adults over 70 years of age, some of whom had self-reported hypertension, when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone, or with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or with strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nInfant development.

It is unclear if oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil during lactation or early in infancy is beneficial for increasing growth or neurodevelopment of the premature infant.\nClinical research in lactating individuals who delivered prior to 29 weeks' gestation shows that taking algal oil providing DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery and continuing until the infant reached 36 weeks postmenstrual age, might have beneficial effects on the growth of female infants, but not male infants, when compared with placebo. Weight velocity and weight gain were significantly increased in the female infants, with a weight gain of 52.6 grams. However, weight gain and weight velocity were not improved in the male infants, and weight at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was 89 grams less than those whose mothers took placebo (109221). In addition, there was no improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months corrected age (110364).\nless\nRetinitis pigmentosa. It is unclear if oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil is beneficial for retinitis pigmentosa.\nA small clinical study in males with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa shows that taking algal oil providing DHA 30 mg/kg daily for 4 years does not slow the loss of cone or rod electroretinography function (90683). However, a report of ancillary outcomes from this study shows that taking DHA might slow the rate of decline in final dark-adapted thresholds and visual field sensitivity in these patients (95738).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. It is unclear if oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched algal oil is beneficial for preventing retinopathy of prematurity in very premature infants.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking algal oil providing DHA 1.2 grams daily while breastfeeding, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, has no effect on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity in breastfeed infants at 36 weeks postmenstrual age when compared with placebo (104559).\nless\nSepsis.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with algal oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe fatty acids from algal oil are absorbed into the body and incorporated in plasma and cellular lipids. Taking algal oil containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and no additional omega-3 fatty acids increases levels of EPA and other omega-3 fatty acids in lipids in the plasma. EPA levels increase within 2 hours (98546). Algal oil containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) increases levels of these fatty acids in plasma (48108, 48120, 48176, 48220).\nDistribution\nTaking algal oil containing DHA increases levels of DHA, as well as EPA and some other fatty acids in erythrocytes, lipoproteins, and other membranes (48108, 48111, 48120, 48176, 48220, 98552, 103314, 104560).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlgal oil is a type of oil derived from various types of preferentially cultured marine algae (90669, 98541, 98551). The algae are cultured using specific conditions in order to maximize levels of the fatty acid of interest (98551). Specific strains of Prototheca moriformis have been genetically engineered to produce at least 25% oleic acid (98541). Crypthecodinium cohnii and species of Schizochytrium are used for the production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (98546, 98555, 104559, 109214, 109217). Nitzschia laevis and Nannochloropsis oculata are used for the production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (98546, 98555, 103314). Other species of microalgae, such as Dixioniella grisea and Isochrysis galbana, continue to be examined for their fatty acid nutritional value (98551).\n\nOn a dry weight basis, cultivated Schizochytrium can be up to 20% DHA, with DHA making up 50% or more of the oil (98544). Nannochloropsis oculate oil is 25% to 40% EPA (98546, 103314).\n\nAlgal oils are preferentially produced to provide only the desired polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA, EPA, or oleic acid), providing little to none of the other polyunsaturated fatty acids (98555). For example, Schizochytrium provides a small amount of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) omega-6 and a very small amount of EPA. Nitzschia laevis does not produce DHA but provides small amounts of linoleic acid, in addition to EPA (98546, 98553, 98555).\n\nCommercial supplements providing fatty acids from algal oils generally dilute the oils in a vegetable oil, including high-oleic sunflower oil or olive oil. The resulting supplements provide 7.7 to 151.1 mg EPA/gram oil or 237.8-423.5 mg of DHA/gram oil (98545, 98555).\n\nSome types of algal oil also contain algae-specific polyphenols (98552). An algal oil from Nannochloropsis provides phytosterols, chlorophyll, lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, in addition to lipids (103314).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of EPA for the treatment and prevention of inflammation. EPA competes with arachidonic acid for inclusion in cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways (8696). This may have an anti-inflammatory effect in diseases such as psoriasis (1004). In human research, EPA has been shown to reduce markers of inflammation such as inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) (91409, 91411, 91413).\nAnticancer effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of DHA for the prevention of cancer. Although DHA is commonly taken to prevent certain types of cancer, the effects of DHA on cancer are unclear. Laboratory research suggests that cellular DHA metabolites may induce apoptosis of cancer cells (48074, 48206). However, the effect of algal oil on apoptosis is unclear.\nBlood and platelet effects\nSome algal oil is used as a source of EPA. In human research, EPA decreases platelet aggregation (9930, 90697). EPA also decreases blood viscosity (9930). However, eicosapentaenoic acid does not significantly affect clotting factors, fibrinogen concentrations, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or tissue plasminogen activator activity (10323).\nCardioprotective effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of DHA and EPA for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. DHA may reduce cardiovascular mortality risk by several mechanisms, including reducing blood lipids, blood coagulation, and blood pressure. However, DHA does not seem to decrease total cholesterol and it might actually increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (6143, 11111, 11112, 26466, 47944, 48055, 48083, 48092, 48174). The cardioprotective effects of EPA are likely related to its ability to incorporate into lipids and have anti-inflammatory effects (91411). EPA has also been shown to reduce serum triglyceride concentrations and increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (6143, 10321, 10322). However, in normolipidemic individuals, an algal oil enriched in EPA reduced levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol, but had no effect on triglyceride or LDL cholesterol levels (103314). Some types of algal oil are also used as a source of oleic acid. Oleic acid is a fatty acid found in relatively high levels in olive oil. In human research, olive oil seems to lower cardiovascular risk factors, including cholesterol levels, oxidation of LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure (2219, 2220, 2224, 8131, 10673).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn an animal gut dysbiosis model, DHA-enriched algal oil restored levels of some short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and promoted mucosal healing. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue were reduced (108153, 110377). In an obesity model, DHA-enriched algal oil modifies the gut microbiome, as well as its overall metabolic activity (110376).\nInfant development effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of DHA to supplement infant formula. DHA is thought to be important for normal neural function and might play a key role in the structural development of neural and synaptic membranes (424, 425, 8704, 8705).\nNeurologic effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of DHA and EPA to support normal neurological function. In human and animal research, DHA has neuroprotective effects (48054, 48187, 48278). DHA may protect nervous system functioning by altering membrane phospholipid fatty acid levels and having an effect on intracellular and intercellular signaling, membrane physical properties (such as fluidity, phase transition temperature, bilayer thickness, lateral domains, neurotransmission, membrane-bound enzyme and ion channel activities), and gene expression (48054). However, in children aged 7-12 years, taking algal oil rich in DHA had no effect on levels of serum neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, or adrenocorticotropic hormone (104560). Preliminary clinical research suggests that EPA might enhance the responsiveness of serotonin receptors (13762). Laboratory research suggests that EPA may prevent cell death and atrophy in the brain. Also, more general methods such as anti-inflammatory effects may play a role (66129).\nOcular effects\nAlgal oil is used as a source of DHA to support normal retinal function. Laboratory research suggests that the DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1 has anti-apoptotic effects in aging or degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptor cells (48124, 48182, 48196).\nWeight loss effects\nAlthough most clinical research shows that taking fish oil supplements is not effective for weight loss, this oil is of interest due to its constituent omega-3 fatty acids (15737, 66004, 89355, 89356, 100247, 100250, 106073). Also, taking fish oil has been shown to increase the resting metabolic rate in adults with overweight and obesity (107177). Algal oil is also of interest for obesity. Reduced body weight and/or fat gain has been shown in various animal obesity models given algal oils. In one such obesity model, the DHA-enriched Schizochytrium algal oil was as effective as fish oil and the weight loss medication Orlistat for reducing weight. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to changes in the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis. Algal oil also seems to modify the gut microbiome, as well as its overall metabolic activity (110376)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBurns. Preliminary clinical research in adults and children with second degree burns shows that applying a dressing containing olive oil, natural beeswax, and alkanna root extract to burn wounds once daily, usually starting within 24 hours of injury, improves healing compared with applying a dressing containing nitrofurazone and rifamycin every two days. Skin epithelization was initiated approximately 4 days earlier and mean hospital stay was about 6 days shorter for patients treated with the alkanna dressing compared with the control dressing. Pain was also reduced by approximately 14% (96328). The validity of these results is limited by a lack of appropriate randomization and blinding, which introduces the potential for bias.\nWound healing. Clinical research shows that applying alkanna root extract 20% ointment to the donor site after removal of a skin graft improves wound healing compared with applying base ointment alone.

Also, alkanna contains various pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), some of which are toxic. PAs are most concentrated in the plant roots, but may be found in all plant parts (12841, 12860).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlkanna contains alkannin, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in an animal model (12853).\nAntibacterial effects\nAlkanna is traditionally used for wound healing. One mechanism of action might be related to antimicrobial effects of alkanna. Alkanna has demonstrated antibacterial effects in vitro, including against multi-drug resistant pathogens (96328, 99906).\nHepatotoxic effects\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), constituents of alkanna, particularly unsaturated PAs, can cause hepatotoxicity. Cyclic diesters such as retrorsine and senecionine are the most hepatotoxic. Liver toxicity may result from PA-enhanced oxidative stress, but the exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown. Single doses of 10-20 mg PAs or chronic ingestion of amounts less than 10 mcg can cause veno-occlusive disease (12841, 12842).\nPneumotoxic effects\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), constituents of alkanna, are toxic to the lungs. In animals, pneumotoxicity occurs as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (12841, 12842).\nWound healing effects\nAlkanna is applied to the skin to promote wound healing. Possible mechanisms of action related to the wound healing effects of alkanna include antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Alkanna also stimulates skin epithelization rates in animal models. Alkannin and derivatives are the possible constituents of interest (12853, 96328, 99905, 99906)."

Ericifolin, a eugenol derivative, might be responsible for the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of allspice extract on prostate cancer cells (100057, 30644). The antioxidant effects of the constituent eugenol and other constituents in allspice essential oil might contribute to the anti-mutagenic and anti-cancer effects of allspice (12890, 100056). In breast cancer cells, a derivative of syzalterin might be the active apoptotic constituent in allspice leaf extract (100058).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, allspice leaf oil inhibits Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, B. megaterium, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium species (109923). The leaf oil also has bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumanii and eradicates its biofilm. It reduces biomass and cell viability by lysing bacterial cells and disrupting cell-to-cell connections in biofilms (109924).\nHormonal effects\nIn laboratory research, allspice leaf extract has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects related to binding of the estrogen receptor. Constituents of interest include a chromone, 6,8-di-C-methylcapillarisin, quercetin, and a derivative of syzalterin (30648, 100058).\nHypotensive effects\nIn animal research, allspice leaf extract had hypotensive properties when given intravenously (12891)."

            "Overview": "Aloe is a cactus-like plant that grows in hot, dry climates. In the United States, aloe is cultivated in Florida, Texas, and Arizona (90122). Aloe is in a plant family with over 360 species (12164). Materials derived from aloe are used commonly in cosmetics and as medicine (90122).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when aloe gel is used topically and appropriately. Aloe gel-containing formulations have been safely applied in clinical trials (101, 11982, 12096, 12098, 12159, 12160, 12163, 12164, 17418)(90123, 90124, 90127, 90128, 90129, 90131, 97320, 98816, 103305). When included in topical cosmetics, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that aloe-derived anthraquinone levels should not exceed 50 ppm (90122).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when aloe gel is used orally and appropriately, short-term. Aloe gel has been safely used in a dose up to 15 mL daily for up to 42 days or 100 mL of a 50% solution twice daily for up to 4 weeks (11984, 12164, 115043). Also, a specific aloe gel complex (Aloe QDM complex, Univera Inc.) has been safely used at a dose of approximately 600 mg daily for up to 8 weeks (90121). ...when aloe extract is used orally and appropriately, short-term. Aloe extract has been used with apparent safety in a dose of 500 mg daily for one month (101579). Also, an aloe extract enriched in aloe sterols has been used with apparent safety in a dose of 500 mg daily for 12 weeks (101577).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when aloe latex is used orally. There is some evidence that anthraquinones in aloe latex are carcinogenic or promote tumor growth, although data are conflicting (6138, 16387, 16388, 91596, 91597). In 2002, the US FDA banned the use of aloe latex in laxative products due to the lack of safety data (8229). ...when aloe whole-leaf extract is used orally. Aloe whole-leaf extract that has not been filtered over charcoal still contains anthraquinones. This type of aloe whole-leaf extract is referred to as being \"nondecolorized\". The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified this type of aloe whole-leaf extract as a possible human carcinogen (91598, 91908). Although filtering aloe whole-leaf extract over charcoal removes the anthraquinones, some animal research suggests that this filtered extract, which is referred to as being \"decolorized\", may still cause gene mutations (91598). This suggests that constituents besides anthraquinones may be responsible for the carcinogenicity of aloe whole-leaf extract. It should be noted that commercial products that contain aloe whole-leaf extract may be labeled as containing \"whole leaf Aloe vera juice\" or \"aloe juice\" (91908).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when aloe latex is used orally in high doses. Ingesting aloe latex 1 gram daily for several days can cause nephritis, acute kidney failure, and death (8, 8961).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when aloe gel is used topically and appropriately. Aloe gel-containing formulations have been safely applied in clinical trials (90124, 90131).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when aloe latex and aloe whole leaf extracts are used orally in children. Children younger than 12 years may experience abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea (4).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Anthraquinones present in aloe latex and aloe whole leaf extracts have irritant, cathartic, and possible mutagenic effects (4, 16387, 16388, 90122). There are also anecdotal reports and evidence from animal research that anthraquinones or aloe whole leaf extracts might induce abortion and stimulate menstruation; avoid using (4, 8, 19, 90122).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when aloe preparations are used orally. Cathartic and mutagenic anthraquinones present in aloe latex and aloe whole leaf extracts might pass into milk; avoid using (4, 19).",

However, oral aloe latex is associated with a greater risk of adverse effects, especially when used in high doses or long-term.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Aloe latex may cause abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea.\n\nTopically: Burning, erythema, and itching. Contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Aloe latex is associated with serious adverse effects when taken in high doses or long-term. Cases of acute hepatitis due to a hypersensitivity reaction to aloe leaf extract has been reported.\nDermatologic\nTopically, aloe gel has occasionally been associated with burning (12164, 19741, 30697, 30706), itching (12164, 19741, 30697), eczema (90122), erythema (19748, 30706, 90123), contact dermatitis (12163, 12164, 30695, 30736, 30737, 30738, 30740), popular eruption (30732), and urticaria (30712). Also, a case of generalized nummular and popular dermatitis attributed to hypersensitivity has been reported for a 47-year-old male who used aloe leaf gel, both topically and orally, for 4 years (30740).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case of severe hypokalemia has been reported for a male breast cancer patient who was undergoing chemotherapy and using aloe vera 1 liter daily orally for 2 weeks. The hypokalemia was attributed to the cathartic effects of aloe and resolved once aloe use was discontinued (30704).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, aloe latex can cause abdominal pain and cramps. Long-term use or abuse of aloe latex can cause diarrhea, sometimes with hypokalemia, albuminuria, hematuria, muscle weakness, weight loss, arrhythmia, and pseudomelanosis coli (pigment spots in intestinal mucosa). Pseudomelanosis coli is believed to be harmless, and usually reverses with discontinuation of aloe. It is not directly associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal adenoma or carcinoma (6138). Orally, aloe gel may cause nausea, stomach cramps, and other gastrointestinal complaints in some patients (104174, 111921, 111663).\n\nTopically, applying aloe gel in the mouth may cause nausea within 5 minutes of application in some patients (90124).\nless\nHematologic\nA case of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, characterized by abdominal pain, purpura, and severe arthralgia, has been reported in a 52-year-old male who drank aloe juice prepared from four to five leaflets for 10 days prior to symptom development (91598).\nless\nHepatic\nCases of acute hepatitis have been reported after ingestion of aloe leaf extracts for between 3 weeks and 5 years. This is thought to be a hypersensitivity reaction (15567, 15569, 16386, 17419, 90126, 91598). A case of acute hepatitis has also been reported for a 45-year-old female who drank two ounces of Euforia juice (Nuverus International), a product containing green tea, noni, goji, and aloe, daily for one month (90125). However, one small clinical trial in healthy individuals shows that taking aloe gel 2 ounces twice daily for 60 days does not impair liver function (104174).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, aloe latex can cause hemorrhagic gastritis, nephritis, and acute kidney failure following prolonged use of high doses (1 gram daily or more) (8961).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAcne. Topical aloe gel may reduce acne lesions when used with topical tretinoin in children and adults with acne.\nOne clinical trial in children and adults with acne shows that topical application of a gel containing aloe 50% in the morning and evening, in addition to topical application of tretinoin 0.025% cream and twice daily cleansing with a medical soap, improves acne lesions by approximately 35% more than using the same treatments without aloe (90124).\nless\nBurns. Topical aloe gel or cream may reduce healing time in patients with superficial or partial thickness burns.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with second-degree burns shows that use of topical aloe vera reduces time to healing by about 4.4 days when compared to control groups treated with silvadene, silver sulfadiazine, or gauze containing 0.5% chlorhexidine acetate (110209). Most clinical research shows that applying aloe gel or cream topically up to twice daily reduces healing time when compared with silver sulfadiazine (19771, 110210, 110212), framycetin (19775), vaseline gauze (19773), or placebo (101, 97320) in patients with superficial or partial thickness burns. Topical application of aloe cream up to twice daily might also decrease wound size when compared with silver sulfadiazine and framycetin (19771, 19775). In addition, some clinical research in patients with burns caused by sulfur mustard shows that applying cream containing aloe and olive oil twice daily for 6 weeks improves pruritus similarly to betamethasone 0.1% cream and may lead to further reductions in excoriation and fissure (19768). However, some preliminary clinical research shows that applying fresh aloe mucilage or aloe extract daily is no more effective than silver sulfadiazine for reducing wound healing time in patients with superficial or partial thickness burns (19774, 19776).\nless\nConstipation. Oral aloe latex may improve symptoms in patients with constipation; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of aloe latex as a laxative due to safety concerns.\nTaking aloe latex 100-200 mg daily or aloe extract 50 mg as a stimulant laxative seems to relieve constipation due to the cathartic effects of the anthraquinones in the aloe (4, 5, 8). Taking 1-3 capsules of a formulation containing aloe 150 mg, celandine 300 mg, and psyllium 50 mg also seems to improve stool consistency and the mean number of stools in patients with chronic constipation when compared with placebo (19747). However, in 2002, the U.S. FDA banned the use of aloe latex for constipation due to safety concerns (8229, 8443).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral aloe may reduce blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with diabetes. It may be most effective in patients with fasting blood glucose levels of 200 mg/dL or greater.\nMost clinical research in adults with prediabetes and diabetes shows that taking aloe vera orally can reduce fasting blood glucose by 30-47 mg/dL and HbA1c by 0.41% to 1% (12164, 17488, 17489, 19756, 95943, 95945, 95946). One meta-analysis of 92 patients shows that aloe vera is associated with a larger overall reduction of fasting blood glucose in those with a baseline fasting blood glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (95945). Another meta-analysis of 206 patients shows that aloe vera increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and reduces triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels when compared with placebo in adults with prediabetes and untreated diabetes (95943). These analyses include studies that used multiple forms of aloe vera, including gel powder, extract, raw crushed leaves, and fresh extracted juice, as well as multiple doses ranging from 100-1000 mg of powder and 15-150 mL of juice taken for durations ranging from 4-14 weeks. Significant heterogeneity between studies, small sample sizes, and wide variability in the form and dose of aloe used limit the validity of these findings and the ability to identify an effective dose (95943, 95945, 95946).\n\nAdditionally, some research has shown no benefit. This may be due to the different forms and doses of aloe used. One clinical study shows that taking aloe gel as 15 mL twice daily or taking aloe juice 15 mL twice daily does not decrease glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (17420). Other clinical research shows that taking a specific aloe gel complex (Aloe QDM complex, Univera Inc.) containing processed aloe gel 147 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect glycemic indices when compared with placebo in patients with diabetes or prediabetes (90121).\nless\nGenital herpes. Topical aloe extract cream may improve healing of genital herpes lesions.\nClinical research in males with genital herpes shows that applying a cream containing aloe extract 0.5% three times daily, 5 days weekly, for up to 2 weeks increases healing rates when compared with aloe gel or placebo. The mean time to healing after application of the aloe extract was 5 days, compared with 12 days with placebo (12164, 19745, 19746).\nless\nLichen planus. Rinsing the mouth with aloe-containing mouthwash or applying aloe gel to the mouth or vulva may reduce symptoms and improve lesion healing in patients with lichen planus.\nClinical research in patients with oral lichen planus shows that using 0.4 mL of mouthwash containing aloe gel 70% three times daily for 12 weeks or applying a gel containing aloe mucilage 70% twice daily for 8 weeks is up to 6 times more likely to reduce pain when compared with placebo (19762, 19763, 19764). However, these findings are questionable due to poor study design. Other clinical research in patients with oral lichen planus shows that using 2 tablespoons of aloe-containing mouthwash four times daily for a month, or applying aloe gel three times daily for 8 weeks, reduces pain and improves lesion healing at least as much as triamcinolone acetonide paste (0.1% in one study) (19765, 90130). However, aloe gel may not be as beneficial as laser therapy. A clinical study in patients with lichen planus show that applying a gel containing aloe powder 500 mg to the affected site three times daily for 2 months is less effective for improving pain and lesion healing than receiving low-level laser therapy twice weekly for 2 months. However, no between-group differences were maintained at 7 months after treatment completion (108722).\n\nAloe has also been compared to other herbal ingredients. A small clinical study conducted in India in patients with oral lichen planus shows that applying aloe, ashwagandha, or turmeric twice daily for 4 months reduces lesion size, burning, and pain when compared to baseline. Additionally, aloe reduces these outcomes similarly to topical ashwagandha or turmeric (115931). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparison to placebo or standard of care.\n\nAdditionally, a network meta-analysis of 2 small clinical trials shows that applying aloe trails only purslane of the herbal agents studied with regard to clinical improvement as measured by the Thongprasom scale. However, aloe does not seem to improve complete clinical resolution, clinical scores, or pain (111640).\n\nIn patients with vulval lichen planus, clinical research shows that topical application with aloe gel twice daily for 8 weeks increases the number of patients who experience clinical improvement of at least 50% when compared with placebo (19766).\nless\nObesity. Oral aloe gel may modestly reduce body weight and fat mass in adults who are overweight or obese.\nOne clinical trial in overweight and obese adults with diabetes or prediabetes shows that taking a specific aloe gel complex (Aloe QDM complex, Univera Inc.) containing processed aloe gel 147 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight by 0.6 kg and fat mass by 1 kg when compared with placebo (90121).\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. Topical aloe may reduce burning sensations in patients with oral submucous fibrosis, but it may not improve mouth opening, tongue protrusion, or cheek flexibility in these patients.\nA meta-analysis of five small clinical studies in patients with oral submucous fibrosis shows that topical application of aloe gel for 3 months reduces burning sensation, possibly for up to two months after treatment, when compared with placebo or active control. A network meta-analysis also found that aloe is most effective in reducing burning sensation, ranked only after treatment with corticosteroids, hyaluronidase, and antioxidants (113514). However, aloe does not seem to improve mouth opening, tongue protrusion, or cheek flexibility (100256). One of the studies included in the analysis used a specific aloe gel (Sheetal lab Surat) 5 mg applied topically on each side of the buccal mucosa three times daily for 3 months (90131). All of the studies included in the analysis were conducted in India, so it is unclear if the results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\n\nLimited research has also evaluated the use of topical and oral aloe vera in combination. A small clinical study shows that consuming pure aloe vera juice (Hamant Sai, Sun Vision Company) 30 mL twice daily and applying pure aloe vera gel (Hamant Sai, Sun Vision Company) three times daily for 3 months improves cheek flexibility and tongue protrusion when compared with a treatment regimen consisting of intralesional injections of hydrocortisone acetate 25 mg and hyaluronidase 1500 IU weekly for 6 weeks and supplementation with Cap SM Fibro (Indoco Remedies) twice daily for 3 months. Both treatment regimens show an improvement in mouth opening and burning sensation when compared to baseline, with the aloe vera treatment producing a more rapid improvement in burning sensation (95944). It is not clear how this combination of oral and topical aloe vera compares with topical aloe vera alone.\nless\nPsoriasis. Topical aloe extract cream may reduce erythema and scaling and improve the resolution of psoriatic plaques in patients with psoriasis. Limited research suggests that topical aloe gel does not have the same effects.\nApplying aloe extract 0.5% cream topically three times daily for 4 weeks significantly improves and increases the resolution of psoriatic plaques when compared with placebo (101, 12096, 12164). Aloe extract cream also seems to reduce desquamation, erythema, and infiltration (12096). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying cream containing aloe mucilage 70% twice daily for 8 weeks improves psoriasis severity more effectively than triamcinolone 0.1% cream, although both treatments had similar effects on dermatology-specific quality of life (19741). Treatment with aloe gel does not seem to improve erythema, infiltration, and desquamation associated with psoriasis when compared with placebo (19748).\nless\nTraumatic oral ulcers. Topical aloe gel may prevent oral ulcers after application of orthodontic appliances in adolescents and adults.\nClinical research in patients aged 12 years and older shows that applying a gel containing aloe 80% to the gums twice daily for one month after the cementation of orthodontic appliances prevents the development of mouth ulcers when compared with a chlorhexidine gel. Ulcers occurred in about 6% of patients using the aloe gel compared with 81% of those using the chlorhexidine gel. Bleeding and inflammation were also reduced (103305).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlveolar osteitis. It is unclear if topical aloe or the aloe constituent acemannan is beneficial in patients with alveolar osteitis.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with alveolar osteitis shows that applying a patch containing the aloe constituent acemannan (SaliCept patch) to the tooth socket, once after curettage and irrigation and again 3 days later, reduces pain intensity and improves clinical symptoms when compared with curettage and irrigation alone (19754).\nless\nAmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nAnal fissures. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial in patients with anal fissures.\nOne small clinical study in patients with chronic anal fissures shows that applying an aloe cream containing 0.5% powdered spray-dried inner aloe leaf juice (Zarban Phyto-Pharmaceutical Co) three times daily for at least 3 weeks, as an adjuvant to sitz baths three times daily, using a laxative, and eating a full fiber diet, improves pain, wound healing, and bleeding severity when compared with placebo (90129).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that application of a specific combination cream (Olivederma, Kimi Daru Pharmaceutical Co.) containing aloe gel and virgin olive oil twice daily for 6 weeks improves disease severity and quality of life when compared with betamethasone cream (105020). It is unclear if this effect is due to aloe, olive oil, or the combination.\nless\nBreast engorgement. It is unclear if topical aloe improves lactation-associated breast pain.\nMeta-analyses of 4-5 clinical trials in lactating patients show that use of topical aloe modestly reduces nipple/breast pain and irritation when compared with no treatment, routine care with topical breast milk or breast massage, or treatment with lanolin (110213). However, studies included in this analysis were not specific to breast engorgement.\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial in patients with burning mouth syndrome.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with chronic burning mouth syndrome shows that applying 0.5 mL of aloe 70% gel to sore areas on the tongue three times daily prior to wearing a tongue protector for 12 weeks does not improve pain or symptoms when compared with placebo gel or using the tongue protector alone in patients with chronic burning mouth syndrome (90127). However, differences in baseline pain ratings between study groups limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nCancer. Oral aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with lung cancer shows that, when administered with standard chemotherapy, three daily doses of 10 mL of a mixture consisting of fresh aloe leaves 300 grams plus honey 500 grams dissolved in 40 mL of alcohol 40% increases the rate of complete response, partial response, or disease control when compared with chemotherapy alone (19752).\nless\nCanker sores. Small clinical studies suggest that applying the aloe constituent acemannan to cancer sores may reduce ulcer size, but not pain. However, the effect of aloe is unclear.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that topical aloe is no more effective than control interventions for reducing the size and pain of oral ulcers (110216). Control interventions have included carrier gel or triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (19751, 110216). However, a recent clinical trial shows that topical aloe gel (G.U.M Canker-X, Sunstar Americas, Schaumburg, USA) after meals and before bedtime for 5 days is more effective than amlexanox 5% paste and placebo for reducing pain and the size of canker sores in patients with recurrent symptoms (110215). Other small clinical trials have investigated the effects of fermented aloe or the aloe constituent acemannan. One small clinical trial in adults with recurrent canker sores shows that applying a fermented aloe gel to oral ulcers three times daily seems to accelerate healing time when compared with chitosan gel (104173). Another small clinical trial in patients with canker sores shows that using a wound dressing containing the aloe constituent acemannan (Carrisyn Gel Wound Dressing) shortens the average healing time of canker sores when compared with an oral analgesic (Orabase-Plain) (19750). Other clinical research shows that applying acemannan 0.5% in Carbopol 934P NF three times daily for 7 days reduces ulcer size, but not pain, when compared with Carbopol 934P NF alone in patients with canker sores (90123). However, applying triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% appears to be more effective in reducing pain and similarly effective in reducing ulcer size when compared with acemannan 0.5% (90123).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial for the prevention or treatment chemotherapy-induced acral erythema.\nA small, single-blind clinical study in adults with cancer taking capecitabine, either alone or in combination with other chemotherapy treatments, shows that applying aloe vera gel 87.4% followed by urea cream 10% twice daily reduces the incidence of grade 2-3 acral erythema to 13.3%, compared to a rate of 35.5% in those using urea cream alone. However, there was no difference in quality of life between groups (115042).\nless\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nDental plaque. Using aloe-containing toothpaste may reduce dental plaque in adults; however, it is unclear if this is more effective than fluoride-containing toothpaste. Rinsing with an aloe-containing mouthwash may reduce dental plaque in children.\nOne small clinical trial in adults shows that brushing teeth with a dentifrice containing aloe gel (Forever Bright, Forever Living Products) three times daily for 30 days does not reduce the occurrence of plaque better than a fluoridated dentifrice (Sorriso Dentes Brancos, Kolynos do Brasil), although both treatments seem to show improvement when compared to baseline (19755). Another small clinical study in adults with gingivitis shows that using toothpaste containing aloe daily for 24 weeks reduces plaque more effectively than placebo or triclosan-containing toothpaste (19760). In children aged 8-14 years with mild plaque, using a mouth wash containing aloe vera 7% twice daily for 4 weeks reduced plaque by a large amount when compared with placebo. In addition, it was as effective as chlorhexidine 0.2% (103306).\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear whether topical aloe is beneficial for patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with a stage 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcer who are receiving oral antibiotics shows that applying a topical product containing aloe and great plantain twice daily for 4 weeks reduces ulcer surface area and time to healing, but not ulcer depth, when compared with antibiotics alone (97323). The effect of applying aloe gel alone without concomitant oral antibiotic therapy is unknown.\nless\nDiaper rash. Topical aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial shows that applying a cream containing aloe gel and olive oil three times daily for 5-10 days reduces diaper rash severity in children less than 3 years of age when compared to baseline; however, it does not seem to be as effective as calendula ointment (19779). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing with an aloe-containing mouthwash is beneficial for dry mouth.\nIn patients with dry mouth related to type 2 diabetes, clinical research shows that an aloe vera 50% mouthwash, as 20 mL swished and spit three times daily for 14 days, modestly reduces symptoms of dry mouth when compared with rinsing with a saline control mouthwash (106068). The validity of this study is limited due to unclear reporting.\nless\nDry skin. Topical aloe or oral aloe sterols may improve some measures of dry skin. However, findings are mixed due to the use of varied formulations and doses.\nOne small clinical trial shows that applying a cream containing freeze-dried aloe extract 0.1% to 0.5% to the skin for 2 weeks increases the amount of water in the stratum corneum, but does not reduce transepidermal water loss, when compared with placebo (19758). Another small clinical study in females with occupational dry skin shows that wearing gloves coated in aloe 8 hours daily for 30 days improves symptoms of dry skin when compared with no treatment (19759). However, it is not clear if the benefits resulted from applying aloe or wearing gloves. One small clinical trial in healthy females shows that consumption of a yogurt containing 500 mg of aloe vera gel powder (0.4 mg of aloe sterol) daily for 12 weeks increases skin hydration, skin elasticity, and collagen content of the dermis while reducing markers of skin fatigue and transepidermal water loss when compared with placebo (95942). However, another study in healthy females shows that taking aloe sterol-enriched aloe extract 0.5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve skin hydration when compared with placebo, although redness, itching, collagen content, and transepidermal water loss were improved (101577).\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nFrostbite. Although there has been interest in using topical aloe for frostbite, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if taking aloe vera gel reduces symptoms of GERD.\nA small, open-label clinical study in adults in Iran with GERD shows that taking aloe vera gel syrup 10 mL daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of GERD when compared to baseline, but is less effective than treatment with omeprazole 20 mg or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (115043). The validity of this study was limited by the lack of blinding.\nless\nGingivitis. Using aloe-containing toothpaste or mouthwash may reduce gingivitis in adults, but it does not seem to be more effective than fluoride-containing toothpaste or chlorhexidine mouthwash. Rinsing with an aloe-containing mouthwash may reduce gingivitis in children.\nOne small clinical trial in adults shows that brushing teeth with a dentifrice containing aloe gel (Forever Bright, Forever Living Products) three times daily for 30 days does not reduce the occurrence of gingivitis more effectively than a fluoridated dentifrice (Sorriso Dentes Brancos, Kolynos do Brasil), although both treatments seem to show improvement when compared to baseline (19755). Another small clinical study in adults with gingivitis shows that using aloe-containing toothpaste daily for 24 weeks reduces gingivitis more effectively than placebo, but not more than triclosan-containing toothpaste (19760). A very small clinical study in adults with chronic gingivitis shows that rinsing with aloe-containing mouthwash twice daily for 28 days improves marginal plaque index and bleeding on interdental brushing when compared to baseline, but not when compared with chlorhexidine mouthwash (115021).\n\nIn children aged 8-14 years with mild gingivitis, using a mouthwash containing aloe vera 7% twice daily for 4 weeks reduced gingivitis by a large amount when compared with placebo. In addition, it was as effective as chlorhexidine 0.2% (103306).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral aloe is beneficial in patients with systolic heart failure.\nA very small clinical study in adults with moderate to moderately severe chronic systolic heart failure shows that taking aloe vera gel capsules 150 mg twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard treatment decreases New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, improves Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) total, physical, emotional, and social scores, and enhances sleep quality but does not reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea scores or improve six-minute walk test distance when compared with placebo (111663). The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, the validity of these effects may be limited by the small sample size.\nless\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Oral and topical aloe have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows that treatment with colostrum and aloe orally (Remargin Colostrum Gastro-Gel, Solimè srl, Cavriago, Reggio Emilia, Italy) and as a mouthwash (Remargin Colostrum OS, Solimè srl, Cavriago, Reggio Emilia, Italy) modestly reduces the risk and duration of severe oral mucositis and febrile neutropenia when compared with historical values. There was no effect on the duration of neutropenia, the length of hospital stay, pain, or duration of medications. All patients were also given standard care. The mouthwash was used after each oral hygiene, and the oral treatment was 3 to 5 times daily depending on symptoms (110211).\nless\nHepatitis. It is unclear if oral aloe is beneficial in patients with hepatitis.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with liver fibrosis primarily caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C shows that taking a high molecular weight fraction of aloe 0.05 grams three times daily for 12 weeks reduces fibrosis, attenuates liver enzyme activity, and decreases hepatic glutathione content when compared with placebo (19780).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Small clinical studies suggest that oral aloe or the aloe constituent acemannan may not improve CD4 counts or viral load in patients with HIV.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with HIV shows that taking the aloe constituent, acemannan, 400 mg four times daily does not significantly improve CD4 counts, ratio of CD4 to CD8, or viral load when compared with placebo (19851). Another small clinical study in patients with HIV shows that taking aloe gruel 30-40 mL daily does not improve CD4 counts when compared with those treated with antiretroviral therapy, although both groups show similar increases in weight compared to baseline (19852).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nHypertrophic scars. Topical aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients undergoing median sternotomy shows that applying a silicone gel containing aloe extract and other herbal extracts (Bangkok Botanica) to postoperative hypertrophic scars for 6 months reduces the height of the scar and improves pliability by a moderate amount when compared with a silicone placebo gel. There was no effect on pigmentation or vascularity (102793). It is unknown whether any benefit is related to aloe, other ingredients, or their combination.\nless\nInfluenza. Oral aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination supplement containing aloe vera gel, rosemary, and poria mushrooms twice daily 28 days before administering the influenza vaccine and 28 days after vaccination does not improve immunologic markers or reduce symptom severity, symptom duration, frequency of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, or the use of cold and flu medications when compared with placebo (111921).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral aloe extract or juice may not improve symptoms in patients with IBS.\nMost research suggests that aloe is not effective for improving symptoms of IBS; however, the available evidence is of low-quality, with some studies having high dropout rates or inadequate power to detect significant differences. Two clinical trials show that taking a specific aloe extract (AVH200, Calmino Group AB) 250-500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve IBS-related symptoms or response rates when compared with placebo (101579, 104169), although one of these studies did find a trend toward a higher response rate, defined as a 50% or greater improvement in symptom scores, with aloe over placebo (104169). Also, a pooled analysis of these two studies shows that taking this specific product improves IBS-related pain severity and frequency in patients with diarrhea-prominent IBS (IBS-D) when compared with placebo, but does not seem to improve stool consistency or frequency (108718). Clinical trials evaluating aloe juice 50 mL four times daily for 1 month or 60 mL twice daily for 5 months show no significant improvement in quality of life scores or IBS symptoms when compared with placebo (104170, 104171), although one study did find a trend toward improved response in patients with IBS-D (104171). Despite a lack of significant findings in the individual studies, a pooled analysis of the two smallest studies above (104169, 104171) shows that aloe extract or juice, taken for 4 weeks, may increase the rate of symptom response by almost 70% when compared with placebo (103307).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nNipple fissures. It is unclear if application of an aloe poultice improves nipple-related complications of breastfeeding, such as nipple fissures.\nA clinical study in females who have just given birth and are breastfeeding for the first time shows that applying a poultice containing aloe gel to the nipples after breastfeeding six times daily for 5 days improves nipple eschar when compared with no treatment. Although there were modest improvements in other outcomes, such as redness, fissures, and epidermolysis, these differences were not significant (108721). Participants were instructed to clean with purified water before the next breastfeeding session.\nless\nOral mucositis. Oral aloe juice or application of aloe solution inside the mouth may reduce the severity of oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation.\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials shows that oral application of an aloe-containing product 2 to 4 times daily during chemotherapy or radiation reduces the odds of developing more severe mucositis (grade 3 or 4) by 68% compared to control (i.e., placebo, benzydamine, or sodium bicarbonate). However, subgroup analysis only shows a benefit with aloe in comparison with placebo (117144). The validity of these findings is limited by the variety of aloe formulations and regimens used and the overall lower quality of the included studies.\n\nClinical research, some of which is included in the analysis above, shows that drinking 15 mL of juice, containing aloe 80%, 3 times daily during radiation therapy decreases the risk of developing moderate or severe mucositis when compared with placebo (19767, 19964).\n\nIn addition, in children aged 3-6 years undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, application of a solution containing aloe 70% twice daily inside the mouth, starting three days before chemotherapy, reduces the severity of oral mucositis and delays its onset by 2 weeks when compared with sodium bicarbonate 5% (103304). Other clinical research in adults with head and neck cancer shows that rinsing and then swallowing 20 mL of a solution containing aloe juice 94.5% four times daily throughout the course of radiation therapy does not prevent mucositis when compared with placebo (19963). However, this study was not adequately powered to detect significant differences between study groups.\n\nAloe has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of oral mucositis. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows that treatment with colostrum and aloe orally (Remargin Colostrum Gastro-Gel, Solimè srl, Cavriago, Reggio Emilia, Italy) and as a mouthwash (Remargin Colostrum OS, Solimè srl, Cavriago, Reggio Emilia, Italy) modestly reduces the risk and duration of severe oral mucositis when compared with historical values. There was no effect on overall risk or time of onset of mucositis. All patients were also given standard care. The mouthwash was used after each oral hygiene, and the oral treatment was 3 to 5 times daily depending on symptoms (110211). Another small clinical study in adults with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy shows that rinsing with 5 mL of a mouthwash containing aloe, German chamomile, peppermint oil, and honey 3 times daily for 60 seconds for 6 weeks starting on the first day of radiotherapy reduces oral mucositis incidence, severity, and pain when compared with chlorhexidine and placebo (111291). It is unclear if these findings are due to aloe, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral and topical aloe for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral aloe for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if application of aloe inside the mouth is beneficial for chronic periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that using various aloe-containing gels, mouthwashes, and toothpastes improves plaque index when compared with placebo or other treatments (i.e., chlorhexidine rinse, metformin, and tea tree oil). The effect of these aloe products on gingival index could not be determined (108719). The validity of this finding is limited by the variety of aloe formulations and comparators used in the included studies.\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of pressure ulcers.\nOne small clinical study shows that applying a gel containing the aloe constituent acemannan to pressure ulcers daily for 10 weeks does not reduce the time to healing when compared with management with moist saline gauze (12160, 19853). Another small clinical study conducted in Iran in patients with category II pressure ulcers shows that applying topical aloe vera gel after cleaning with normal saline and prior to dressing daily for 15 days reduces pain during dressing changes when compared with normal saline dressing (113672). Other clinical research shows that cleansing wounds with a saline spray containing aloe, silver chloride, and decyl glucoside for 2 weeks improves pressure ulcer healing when compared with isotonic saline spray (19854). It is unclear if this improvement is due to aloe, other ingredients, or the combination in the spray.\n\nAloe has also been evaluated for the prevention of pressure ulcers. A small clinical study in hospitalized patients in an orthopedic ward shows that applying aloe vera gel to the hips, sacrum, and heels twice daily for 10 days reduces pressure ulcer occurrence to 3 of 39 patients, compared to 12 of 38 patients of those receiving placebo (98816). However, methodological limitations with this study, including differences in how the gels were applied, limit the reliability of these results. A clinical study in hospitalized patients receiving intensive care has evaluated either aloe gel 94%, olive oil 100%, or a compounded product containing aloe vera and olive oil in a 3:2 ratio, applied to pressure areas as 10-15 mL every 8 hours. At the end of 30 days, pressure ulcers occurred in 17% of patients receiving the combination product, 20% receiving olive oil, 33% receiving aloe gel, and 37% receiving standard care, suggesting that any benefit may be due to olive oil (108723).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of topical aloe gel for preventing or delaying dermatitis in patients undergoing radiation therapy. These conflicting findings may be due to differences in study designs, products used, and application practices.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical trials, some of which overlap, in patients with various types of cancer shows that topical aloe does not reduce the incidence or severity of radiation dermatitis (110325, 113674) and does not reduce the incidence of erythema, pruritis, moist desquamation, or dry desquamation when compared with control (110325). However, the included studies are limited by a lack of blinding, questionable methodological quality, and a high risk of bias. In contrast, another meta-analysis of generally poor quality randomized controlled trials shows that topical pre-treatment application with aloe as gel, cream, lotion, or fresh plant reduces the risk of radiation dermatitis by 23%, especially mild to moderate radiation dermatitis, when compared with a control group not treated with aloe (110214). One U.S. study included in the analysis shows that applying aloe 98% gel twice daily starting within three days of radiation initiation does not reduce radiation dermatitis when compared with a placebo gel or no treatment (12163).\n\nOther research has focused on specific side effects. One clinical trial shows that applying aloe 98% gel three times daily throughout radiation treatment and after treatment does not seem to reduce symptoms of radiation dermatitis in patients being treated for breast cancer (12098). Some research shows that applying aloe 100% gel 6-8 times daily might prolong the time before radiation-related side effects occur, but only when the cumulative dose of radiation is high (>2,700 cGy) (12159). In addition, applying aloe-based gel once daily after radiation treatment is less effective than applying anionic phospholipid-based cream for reducing dryness, erythema, and peeling in children being treated for Hodgkin disease (19855).\n\nAloe has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small cohort study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy shows that applying aloe 2% and radish 4% gel twice daily until ten days after the last radiotherapy session prevents radiation dermatitis as shown by fewer cases of radiation dermatitis in the 10th, 30th, and 35th radiation sessions when compared with placebo. Furthermore, after the 35th session, the subjects prophylactically treated with the aloe and radish gel had milder grades of radiation dermatitis when compared with control (111662). A preliminary clinical study shows that applying a specific cream product (Radioskin 2, Herbalab di Perazza Massimiliano Company), which contains aloe, ginkgo extract, and metal esculetina, along with another specific cream product (Radioskin 1, Herbalab di Perazza Massimiliano Company), which contains alga atlantica and ethylbisiminomethylguaicolo manganese cloruro, may improve skin hydration and reduce skin toxicity associated with radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer (89727). These creams were applied topically 2-3 times daily at least 3 hours before and after radiation treatment, from 15 days prior to radiation until one month after completion.\nless\nRadiation proctopathy. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of radiation proctopathy.\nOne very small clinical study in females with radiation proctopathy shows that applying 1 gram of an ointment containing aloe vera 3% rectally twice daily in conjunction with taking sulfasalazine 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces diarrhea, fecal urgency, radiation toxicity, and clinical symptoms when compared with sulfasalazine alone (95941).\n\nThis same product, applied twice daily for 6 weeks starting on the first day of radiotherapy, has also been evaluated for the prevention of radiation proctopathy. One small clinical study in patients with pelvic cancer shows that applying this ointment prevents proctopathy-related diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and fecal urgency when compared with placebo. Proctopathy-related symptoms occurred in 5% of patients using aloe, compared with 65% of those using placebo. However, there was no difference in rectal pain, constipation, or symptoms of cystitis between groups (101578). A very small clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer shows that applying this ointment prevents proctopathy-related diarrhea and reduces proctopathy severity, but does not improve rectal bleeding, rectal pain, fecal urgency, or symptoms of cystitis, when compared with placebo (108717). Reasons for discrepancies are unclear but might relate to differences in cancer diagnosis and radiation regimens.\nless\nScabies. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial in patients with scabies.\nOne small open-label clinical study in children and adults with scabies shows that application of crude aloe gel for 3 consecutive days, repeated again after one week, may reduce itching and lesions similar to benzyl benzoate lotion in patients with scabies when compared to baseline (19769). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nSeborrheic dermatitis. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial in patients with seborrheic dermatitis.\nOne small clinical study in adults with seborrheic dermatitis shows that applying aloe 30% emulsion twice daily for 4-6 weeks reduces scaling, itching, and the number of sites involved, but not erythema, when compared with placebo (19749).\nless\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical aloe is effective for the prevention or treatment of stretch marks.\nOne small clinical trial in nulliparous patients shows that topical application of a cream containing aloe twice daily, starting at gestational week 16-18, reduces erythema and itching related to abdominal stretch marks, but does not seem to decrease the number of stretch marks, when compared with a base cream (97322). Aloe gel has also been evaluated in combination with fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser treatments. A small clinical trial shows that applying a gel containing aloe 87.4% twice daily for up to one month after each of three CO2 laser treatments improves the texture of the skin for up to 6 months after the last laser treatment when compared to baseline. This was as effective as topical recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) and CO2 laser treatments. However, when specific sites were examined, only the texture of stretch marks on the buttocks were improved, and these improvements were less than those seen with rhEGF (101580). The effect of aloe for the prevention of stretch marks is unknown.\nless\nSunburn. Although there has been interest in using topical aloe for sunburn, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nTungiasis. Topical aloe has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study shows that applying a product containing coconut oil, jojoba oil, and aloe leaf extract (Zanzarin, Engelhard Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG) to the feet twice daily for one-week intervals seems to reduce the number of embedded sandfleas in individuals with tungiasis when compared with a control group (19778). It is not clear if this effect is due to aloe, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral aloe gel is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking aloe gel for 4 weeks, starting at 25-50 mL twice daily for the first 3 days and increasing to 100 mL twice daily thereafter, reduces symptoms when compared with placebo (11984).\nless\nVaginitis. It is unclear if topical aloe is beneficial for vaginitis.\nOne small clinical trial in postmenopausal patients with atrophic vaginitis shows that applying 5 mg of a vaginal cream containing aloe gel 2% nightly for 2 weeks, then 3 nights per week for 4 weeks, reduces vaginal dryness, burning, and pain during intercourse and improves measures of vaginal health and maturity when compared to baseline.

Although there has been interest in using oral and topical aloe for varicose veins, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of aloe for this purpose.\nWound healing. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of topical aloe products for improving wound healing. These conflicting findings may be due to differences in study designs, products used, and application practices.\nOne small clinical study shows that applying aloe gel to a caesarean wound after surgery, followed by a dry gauze, improves wound healing over the first 24 hours when compared with the dry gauze alone (90128). However, other clinical research in a small number of patients undergoing gynecologic surgery or cesarean section shows that applying an aloe gel extract (Carrington Dermal Wound Gel) to surgical wounds may actually delay wound healing (11982). Another small clinical trial shows that applying a formulation of aloe gel 0.5% cream (Zarband, Phytopharmaceutical Co.) to hemorrhoidectomy wounds three times daily for 4 weeks improves healing rates and pain relief scores and decreases intake of narcotic analgesics when compared with placebo (17418). However, another clinical trial in patients with biopsy wounds shows that application of a hydrogel containing the aloe constituent, acemannan (Carrasyn, Carrington hydrogel), does not improve wound epithelialization, wound infections, or pain when compared with conventional therapy (19856).\n\nAdditionally, there is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of aloe for improving skin graft donor site healing. One small clinical study shows that applying aloe gel 87.4% daily to split-thickness skin graft donor sites reduces time to complete healing by about 2 days when compared with placebo (97320). However, another small clinical study shows that applying aloe cream three times daily to split-thickness skin graft donor sites does not improve healing time when compared with placebo (97321).\nless\nWrinkled skin.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of aloe.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of aloe is the leaf. From the leaf, multiple components of aloe can be extracted. Most aloe-containing products use aloe gel or aloe latex. The forms of aloe contain different active constituents and have different pharmacological effects. Aloe gel is the clear, jelly-like substance obtained from the thin-walled mucilaginous cells in the center of the leaf (8224, 12164). This form of aloe is often found in topical formulations and in cosmetics. Aloe latex is an intensely bitter, yellow sap or juice produced in the peripheral bundle sheath cells just beneath the leaf skin (12164). It drains from cut leaves and dries to form solid granules, sometimes referred to as \"aloes.\" References to aloe juice or aloe sap are usually describing aloe latex products. Some products contain a homogenized total leaf extract which contains constituents of both the gel and the latex (8224, 12164).\n\nAloe latex contains up to 30% anthraquinones, including glycosides such as barbaloin (aloin), isobarbaloin, and emodin; and free anthraquinones (aglycones) such as aloe-emodin, anthranol, and chrysophanic acid (12164). It also contains resins and aloesin. Aloe gel does not contain the anthraquinones found in aloe latex. Aloe gel contains mono- and poly-saccharides, including acemannan, aloeride, and maloyl glucans; tannins; sterols; enzymes, including cyclooxygenase, amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, and carboxypeptidase; amino acids; saponins; salicylic acid; arachidonic acid; lipids; vitamins; and minerals (4, 12164, 30686, 90122). Sterols in aloe include lophenol, 24-methyl-lophenol, 24-ethyl-lophenol, cycloartenol, and 24-methylene-cycloartanol (101577).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nConstituents in aloe may play a role in the reduction of pain and itching associated with inflammation, as shown in laboratory research. In laboratory research, the carboxypeptidase and salicylate components of aloe gel were shown to inhibit bradykinin, a pain-producing agent. Magnesium lactate present can inhibit histamine, which may reduce itching (101). A C-glucosyl chromone component appears to reduce topical inflammation (8223). In colorectal mucosa in vitro, aloe gel has an antioxidant effect, decreasing levels of colorectal prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8. These effects may explain why aloe gel seems to help some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (12158). Salicylic acid and other antiprostaglandin compounds in aloe may be responsible for aloe's local anti-inflammatory activity, possibly due to an inhibitory effect on the arachidonic acid pathway via cyclooxygenase (30747). In vitro, the maloyl glucan components of aloe also had anti-inflammatory effects (30686).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAloe gel seems to have both antibacterial and antifungal properties (101, 30692, 103306). In animal research, a combination of honey and aloe gel protected against burn wound infection (30707).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of aloe may play a role in its anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, and wound healing effects. Antioxidant effects of aloe pulp have been demonstrated in animal models (30667) and the properties have been attributed to aloesin derivatives and glycoprotein constituents (30671, 30672, 30682).\nCancer effects\nPreliminary data suggest that anthraquinones may have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects, and may promote tumor growth, although some data are conflicting (6138, 16387, 16388). Possible mechanisms include intercalation of the tricyclic anthraquinone structure into DNA, inhibition of topoisomerase II, and induction of cell signaling and growth (16387, 16388). Also, the constituent aloe-emodin is thought to induce DNA damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (30684).\n\nHowever, some evidence suggests that aloe or its constituents may have anticancer effects. In vitro, individual maloyl glucans had antagonistic effects on cell proliferation, with one stimulating and one inhibiting, suggesting a mechanism by which aloe may have both pro-cancer and anti-cancer effects (30686). Antileukemic and antimutagenic effects of aloe have been shown in vitro and attributed to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (30666). Another constituent, aloe-emodin, has been shown to promote apoptosis by various possible mechanisms, including the involvement of p53 (30673, 30685, 30688). Also, in vitro, aloe-emodin had anti-angiogenesis effects, possibly by affecting urokinase secretion and tubule formation of endothelial cells (30689). In animal research, aloe itself appears to affect detoxification of reactive metabolites by liver and other organs (30667).\nDental effects\nIn human research, use of an aloe gel rinse in the mouth reduces counts of salivary Streptococcus mutans, the pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental plaque (103306).\nDermatological effects\nAloe is commonly used as an ingredient in skin care products. In human research, aloe gel has been shown to reduce ultraviolet (UV)-induced erythema (19770) and increase water content of the stratum corneum (19758). Oral intake of aloe vera gel powder has also been shown to increase skin elasticity, skin hydration, and collagen content of the dermis and reduce transepidermal water loss and markers of skin fatigue (95942, 101577). When applied to psoriatic plaques, aloe extract cream seems to reduce cellular desquamation, erythema, and infiltration. This results in reduction or resolution of the plaques (12096). In an in vitro model of psoriasis, which used tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha to stimulate over-production of cultured human keratinocytes, a polysaccharide extract of aloe mixed into the culture medium in a concentration of 20-80 mcg/mL produced a dose-dependent reduction in keratinocyte proliferation, and a reduction in levels of inflammatory mediators such as interleukins 8 and 12 (98818).\nDetoxification effects\nThere is interest in using aloe to remove toxins from the body. A small clinical study in people who smoke 20 or more cigarettes daily shows that consuming aloe polysaccharide 600 mg daily for 4 weeks increases urinary excretion of tobacco carcinogens and nicotine (102176).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAloe is commonly used for inflammatory bowel diseases and ulcers. In colorectal mucosa in vitro, aloe gel has an antioxidant effect, decreasing levels of colorectal prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8. These effects may explain why aloe gel seems to help some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (12158).\nHypoglycemic effects\nPreliminary animal research suggests that aloe gel might have hypoglycemic effects (11983). Possible mechanisms of action have been explored in laboratory research. Constituents of Kitachi aloe leaf pulp and skin have been found to stimulate beta-cells in diabetic mice, thereby lowering blood glucose levels (30758). However, in human research in patients with diabetes, the evidence is contradictory (12164, 17420, 17488, 17489, 19756, 90121).\nImmune effects\nThere is interest in using aloe as an immune stimulant. In mice, a mannose-rich polysaccharide fraction of aloe gel has been shown to enhance antibody production (30730). Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a specific oral product (ImmunoAloe; Univera Co Ltd) containing processed aloe gel 238 mg as 3 capsules three times daily, starting 4 weeks prior to receiving an inactivated influenza vaccine and continuing for an additional 4 weeks, does not appear to increase seroprotection or seroconversion rates at weeks 4 or 24 after vaccination when compared with placebo (108720).\nLaxative effects\nAnthraquinones contain a tricyclic anthracene nucleus and are cleaved to form anthrones in the colon which are responsible for potent laxative effects (16). Anthrones irritate mucous membranes, causing increased mucous secretion and peristalsis. They also increase fluid and electrolyte secretion into the lumen, causing a feeling of distention. The cathartic effects occur within 10 hours. Water and electrolyte reabsorption are inhibited (8). Aloe latex causes a loss of potassium from cells paralyzing the intestinal muscles. With continued use, increasing doses are needed for a laxative effect, and electrolyte depletion can occur (4, 8).\nRadioprotective effects\nSome clinical evidence suggests that aloe may prevent mucositis associated with radiation therapy (19767, 19964). In vitro, radioprotective effects of aloe polysaccharides were associated with modulation of the cell cycle (30677, 30683).\nWound healing effects\nAloe gel might inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and thereby increase microcirculation and prevent ischemia in wounds. This may speed the healing of burns and frostbite (101, 8224, 12161, 12162). In animal models, aloe seems to prevent the inhibition of wound contraction caused by silver sulfadiazine (SSD). SSD is often applied to wounds, especially burn wounds, to prevent infection. But SSD seems to slow wound healing by inhibiting contraction and epithelialization. Applying aloe in conjunction with SSD seems to improve the speed of wound healing compared to SSD alone (12097). However, there is also evidence SSD improves the rate of wound healing better than aloe when each product is used alone (12161). This suggests that there might be a synergistic effect when SSD and aloe are used together. In animal models of frostbite, aloe gel seems to be more effective for improving tissue survival than pentoxifylline. The combination of pentoxifylline plus aloe gel seems to be better than either agent alone (12162). Topical aloe's anti-inflammatory properties do not appear to interfere with wound healing but rather increase wound tensile strength (30741), possibly due to the fibroblast-stimulating activity of mannose-6-phosphate (30742). Polysaccharides such as mannose stimulate the activity of fibroblast growth factor and increase collagen production. Aloe gel also seems to increase collagen crosslinking, accelerating wound healing (98816).\n\nIn a study using cultures of human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, adding aloe vera gel 2-3% to the culture medium increased proliferation and migration of both types of cells, suggesting the gel could increase the rate of reepithelialization of wounds (98817, 110210)."

Additionally, alpha-GPC use for 2-6 months, 6-12 months, or greater than 12 months is associated with a greater risk of stroke when compared with alpha-GPC use for less than 2 months, suggesting that the increase in stroke risk may be dependent on the total dose received or duration of exposure (108883).\nless\nVascular dementia.

Another small clinical study in middle-distance runners 14-17 years of age shows that taking a specific L-arginine alpha-ketoglutarate product (AAKG 1250 Extreme Mega Caps, Olimp Laboratories) 2.5-3.75 grams, combined with a calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate product (HMB 1250 Mega Caps, Olimp Laboratories) 2.5 grams, 3 times daily attenuates reductions in countermovement jump height during a 12-day intensive training camp when compared with placebo. Markers of muscle damage and stress were similar in both groups (106032). It is unclear if the findings from this study are due to alpha-ketoglutarate, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBariatric surgery complications. Although there has been interest in using oral alpha-ketoglutarate for bariatric surgery complications, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-ketoglutarate for this purpose.\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonia.

Although there has been interest in using oral alpha-ketoglutarate for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-ketoglutarate for this purpose.\nIschemia-reperfusion injury. It is unclear if intravenous alpha-ketoglutarate can prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury during or after heart surgery.\nA small clinical study in male patients undergoing heart surgery shows that intravenous administration of alpha-ketoglutarate 28 grams with blood cardioplegia reduces several markers of ischemia when compared with a control group, suggesting that alpha-ketoglutarate might prevent ischemic injury during heart surgery (5312, 5313).\nless\nLiver disease.

Although there has been interest in using oral alpha-ketoglutarate for SIBO, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-ketoglutarate for this purpose.\nTendinopathy. Oral alpha-ketoglutarate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy shows that taking two sachets of a specific combination product (Tenosan, Agave s.r.l.), each containing methylsulfonylmethane 550 mg, arginine-L-alpha-ketoglutarate 500 mg, hydrolyzed collagen type I 300 mg, Vinitrox 125 mg, bromelain 50 mg, and vitamin C 60 mg, in addition to extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) improves pain and function when compared with ESWT alone (19321). It is unclear if these findings are due to alpha-ketoglutarate, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate alpha-ketoglutarate for these uses.",

However, alpha-ketoglutarate supplements that do not contain calcium are unlikely to interact with phosphate salts. Several small studies suggests that calcium alpha-ketoglutarate can bind to and reduce blood levels of phosphate (5311, 30784, 30785). This interaction is due to the calcium component of calcium alpha-ketoglutarate, which can bind to phosphate and reduce its absorption (30785).\nless",

It is converted to glutamine and glutamate, as well as other amino acids (92472). In the human brain, the exchange rate of alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate is high (30783).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton of glutamate and glutamine, is an intermediate compound in the Krebs cycle (5308).\nAnabolism effects\nThe availability of alpha-ketoglutarate determines the recovery of muscle protein synthesis after surgical trauma (5309). Some evidence suggests that rapidly growing cells use alpha-ketoglutarate when cellular glutamine uptake is limited (5314).\nAnti-aging effects\nLaboratory research suggests that alpha-ketoglutarate might prevent or slow aging in laboratory models. Alpha-ketoglutarate appears to inhibit some of the cellular pathways involved in the aging process (92472). Animal research shows that calcium alpha-ketoglutarate extends the lifespan of middle-aged female mice and extends the disease-free and functional period of life in both male and female mice. It is thought that this is due to the induction of interleukin-10 secretion in T-cells, which suppresses chronic inflammation (106748).\nAnti-catabolism effects\nAlpha-ketoglutarate seems to help reduce muscle protein depletion after surgery or trauma (5309, 5310, 30778). In human research, addition of alpha-ketoglutarate to postoperative total parenteral nutrition prevented the decrease in muscle protein synthesis and free glutamine associated with surgery (5309).\nBone effects\nAlpha-ketoglutarate has been examined in clinical trials for bone health. Alpha-ketoglutarate is a precursor of glutamine, involved in the synthesis of collagen. Also, it might promote the conversion of pro-collagen to collagen (92472).\nExercise performance effects\nSuppliers of athletic nutritional supplements claim alpha-ketoglutarate may be an important adjunct to proper diet and training for the athlete desiring peak performance. They base this claim on studies that show excessive ammonia in the body can combine with alpha-ketoglutarate to reduce ammonia toxicity. So far, the only studies that show alpha-ketoglutarate can reduce ammonia toxicity have been performed in hemodialysis patients (5311). Furthermore, any potential exercise improvements do not seem to be related to improvements in blood flow or hemodynamics in human research (92471).\nHemodialysis effects\nHemodialysis patients who take alpha-ketoglutarate with calcium carbonate have improved amino acid metabolism and reduced hyperphosphatemia (5311).\nWound healing effects\nAs a precursor of glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate is taken up by fibroblasts involved in wound healing (5314). Alpha-ketoglutarate also appears to stimulate the production of pro-collagen in laboratory models (30779). Wounds in patients with diabetes had elevated alpha-ketoglutarate levels when compared with wounds in patients without diabetes. Increased alpha-ketoglutarate levels were also associated with local hypoxia and ischemia and poor glycemic control which is thought to contribute to slower wound healing in patients with diabetes (99496)."

            "Overview": "Alpha-linolenic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid which was identified as essential to humans in the 1980s (94104). Sources include soybean oil, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and walnuts. Alpha-linolenic acid is the precursor to other long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (91402, 48015, 103821).",
            "Warnings": "Due to the different clinical effects between alpha-linolenic acid and other omega-3 fatty acids, use caution in extrapolating information about other omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, to alpha-linolenic acid (12918).",

Other research suggests high intake or serum levels of alpha-linolenic acid does not increase the overall risk of prostate cancer (12961, 15736); however, it might increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer (12961). Association with prostate cancer appears to depend on the sources of alpha-linolenic acid. Dairy and meat sources has been positively associated with prostate cancer, whereas plant sources, such as flaxseed, don't seem to affect prostate cancer risk (12909). According to a clinical trial, intake of alpha-linolenic acid does not appear to increase levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (91402). Also, longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids in fish oils are associated with a decreased risk of total and advanced prostate cancer (12961).\nless\nOther\nAlpha-linolenic acid is a type of fat, containing 9 kilocalories/gram, and may result in weight gain if consumed in excess.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHyperlipidemia. Clinical research suggests that alpha-linolenic acid does not lower lipid levels in adults with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 20 small clinical trials in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking foods or supplements containing alpha-linolenic acid does not reduce lipid levels when compared with control (104256). The findings from this analysis are limited by the heterogeneity of the alpha-linolenic acid supplementation regimens and patient populations.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. Some research suggests that increasing dietary alpha-linolenic acid intake may decrease atherosclerosis.\nEpidemiological research in White adults has found that high dietary intake of linolenic acid is associated with reduced calcified atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. Most dietary linolenic acid is alpha-linolenic acid (only a small fraction is gamma-linolenic acid). For every gram of linolenic acid consumed, risk of coronary artery calcification appears to decrease by 62% (12990). The effects of linolenic acid intake in other populations are unclear.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for atopic dermatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if alpha-linolenic acid is beneficial in patients with ADHD.\nSmall clinical trials show that taking alpha-linolenic acid does not improve symptoms of previously untreated ADHD in children aged 6-16 years. Taking alpha-linolenic acid 1 gram daily for 8 weeks, or taking a combination of alpha-linolenic acid 60 mg, linoleic acid 240 mg, mineral oil 95 mg, and alpha-tocopherol 5 mg twice daily for 7 weeks does not affect ADHD symptom scores when compared with placebo (100660, 100661). However, these studies might have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if increased dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid affects mortality in patients with cancer.\nA large meta-analysis of prospective, observational studies has found that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with a 6% increased risk of mortality from cancer when compared with low dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid (106661).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Population research has found that increased dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid may have some benefit for CVD, but results from clinical research are generally less positive.\nA large meta-analysis of prospective, observational studies has found that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with an 8% or 11% reduced risk of mortality from CVD or coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively, when compared with low dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid. A dose-response analysis and meta-analysis show that a 1-gram increase in daily dietary intake is associated with a 5% reduction in CVD mortality (106661, 107741). Other population research has found that consumption of 1-2 grams of dietary alpha-linolenic acid daily is associated with a reduced risk of a first myocardial infarction (MI) by as much as 59% in both males and females (7152, 7156). The risk of fatal ischemic heart disease is reduced by 65% in females (7153). In patients who have had a previous MI, following a Mediterranean diet rich in alpha-linolenic acid (1.2-1.6 grams daily) and low in saturated fat and cholesterol for 27 months appears to reduce the risk for a second MI by 73% and the risk for death from any cause by 70% when compared to the standard postinfarction diet (7150). Overall, increasing dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid by 1-1.2 grams daily appears to reduce the risk of fatal coronary heart disease by 20% in people with no history of heart disease and by 20% or more in people with existing heart disease (12978, 91403).\n\nHowever, clinical research has not supported these findings. A meta-analysis of a small number of low to moderate quality clinical studies shows that higher intake of alpha-linolenic acid has little to no benefit for primary prevention of CVD, and does not reduce all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, or CHD events. Any reductions in CVD mortality, arrhythmias, or CHD events in individual trials are very small (103955). This may be due in part to the difficulty in separating the effects of alpha-linolenic acid from those of other dietary, lifestyle, or drug interventions (12917). Some research suggests alpha-linolenic acid has a greater effect on coronary heart disease when intake of fish oils is low (12989).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for COPD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral alpha-linolenic acid improves cognitive function in healthy adults.\nClinical research in healthy older Japanese adults with normal cognitive function shows that taking alpha-linolenic acid 2.2 grams daily in the form of flaxseed oil for 12 weeks modestly improves verbal fluency when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on other measures of cognitive function, including attention, concentration, and memory (111060). In healthy adults, consuming a breakfast bar enriched with alpha-linolenic acid 1.4 grams, other amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and caffeine daily for 56 days modestly improves some measures of alertness, short-term memory, and executive function when compared with a placebo bar (98001). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-linolenic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination.Crohn disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nless\nCrohn disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral alpha-linolenic acid is beneficial in patients with depression.\nClinical research in patients aged 60-80 years who have had a myocardial infarction shows that consuming margarine containing alpha-linolenic acid 2 grams daily for 40 months does not reduce symptoms of depression when compared with placebo margarine (104978).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral alpha-linolenic acid is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nEpidemiological research involving overweight and obese individuals has found that eating at least 1.69 grams alpha-linolenic acid daily is associated with a 45% to 47% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with eating only 0.73 grams daily. However, higher intake of alpha-linolenic acid does not appear to be associated with a reduced risk of diabetes in people who are not overweight (101025). In patients with diabetes, epidemiological research shows that lower intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy (101024). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetes who are stable on oral antidiabetic medications shows that adding alpha-linolenic acid 1.5-7.4 grams daily, in the form of flaxseed oil, walnuts, or chia seeds, to a regular diet for 2-12 months does not improve glycemic control when compared with placebo (98002).\nless\nHypertension. Some research suggests that increasing dietary alpha-linolenic acid may decrease the risk of hypertension.\nEpidemiological research has found that high dietary intake of linolenic acid is associated with a reduced risk of hypertension in White adults. Most dietary linolenic acid is alpha-linolenic acid (only a small fraction is gamma-linolenic acid). Eating a diet high in linolenic acid seems to reduce the risk of hypertension by about 33% (12991). The effects of linolenic acid intake in other populations are unclear.\nless\nInfluenza. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nKidney transplant. Observational research suggests that alpha-linolenic acid is not beneficial after a kidney transplant, and may actually increase the risk of mortality.\nEpidemiological research has found that dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid is not associated with improved graft function in kidney transplant. However, kidney transplant recipients in the highest tertile of alpha-linolenic acid intake appear to have a 2.2-fold increased risk of death from any cause when compared with those in the lowest tertile of dietary intake (98003). It is not clear whether this difference is specifically due to alpha-linolenic acid intake or to total fat intake.\nless\nMigraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for migraine headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if increased dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid affects all-cause mortality.\nA large meta-analysis of prospective, observational studies has found that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with a 10% reduced risk of all-cause mortality when compared with low dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid. A dose-response analysis shows that a 1-gram increase in daily dietary intake is associated with a 5% reduction in overall mortality (106661). However, a meta-analysis of 250,000 individuals did not find an association between dietary alpha-linolenic acid intake and all-cause mortality (107741). The validity of this finding is limited by the use of dietary surveys to assess intake and the heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if dietary alpha-linolenic acid reduces the risk for pneumonia.\nEpidemiological research has found that increasing dietary alpha-linolenic acid consumption is associated with a reduced risk of community-acquired pneumonia (13760).\nless\nProstate cancer. There is contradictory evidence about the role of alpha-linolenic acid in prostate cancer.\nSome epidemiologic research suggests that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer (1337, 2558, 7823, 7147, 12978). Other research suggests high intake or serum levels of alpha-linolenic acid is not associated with increased levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) or the overall risk of prostate cancer (12961, 15736, 91402). However, it might increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer (12961). The best evidence to date, which comes from a meta-analysis of five prospective population studies, suggests that increasing intake of alpha-linolenic acid by 0.5 grams daily is associated with a modest 1% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer. However, this analysis is dominated by a single study. A meta-analysis of results from nine prospective population studies suggests that a 0.1% increase in blood levels of alpha-linolenic acid is not associated with prostate cancer risk (90677).\n\nReasons for the discrepancies are not entirely clear, but the source of alpha-linolenic acid appears to be important. Alpha-linolenic acid from dairy and meat sources has been positively associated with prostate cancer. Alpha-linolenic acid from plant sources, such as flaxseed, may not affect prostate cancer risk (12909).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ALA for this condition.\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral alpha-linolenic acid is beneficial for reducing the incidence of respiratory tract infections in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 3-4 years shows that taking alpha-linolenic acid 855 mg, in combination with linoleic acid 596 mg daily from November through February in 2 consecutive years, might reduce the number of recurrent respiratory infections when compared with placebo (10785).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral alpha-linolenic acid is beneficial in patients with RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking an alpha-linolenic acid-rich oil (flaxseed oil) for 3 months does not improve symptoms or laboratory parameters of RA when compared with baseline or with a linoleic acid-rich oil (safflower oil) (5898).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, found in corn, safflower, sunflower, and peanut oils, is known to compete for enzyme systems that elongate alpha-linolenic acid into EPA and DHA (7142). In low-density lipoprotein, a marker of lipid metabolism in the liver, approximately 30% of alpha-linolenic acid is converted to DHA. However, intake of alpha-linolenic acid for 4 or more weeks reduces this conversion by approximately 48% (103821).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlpha-linolenic acid is an essential omega-3 fatty acid. Dietary alpha-linolenic acid is found primarily in vegetable oils such as flaxseed (linseed) oil, canola (rapeseed) oil, and soybean oil; and also in red meat and dairy products (1337). It is also found in margarines and salad dressings that contain vegetable oils (7141, 7142). Walnuts and other edible nuts also contain significant amounts of alpha-linolenic acid. It is found in smaller amounts in green leafy vegetables and chocolate (7141). Alpha-linolenic acid is also a component of human breast milk, infant formulas, and intravenous fat emulsions (7143).\n\nThe body converts alpha-linolenic acid into longer and more unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). Most research suggests that the conversion rates are low; however, they could be as high as 30% (48015, 103821). In some disease states, such as type 1 diabetes, chronic alcoholism, and schizophrenia, the amount of alpha-linolenic acid converted to longer chain fatty acids is reduced (7165); the reason for this is unknown.\nCancer-related effects\nSome researchers are interested in alpha-linolenic acid for prevention of breast cancer. There is some evidence that females with higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid in breast adipose tissue have a lower risk of breast cancer. Fatty acid composition of adipose tissue is thought to reflect past dietary intake, so researchers think high intake of alpha-linolenic acid might have a cancer protective effect (7168). However, there is some concern that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid might actually increase the risk for prostate cancer (1334, 1336, 2558, 2559, 7147, 7823, 7824). Typical figures reported are that males with the highest intakes of alpha-linolenic acid have two to four times the risk of prostate cancer than males with the lowest intake (1336, 2558, 7147, 7824). It has been suggested that alpha-linolenic acid could increase sex hormone levels or formation of free radicals in prostate cell membranes (2558, 7823), but these mechanisms have not been confirmed. Also, it has been found that alpha-linolenic acid levels in biopsy samples are actually lower in more aggressive tumors (7167). Of the food sources of alpha-linolenic acid, prostate cancer risk is most strongly associated with red meat intake (1336, 1337, 2558). However, some research shows an increase in prostate cancer risk after adjustment for meat intake or animal fat (7823, 7147). Both alpha-linolenic acid from animal sources and alpha-linolenic acid from vegetable sources have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (2558). There are not any studies that have investigated whether alpha-linolenic acid supplements affect prostate cancer risk.\nCardiovascular effects\nCardiovascular benefits are often attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids. However, alpha-linolenic acid does not seem to have the same physiological effects as EPA and DHA. Although some researchers have shown that consuming dietary alpha-linolenic acid significantly increases the concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA in platelet phospholipids and plasma lipids (7149, 7166), the amount of EPA made from alpha-linolenic acid is not likely to be clinically significant. Conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to DHA is even less (48015). One of the reasons for this may be that the consumption of omega-6 fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, which are found in corn, safflower, sunflower, and peanut oils, compete for enzyme systems that elongate alpha-linolenic acid into EPA and DHA (7142). The Western diet, including vegetarian diets, usually provides a disproportionate amount of omega-6 fatty acids. For example, the typical Western diet often includes an omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio of 20:1 to 30:1 (7148, 7149). Thus, high dose or long-term consumption of modest amounts of dietary alpha-linolenic acid does not duplicate the effects of preformed EPA+DHA on triglyceride concentrations, on tissue DHA concentrations, or on in vitro susceptibility to oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7141, 7165, 12918). However, the effects of EPA and DHA seem to be similar to alpha-linolenic acid with respect to hemostatic factors such as thromboxane production, bleeding time, and other factors (13768). Also, there is some concern that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can lead to long-chain omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and produce a physiologic state that is favorable for platelet aggregation and clot formation and an increased risk of heart disease (7141, 7142). The ideal omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio in the diet should probably be no more than 4:1 (7141, 7148).\n\nAlthough alpha-linolenic acid might have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and might reduce risk of heart disease, it does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on cholesterol levels (7146, 7165, 103956). For example, some data show that alpha-linolenic acid may slightly increase triglyceride levels when compared with taking EPA with DHA (12918, 103956). However, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults with overweight or obesity shows that consuming alpha-linolenic acid modestly reduces serum triglycerides but slightly increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) when compared with control. Additionally, a small reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed when compared to control (115472). Alpha-linolenic acid also seems to increase arterial compliance and decrease cardiac workload (7165). There is also some evidence that alpha-linolenic acid has antiarrhythmic effects, but researchers are not sure if this is due to alpha-linolenic acid itself, or due to the longer-chain fatty acids EPA and DHA, to which at least some alpha-linolenic acid is converted (7153, 7156). A reduced risk of abnormally prolonged myocardial repolarization is associated with a diet higher in alpha-linolenic acid (12988). Alpha-linolenic acid does not affect measures of coagulation or serum activity of factors associated with coagulation (10323).\nImmune effects\nThere is some evidence that alpha-linolenic acid might have a beneficial effect on immune function (10785). However, in adults, dietary fatty acids do not seem to affect immune response (10786).\nOcular effects\nIn animal research, topical alpha-linolenic acid reduces symptoms of dry eye, possibly by reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines (66677)."

            "Overview": "Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant compound that is produced naturally in the body (30826, 30856, 107893). It can also be obtained via dietary sources such as red meat, organ meats, spinach, broccoli, potatoes, yams, carrots, beets, and yeast (16391).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 2 grams daily for 3 months to 2 years. Lower doses of 600 mg daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 4 years (3540, 3541, 3542, 20479, 96449, 97630, 101867, 101869, 103327, 103333)(103335, 104651, 104660, 113892, 113897). ...when used topically and appropriately. A cream containing alpha-lipoic acid 5% has been used with apparent safety in clinical trials lasting up to 12 weeks (12021). ...when given intravenously and appropriately. Intravenous alpha-lipoic acid has been used safely in doses of up to 6000 mg weekly in clinical trials lasting up to 3 weeks (3540, 3557, 10148, 12106).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 600 mg daily for 3 months in children aged 10-17 years (103330).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts over 600 mg daily. At least five cases of alpha-lipoic acid intoxication have been reported for children aged 14 months to 16 years who consumed alpha-lipoic acid at doses up to 226 mg/kg (approximately 2400 mg). Symptoms of alpha-lipoic acid-induced intoxication included seizures, acidosis, vomiting, and unconsciousness (90444, 96227, 96234, 104653).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used safely during pregnancy at doses up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks (96222).\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nAlpha-lipoic acid appears to be generally well tolerated when used orally, intravenously, or topically.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Headache, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nTopically: Irritation and rash.\n\nIntravenously: Nausea and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports have raised concerns about insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS).\nCardiovascular\nOrally, hypotension has been reported rarely in a clinical trial (104650).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, skin rash and itching have been reported after use of alpha-lipoic acid (16391, 20490, 21674, 96233, 104650). Topically, alpha-lipoic acid can cause local irritation, including burning, stinging, mild rash, or contact dermatitis (12021, 30836, 111701). In one case, an 86-year-old female developed allergic contact dermatitis with severe itching and oozing after applying alpha-lipoic acid 5% cream to her lower extremities. The patient had a positive skin patch test for alpha-lipoic acid, confirming the causative agent (111701). In another case, a 47-year-old female developed contact dermatitis characterized by a pruritic rash and labial adhesions hours after applying a 5% vulvar serum containing lipoic acid 0.9 grams, vitamin E, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and retinol palmitate to the vulva to treat vulvar lichen sclerosis. Testing confirmed that the causative agent was alpha-lipoic acid (111704). Intravenously, local allergic reactions have occurred at the injection site (1547).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, at least 50 published cases of insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) thought to be associated with use of alpha-lipoic acid have been reported (16392, 104656, 104657, 104658, 104659, 107893, 112941). Most reported cases have been associated with alpha-lipoic acid supplements or enriched foods; IAS has not been reported with intake of alpha-lipoic acid in food. IAS has been linked to compounds, such as alpha-lipoic acid, that contain sulfhydryl groups, but it is unclear if taking alpha-lipoic acid with other drugs known to trigger IAS increases the risk (107893, 112941). IAS is characterized by very high serum insulin levels and high titers of autoantibodies against endogenous insulin. Sulfhydryl groups interact with disulfide bonds of insulin, increasing its immunogenicity (112941). Symptoms include severe spontaneous hypoglycemic episodes, as well as hunger and neuroglycopenic symptoms such as blurred vision, weakness, confusion, dizziness, sweating, and palpitations (104656, 104657, 107893, 112941). Time to onset of IAS ranges from 1 week to 4 months (107893). Most cases of IAS have been reported in Japan and have occurred in individuals with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*04:06 allele (16392, 104656, 107893). For patients of European decent, cases of IAS have mainly occurred in individuals with the HLA-DRB1*04:03 allele (104656, 104658, 104659, 107893). This suggests that either of these alleles might produce a genetic predisposition to alpha-lipoic acid-associated IAS. Reported doses of alpha-lipoic acid have ranged from 200-800 mg daily, most commonly 600 mg daily (104656, 104658, 104659, 107893). IAS-related hypoglycemic episodes have been treated with oral or intravenous glucose or sucrose, as well as prednisone. Episodes decline following discontinuation of alpha-lipoic acid, and insulin values normalize within 3-9 months (104656, 104658, 104659, 107893).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting have been reported after use of alpha-lipoic acid (3557, 12106, 16391, 20475, 30844, 96225, 101868, 103327, 103328, 103333)(103335, 104650, 104654, 104655). Higher doses (1200-1800 mg daily) seem to cause more severe effects than lower doses (600 mg daily) (3557, 20475, 30844, 96225). Alpha-lipoic acid may also cause a burning sensation from the throat to the stomach, abdominal discomfort, or bitter taste when used orally (20478, 20490, 21664, 96225). Intravenously, alpha-lipoic acid can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea and vomiting. Adverse effects are more common in patients receiving higher intravenous doses (3557) and may be more common in the elderly (96225).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, alpha-lipoic acid may cause urinary disorders (20479). Oral alpha-lipoic acid has also been associated with a change in urine odor (96225, 103327).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, alpha-lipoic acid may cause headache (21664, 103328, 104655) or dizziness (104650).\n\nIntravenously, paresthesias have been reported to worsen temporarily at the beginning of therapy. Also, intravenous alpha-lipoic acid can cause headache. Adverse effects are more common in patients receiving higher intravenous doses (3557).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily seems to improve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients with diabetes. Its benefits in patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy are unclear.\nSeveral clinical studies show that taking alpha-lipoic acid, either alone or in combination with gamma-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, or vitamin B12, seems to improve neuropathic sensory symptoms such as burning, pain, numbness, and prickling of the feet and legs, as well as objective measures such as ratings of neurological deficit and disability. Symptom improvement seems to occur within 3 to 5 weeks of oral or intravenous dosing (3540, 3541, 3557, 3868, 10148, 12106, 20473, 20475, 20478, 20480)(20481, 20484, 20488, 90447, 103333, 111429, 111703, 113894). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 3 weeks to 2 years reduces the incidence, severity, and frequency of sensory symptoms and improves measures of impairment and neurological disability but does not improve vibration perception threshold or measures of nerve conduction when compared with placebo (111703). Additionally, a similar meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves neuropathy symptoms as assessed with the Total Symptom Score (TSS) when compared with placebo (113894). However, another meta-analysis of 6 studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, that includes some of the same studies, shows that giving alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily orally or intravenously for 3-8 weeks does not improve neuropathic pain when compared with placebo (112937). Likewise, a Cochrane systematic review of 3 clinical studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes shows that alpha-lipoic acid given intravenously and orally has little to no benefit on neuropathy symptoms after 6 months as assessed with the TSS or on impairment as assessed with the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs when compared with placebo (113897).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in conjunction with other treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Meta-analyses of 2-9 clinical studies in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in combination with vitamin B12 and epalrestat for 3-8 weeks improves sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration perception thresholds in the lower limbs when compared with control groups receiving either conventional therapy or the vitamin B12 and epalrestat combination alone (113896). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, all studies were conducted in China and so it is unclear if results can be extrapolated to other geographic regions and populations.\n\nAcross the various studies, alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg taken by mouth daily in one to three divided doses has been used (3540, 3541, 3868, 20475, 20478, 103333, 111429, 113897). A specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and superoxide dismutase 140 IU (ALA600 SOD, Alfa Wassermann) has also been used (20488). Intravenously, alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and 1200 mg daily have been used (3540, 3541, 3557, 10148, 20480, 20481, 20484, 113897). In one study, a specific product (Thiotacid, Eva Pharma) was used (103333).\n\nHowever, some preliminary clinical research shows that lower doses of alpha-lipoic acid are ineffective for improving nerve conduction velocity or subjective complaints of neuropathy (3869, 20479, 20482, 20486, 20487). Also, although there is some preliminary evidence that taking alpha-lipoic acid improves nerve function indices, such as Valsalva maneuver, Ewing's tests, or electrocardiogram measurements in patients with a specific type of diabetic neuropathy called cardiac autonomic neuropathy, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally does not improve clinical symptoms (3542, 20483, 20485, 96223, 107892).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in certain populations. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid is clinically beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 10 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 9 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with placebo (100709). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for 2-16 weeks decreases levels of total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 31 md/dL when compared with placebo. It is unclear whether dose or treatment duration affect these outcomes (107885). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in these meta-analyses provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously. Other clinical trials have investigated the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on plasma lipids. In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg daily for 4 years reduces levels of total and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, when compared to baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose (104650). Furthermore, an additional clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated cholesterol levels at baseline, shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, but does not improve levels of total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo (107890). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment.\n\nHowever, there is contrasting evidence in overweight or obese adults. A meta-analysis of several clinical studies in this population shows that ALA does not improve levels of HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo. ALA 300-1800 mg daily was taken for 4-24 weeks in most of the included studies (116614). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in this meta-analysis provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously.\n\nThe reason for the discrepant findings could be contributed to the heterogeneity among the included clinical studies, including existing comorbidities in the patient populations and the incorporation of dietary and exercise programs. Also, while many patients in these studies may have had elevated lipid levels at baseline, none of the studies specifically evaluated patients with hyperlipidemia. Thus, the benefits of alpha-lipoic acid in these patients is unclear.\nless\nObesity. Most research shows that oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to improve weight loss by a small amount.\nWhile individual clinical studies show mixed results (21674, 97630, 100710, 103327, 103334), meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1800 mg daily for 2-48 weeks can modestly reduce body weight by 0.7-2.3 kg and body mass index (BMI) by up to 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo in overweight individuals or patients with obesity. The magnitude of these improvements are not dependent on the dose or duration of treatment (96231, 96232, 103332, 111294). While these improvements are statistically significant, they may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with obesity shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg orally daily for 8-10 weeks improves some markers of insulin resistance, but not blood pressure or cholesterol levels (111294).\n\nTaking alpha-lipoic acid might also reduce body weight in overweight children or children with obesity. In adolescents aged 10-17 years, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces body weight by 3.2 kg when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood lipids or fasting blood glucose (103330). Also, a small clinical study in children 8-16 years of age shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Tiobec 800, Laborest) 800 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve body weight, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipids, glycemic control, insulin resistance, or endothelial function when compared with placebo (100708). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in many of these outcomes.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAlcohol-related liver disease. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve liver function in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.\nTaking alpha-lipoic acid orally 300 mg daily for up to 6 months does not appear to improve liver function or reduce liver damage when compared with placebo in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (3880, 21678).\nless\nAltitude sickness. Oral alpha-lipoic acid, in combination with vitamins C and E, does not seem to be beneficial for altitude sickness prevention or treatment.\nClinical research in healthy volunteers ascending to 5200 meters shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg in combination with vitamin C 1 gram and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU in four divided doses daily, beginning on the day of travel to high altitude and continuing for 2 weeks thereafter, does not prevent the occurrence nor decrease the severity of altitude sickness when compared with placebo (20499).\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent nephropathy after undergoing coronary angiography.\nIn diabetic patients at low risk for contrast induced nephropathy, alpha-lipoic acid (Thioactacid 600 mg RH, MEDA Manufacturing GmbH) 600 mg taken 30 minutes prior to and 24 and 48 hours after undergoing coronary angiography, with or without standard hydration therapy, does not reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy when compared with standard hydration therapy (90442). In addition, treatment with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally every 8 hours beginning the afternoon prior to angiography and continuing for 2 days does not attenuate the maximum increase in serum creatinine or reduce the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy in most patients when compared with standard hydration therapy alone (90446).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to be beneficial for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nAlthough some conflicting findings from individual studies exist, the overall evidence does not support the use of oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for improving glycemic control or insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes (3545, 3874, 3875, 3876, 20490, 20493, 20494, 20495, 20496, 90443)(90445, 110118, 111305). A meta-analysis of 16 small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200-1200 mg daily for up to 52 weeks leads to slight improvements in glycemic control and body weight, but these improvements are not clinically significant. When compared with placebo, alpha-lipoic acid reduced fasting blood glucose by 6 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.17%, body weight by 0.7 kg, and body mass index (BMI) by 1.1 kg/m2. While triglyceride levels were reduced by 19 mg/dL, improvements in other lipids levels and blood pressure were lacking (110118). A specific alpha-lipoic acid product administered orally or intravenously in some of these studies was Thioctacid (Asta Medica) (3874, 3875, 3876).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients with gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes. A small clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes shows the taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks improves fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity but does not affect HbA1C when compared with placebo (107890). The validity of this study is limited due to its short duration, which was likely inadequate to detect a change in HbA1c. Also, one small clinical study in adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes who show signs of early stage diabetic cardiomyopathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 4 months, in combination with insulin therapy, improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic function (90443).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent macular edema in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\nSome research shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 months does not improve the incidence of clinically significant macular edema when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (20491).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related dementia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve cognitive impairment related to this condition.\nClinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily, alone or along with selegiline (Deprenyl), for 10 weeks may worsen HIV-associated cognitive impairment and does not affect mood or functional status when compared with placebo in patients with confirmed HIV infection and evidence of cognitive impairment (1556).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly adults shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with baseline (111303). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for AMD.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Pure Encapsulations) 1200 mg daily for 18 months does not improve visual acuity or reduce the rate of atrophy when compared with placebo in patients with advanced AMD (103335). It is unclear if alpha-lipoic acid would be beneficial in patients with less severe symptoms of AMD.\nless\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in males with overweight or obesity, mild erectile dysfunction, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) increases testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and measures of erectile dysfunction but not follicle-stimulating hormone or sperm parameters when compared to baseline (111674). The validity of these findings is limited by the small sample size and lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAging skin. Topical alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial for aging skin.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a cream containing alpha-lipoic acid 5% to the face twice daily for 12 weeks reduces the fine lines and roughness associated with aging of facial skin when compared with a control cream (12021).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for this condition.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg once daily in combination with standard cholinesterase inhibitors may slow cognitive decline when compared with cholinesterase inhibitors alone in some patients with Alzheimer disease (20500, 90437). However, higher-quality clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-900 mg daily for up to 2 years, in combination with vitamin C and vitamin E, does not affect cognitive function when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (19206, 20501).\nless\nAmanita mushroom poisoning. Evidence on the use of intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for amanita mushroom poisoning is limited to anecdotal reports.\nIntravenous alpha-lipoic acid has been used in combination with other treatments for poisoning from amanita mushroom ingestion. Its use is controversial. Reports are anecdotal, and experimental evidence does not support its effectiveness. Some researchers recommend against its use (105, 1548, 1549, 3871, 3879).\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity.\nA small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months does not improve ejection fraction but does decrease levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a marker of ventricular hypertrophy, when compared with placebo (110112).\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention or treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia.\nA very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces prolactin levels by 51% when compared to baseline (110116). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. Small clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects in patients with schizophrenia.\nA very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose levels by around 17 mg/dL but actually increases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.14% when compared to baseline. No improvements in body weight or lipid levels were reported (110116). Another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo (110115).\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking a specific combination product (Opera, Gamfarma Srl) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 200 mg, and bromelain 20 mg once daily for 6 months reduces arthralgia intensity when compared to baseline, with around 22% of patients having complete symptom resolution at the end of the study (109570). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for atrial fibrillation.\nClinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce the recurrence of atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo in patients who underwent a catheter ablation procedure. However, there was a decrease in the need for antiarrhythmic drugs in patients receiving alpha-lipoic acid (97628).\nless\nBack pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn observational study in adults with chronic lower back pain and sciatica suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg, and myrrh 200 mg daily for 30 days, along with periradicular infiltrations of oxygen-ozone, is associated with resolution of pain in 17% more patients when compared with periradicular steroid infiltrations at 60 days (111308). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia major.\nA small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia major who are receiving iron chelation therapy shows that adding oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg before breakfast or dinner for 8 weeks reduces levels of serum ferritin when compared with placebo (107888). Serum ferritin was reduced by 104 ng/mL and 38 ng/mL in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. The validity of this finding is limited due to the small, exploratory nature of the study.\nless\nBipolar disorder. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg plus alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg up to three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression when compared with placebo in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder (90441).\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for burning mouth syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of nine small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400-800 mg daily for up to 2 months does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo or active controls such as multivitamins, Biotene mouth rinse, capsaicin, laser therapy, clonazepam, or pregabalin. However, in an analysis of three placebo-controlled studies, alpha-lipoic acid increased the likelihood of any burning mouth syndrome-related symptom improvement by 92% when compared with placebo (110111). Individual studies, most of which were included in the analysis, show conflicting results overall (20474, 21661, 21662, 21663, 21664, 21665, 21666, 111427). One small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves symptoms of burning mouth syndrome in patients who had never previously been treated with anxiolytics or antidepressants, but not in those who had received these prior treatments (21668). This suggests that alpha-lipoic acid may improve symptoms of burning mouth syndrome resulting from stress, but not from depression or drug-induced hyposalivation.\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, either before or after surgery.\nIn patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 60 days reduces pain by a moderate amount when compared with not taking alpha-lipoic acid, but with no effect on functionality (103328). In patients with neuropathic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome, giving alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously daily for 30 days, then 600 mg orally daily for 60 days, decreases pain on a visual analog scale, and improves functionality when compared with oral alpha-lipoic acid alone, or no treatment (112938).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One study shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and gamma-linolenic acid 360 mg for 90 days improves functional scores and subjective symptom scores when compared to baseline (21653). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control (111702). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients who have undergone carpal tunnel release surgery. Taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 40 days starting immediately after surgery does not improve the rate of nerve recovery when compared with placebo, although it seems to reduce the occurrence of post-operative pillar pain, which is a common complication of carpal tunnel release surgery (96233).\nless\nCataracts. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nCervical dysplasia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with cervical dysplasia.\nA small clinical study in patients with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces the proportion of patients with intraepithelial neoplasia by 95% when compared with placebo (110113).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\nOne clinical study shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg three times daily for 24 weeks during treatment with cisplatin or oxaliplatin does not affect the symptoms or severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo (90439). However, another small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months reduces the severity of peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo (110112). The reason for this disparate finding is unclear, but it may be due to differences in chemotherapy regimens.\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Opera, Gamfarma s.r.l.) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 200 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, and bromelain 20 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces overall pain when compared to baseline in adults with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (96449). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally once daily and ipidacrine 20 mg orally three times daily throughout 6 paclitaxel-based chemotherapy cycles improves sensory nerve action potential parameters when compared with control (111292). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for CKD.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with stage 2 or 3 CKD related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 1.6 grams daily for 6 months has modest benefits on biochemical markers and cognitive tests when compared to control. Taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces serum glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and uric acid levels, and improves insulin resistance and flow-mediated dilation and cognitive test results. However, there was no effect on intima media thickness or the ankle brachial index (101867).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, coenzyme Q10 100 mg, magnesium orotate 400 mg, and omega-3 fatty acids 300 mg three times daily, with selenium 200 mcg once daily, for up to 2 months prior and 1 month after surgery, decreases plasma troponin levels and reduces the average postoperative hospital stay by 1.2 days when compared with placebo (21651). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with persistent loss of the sense of smell after COVID-19 infection.\nIn adults with sense of smell loss persisting for more than 3 months after COVID-19 infection, adding alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks to olfactory training reduces the incidence of anosmia, and improves the olfactory threshold, the sense of smell measured on a visual analog scale, and the smell identification score by a similar amount to placebo (112935). Additionally, a small clinical trial in adults with persistent olfactory dysfunction and treatment refractory parosmia due to previous COVID-19 infection shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg daily for 6 months in combination with olfactory training does not improve tests of odor threshold, detection, and identification or reduce patient-reported symptoms of parosmia when compared with olfactory training alone (113892).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. When used in combination with certain conventional medications, intravenous or oral alpha-lipoic acid may improve some measures of albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid (YantaiZhichu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 450 mg plus intravenous alprostadil 20 mcg once daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate by 23% and cystatin C levels by 19% when compared with alprostadil alone (96221). Patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously plus valsartan 80 mg orally once daily for 14 days showed a 25% lower urinary albumin excretion rate and a 27% and 31% lower serum level of beta2-microglobulin and cystatin C, respectively, when compared with patients treated with valsartan alone (101866). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg daily in combination with oral valsartan 80 mg daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate, as well as levels of urinary albumin and serum beta 2-microglobulin, when compared with either valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone (107891). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and the presence of potential publication bias. Additionally, the long-term benefits of alpha-lipoic acid are unclear.\n\nAnother meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in conjunction with other medications (e.g. antihypertensives, vitamin B6) for 3-18 months reduces levels of urine albumin, but does not improve urinary albumin excretion rate, when compared with placebo. Notably, alpha-lipoic acid alone did not affect outcomes (107886). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies; additionally, the quality of evidence was considered low to moderate.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if topical alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with dry eye.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetes and dry eye symptoms shows that application of an eye drop containing alpha-lipoic acid 0.1% and hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) 0.3% three times daily for 2 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of dry eye symptoms when compared with HPMC alone (110119).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for dysmenorrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily, with or without mefenamic acid 250 mg daily, for 5 days starting before menstruation reduces pain associated with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea by approximately 24% and 44%, respectively, when compared to baseline (101871). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for ED.\nPreliminary clinical research in males with diabetes and ED shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg with alprostadil 10 mcg once daily for 14 days improves the quality and frequency of erection in 95% of patients, compared with only 81% of those taking tadalafil 5 mg orally daily (96224). It is not clear if this improvement is due to alpha-lipoic acid, alprostadil, or the combination. Another very small study in males with mild ED, overweight or obesity, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared to baseline (111674). The validity of these finding is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for fibromyalgia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (SiSU Vita Health) 600-1800 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia (104655).\n\nAlpha lipoic acid has also been studied as a combination therapy for fibromyalgia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with fibromyalgia shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid and pregabalin for 6 weeks does not improve pain or depression scores when compared with either product alone (111428). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, omega-3 fatty acids 2240 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 27.9 mg, lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, zinc 15 mg, copper 1 mg, and taurine 150 mg (NuaDHA Vision, Nua Biological) orally daily for 6 months does not improve intraocular pressure when compared with baseline (111310).\nless\nHeart failure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with heart failure participating in a handgrip exercise shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin E, and vitamin C reduces mean arterial pressure by about 6 mmHg and reduces vascular resistance by about 12% when compared with placebo (19219). The first dose consisted of vitamin E 200 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg. The subsequent dose consisted of vitamin E 400 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg (19219). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHemorrhoids. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hemorrhoids.\nA preliminary open-label clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200 mg daily for 12 weeks decreases anal pain while sitting, pain at defecation, itching, and bleeding when compared with no treatment in patients with second- and third-degree hemorrhoids (100707). The validity of these results is limited by a lack of blinding and placebo control.\nless\nHerniated disc. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational study in adults with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disc herniation shows that taking a combination supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 404 mg, myrrh, and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Tiobec Dol, Uriach Italy Srl) twice daily for 4 weeks, along with steroids and as needed opioids, reduces pain and disability and improves physical but not mental health as it pertains to quality of life when compared with steroids and as needed opioids alone (111711). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for patients with HIV/AIDS who are unresponsive to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).\nA small clinical study in patients who were unresponsive to HAART shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Alpha Lipoic Sustain 300, Jarrow Formulas) 300 mg three times daily for 6 months improves lymphocyte proliferation and whole blood glutathione levels when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in HIV RNA levels or CD4 count (21655).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hypertension.\nClinical research in a small number of patients with mild (stage I) hypertension shows that adding alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily to quinapril 40 mg daily for 8 weeks does not significantly decrease blood pressure when compared with quinapril alone (21656). A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that alpha-lipoic acid lowers systolic blood pressure by a mean of about 5 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of about 3 mmHg, but there is significant heterogeneity between the studies. The small decrease in blood pressure is also only seen with doses of alpha-lipoic acid below 800 mg daily when given for 12 weeks or less (112934).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. Clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, however it might be beneficial in certain populations.\nIn overweight adults with elevated triglycerides, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (103327). In addition, a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients with or without hypertriglyceridemia at baseline shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (100709). However, one clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated triglyceride levels at baseline, shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 30 mg/dL, compared with an increase of 5 mg/dL in those taking placebo, a difference that was statistically significant (107890). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 2 weeks decreases postprandial plasma glucose, steady state plasma insulin, cholesterol, and fatty acid levels and increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (21657). In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg for 4 years reduces levels of fasting plasma glucose when compared with baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose (104650). While some patients in this study had prediabetes or impaired fasting glucose at baseline, the study did not specifically evaluate patients with prediabetes.\nless\nInfertility. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid to increase the chance of pregnancy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for infertility.\nInterstitial cystitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn individuals with vulval pain associated with painful bladder syndrome, clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, docosahexaenoic acid 250 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid 16.67 mg, vitamin E 12 mg, vitamin D 5 mg, and magnesium 56.25 mg (ALAnerv Age; Alfa Wassermann) daily in combination with amitriptyline up to 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces pelvic pain between 15% to 49% more than amitriptyline alone. Also, use of the combination supplement more than doubled the number of patients with an improvement in pain during intercourse (97629). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLyme disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nMale infertility. Most clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid might improve some sperm characteristics in males with infertility. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid improves pregnancy or live birth rates in these individuals.\nA meta-analysis of 5 moderate-quality clinical studies in males with infertility shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80-90 days modestly increases sperm progressive and total motility and reduces abnormal sperm morphology when compared with placebo. However, sperm concentration, sperm vitality, semen volume, and pregnancy rates show no significant improvements when compared with placebo (116615). Another small clinical study in males with infertility due to high levels of sperm DNA damage shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80 days does not improve pregnancy rate, sperm motility, sperm concentration, semen volume, or other measures of sperm health when compared with placebo (110109).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in males with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) shows that taking one tablet daily of a specific product (Fertiplus SOD, Idi-Pharma) containing alpha-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and other nutrients 30 days prior to IVF procedures improves the pregnancy rate from 9% of all embryo transfers pre-treatment to 45% and reduces the rate of miscarriage when compared to baseline (97627). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks modestly improved serum triglyceride levels, but not serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo (111307). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with migraine headaches.\nA meta-analysis of two small, moderate-quality clinical studies in adults in Iran and Belgium with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces migraine frequency by approximately 1 per month and improves migraine severity, but not migraine duration when compared with placebo (115873). However, clinical significance is unlikely. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity across clinical studies. A small clinical study, not included in the above meta-analysis, in adults with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg twice daily for 6 months reduces migraine frequency by at least 50% in 69% of patients and reduces the need for migraine treatment by 56% when compared to baseline, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96229).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in adolescents for migraine prophylaxis. A small open-label study in adolescents aged 10-19 years with a history of migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg with flunarizine 5 mg as prophylaxis daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and reduces monthly migraine headache days by 9 days, but does not reduce migraine severity or measures of disability when compared with flunarizine alone. For every 3 patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid and flunarizine over flunarizine alone, 1 additional patient had a 50% or greater reduction in migraine frequency (111706). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nMiscarriage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, hyaluronic acid, magnesium, vitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone (113893). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo for the control group.\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid prevents a loss of muscle strength after exercise.\nIn athletes, a small clinical trial shows that taking a single dose of alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg (Athenion GmbH) after an intensive load protocol does not prevent loss of leg strength approximately 24 hours later when compared with placebo. However, taking the same dose for 2 days, followed by 300 mg daily during a 6-day training protocol, results in the maintenance of leg strength, compared with a loss in those taking placebo (104652).\nless\nNeck pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg plus superoxide dismutase 140 IU once daily for 2 months, along with physiotherapy, reduces chronic neck pain in approximately 50% more patients when compared with physiotherapy alone (90440).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with neuropathic pain.\nIn patients with peripheral neuropathies, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally, up to 1800 mg daily for 6 weeks, is less effective for reducing pain intensity scores and improving quality of life than pregabalin, taken orally in doses up to 450 mg daily (112940). A nonblinded clinical study in patients with refractory chronic lumbosacral radicular pain shows that taking alpha lipoic acid orally, 600 mg three times daily for 3 weeks followed by 600 mg daily for 2 weeks, in addition to a single, pulsed radiofrequency treatment to the dorsal ganglion, improves pain severity and disability scores at 6 months when compared with pulsed radiofrequency treatment alone. A pain score of less than 4 is achieved at 12 weeks in about 80% of patients taking alpha lipoic acid, compared with about 65% of patients without alpha-lipoic acid. (107895).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for NAFLD.\nSmall clinical studies in adults with NAFLD and obesity show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, cholesterol levels, body weight, or visceral fat when compared with placebo or control (104660, 100710, 111304). However, these clinical trials show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks may provide small improvements in interleukin-6 levels, adiponectin levels, and insulin resistance (104660, 100710). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of these outcomes.\nless\nOrthostatic hypotension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for orthostatic hypotension.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 430-788 mg orally daily for a mean of 2.3 years attenuates changes in blood pressure upon standing when compared with baseline in some patients with chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic intolerance (101868).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nA small nonrandomized study in adults with osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 weeks with standard therapy (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications) improves patient-reported assessment of pain and functionality when compared with standard therapy alone (115743). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these results is limited due to the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nless\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for various chronic pain conditions.\nA clinical study in patients with untreated, mild to moderate idiopathic pain (i.e. neuropathic pain, joint pain, and muscle pain with unknown etiology) shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg once or twice daily for 2 months may improve pain severity when compared with baseline, with greater effects observed with daily doses of 800 mg (107887). Although the study enrolled a control group, a statistical comparison between groups was not conducted, limiting the validity of this finding. Additionally, sub-analyses evaluating outcomes based on type of chronic pain were not conducted.\nless\nPeriodontitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 25 mg, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo (111708).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PAD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily reduces pain associated with exercise in people with PAD and claudication when compared with placebo. However, exercise tolerance does not seem to improve (16391).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PCOS.\nAlpha-lipoic acid has been studied alone and in combination with inositol for the treatment of PCOS.\n\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials in young adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 6-25 weeks, alone or in combination with inositol, reduces fasting blood sugar and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with control. However, there is no effect on insulin levels, body mass index, lipid profile, or hormone levels (112939).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in a number of retrospective observational studies for PCOS. A small retrospective study in patients with PCOS and overweight or obesity suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with improved insulin sensitivity, hepatic insulin extraction index, and levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase when compared to baseline. However, levels of reproductive hormones did not change over the 12 weeks (113895). Other observational research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 2000 mg, alone or in combination with myo-inositol (Sinopol, Laborest s.r.l.) 800-1000 mg, daily for 3-24 months is associated with reduced insulin levels and reduced menstrual cycle length, but not weight loss or improvements in hirsutism or insulin resistance, when compared to baseline (101869, 101870). Another observational study shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 800 mg with a higher dose of myo-inositol 2000 mg is associated with slightly greater weight loss when compared with myo-inositol 1000 mg daily (103751). Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of reproductive hormones, although improvements occur when alpha-lipoic acid is taken in combination with inositol 1000 mg daily (101870). The validity of this research is limited by the retrospective nature of the studies. Additionally, all of observational studies were conducted in Italy, which may limit generalizability of findings to other geographic regions and populations.\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if vaginal alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for preventing preterm birth.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administering alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg vaginally once nightly for 30 days after an episode of preterm labor prevents cervical shortening when compared with placebo (96226). It is unclear if these findings are associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth.\nless\nRadiation exposure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid might reduce radiation levels in children living in areas contaminated with radiation.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg, alone or in combination with vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 200 mg, daily for 28 days reduces chemiluminescence in leukocytes and urinary radioactivity when compared to baseline in children living in areas contaminated with radiation (21669).\nless\nSchizophrenia. There is mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid in patients with schizophrenia.\nA small clinical study in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia receiving conventional antipsychotic therapy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves scores related to negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not positive symptoms, when compared with placebo (110114). A very small, open-label study in patients with stable, chronic schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily along with ongoing antipsychotic medication for 4 months improves symptoms by 64% when compared to baseline. Specific symptom domains, including negative and positive symptoms, excitement, depressive symptoms, and extrapyramidal symptoms all show improvement, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96228). In contrast, another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive function when compared with placebo (110115). Also, a very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks does not improve positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia when compared to baseline (110116). A meta-analysis of 4 studies in patients with clinically stable schizophrenia does not show any benefit of oral alpha-lipoic acid when compared with placebo, although details of the analysis are limited (112936). Overall, the reasons for the disparate research findings are unclear, but they may be due to differences in the alpha-lipoic acid dose, treatment duration, and severity of schizophrenia across studies.\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients who responded well to antipsychotic therapy after a single episode of psychosis shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1000 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 500 mg twice daily does not prevent 2-year cumulative relapse or delay relapse time when compared with placebo (90675).\nless\nSciatica. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for sciatica.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disc shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Byodiniral 300 QR, MDM SpA) 600 mg daily for 60 days improves signs and symptoms of sciatica and decreases the use of analgesics when compared with taking acetyl-L-carnitine (Nicetile, SigmaTau Ind. Farm. Riunite SpA) 1180 mg daily (21671). However, taking alpha-lipoic acid does not affect sleep quality in these patients.\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients for sciatica. Observational research in patients with sciatic pain due to herniated discs suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myrrh extract 200 mg, and palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg daily for 20 days along with 3 sessions of oxygen-ozone therapy over 30 days is associated with slight improvements in pain when compared with oxygen-ozone therapy alone (111113). It is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for tinnitus.\nA small observational study in patients with tinnitus associated with cochlear dysfunction and metabolic syndrome suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg for 60 days is associated with improvements in several audiometric parameters and overall tinnitus handicap inventory scores, with a larger effect on functional and emotional scores, when compared to baseline. However, patients with tinnitus secondary to acoustic nerve lesions do not appear to benefit from alpha-lipoic acid supplementation (111705). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group.\nless\nToxin-induced liver damage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 250 mg, coenzyme Q10 200 mg, and acetyl-L-carnitine 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the risk of drug-induced liver injury by 73% when compared with placebo (107445). It is unclear if these findings are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVertigo. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL shows that taking a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg, piperine 1 mg, cholecalciferol 800 units, vitamin B2 0.8 mg, and vitamin B6 1 mg (Vertistop D, Difass) orally daily for 6 months moderately reduces the number of vertigo relapse episodes when compared with control. However, in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than 20 ng/mL that took a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg and piperine 1 mg (Vertistop L, Difass) orally daily for 6 months there was no difference in relapse episodes when compared with control (111294). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVitiligo. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for vitiligo when used in conjunction with phototherapy.\nWhen used in combination with phototherapy, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Shandong Qidu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 300 mg daily for 6 months does not improve repigmentation when compared with placebo (104654). In contrast, a small clinical study shows that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Lipoacid Combi, General Topics) containing alpha-lipoic acid 50 mg, vitamin C 50 mg, vitamin E 20 mg, and polyunsaturated fatty acids 12%, starting 8 weeks prior to ultraviolet B phototherapy and continuing for 6 months during phototherapy treatment, seems to increase the likelihood of repigmentation by 29% when compared with placebo (19210). It is not clear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWilson disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Wilson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for wound healing.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific alpha-lipoic acid product (Byodinoral 300, M.D.M. Spa) 300 mg one hour before and one hour after hyperbaric oxygen therapy administered daily for 14-30 days reduces wound area in 30% more patients with ischemic ulcers when compared with hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone (21677).\nless\nWrinkled skin. Although there is interest in using topical alpha-lipoic acid for wrinkled skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate alpha-lipoic acid for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nIn clinical research, the median maximum tolerated dose of alpha-lipoic acid was 1663 mg daily (104655).\n\nAt least five cases of alpha-lipoic acid intoxication have been reported in children (90444, 96227, 96234, 104653). A fatal, non-accidental overdose of alpha-lipoic acid has been reported in a 14-year-old female who consumed an unknown quantity of alpha-lipoic acid, acetaminophen, and norfenefrine. The patient became unconscious, began seizing, progressed into multi-organ failure including renal failure, cardiac failure, coagulopathy, and hemolysis, and subsequently died. At the time of admission, the blood level of acetaminophen was within normal limits whereas the blood level of alpha-lipoic acid was 30,900 mcg/L; norfenefrine levels could not be measured (96234). In a 16-year-old female, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg three times at 30-minute intervals resulted in metabolic acidosis with coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis (104653). Two cases have involved accidental ingestion by toddlers. One case involved a 20-month-old male who consumed alpha-lipoic acid 226 mg/kg (approximately 2400 mg). Another case involved a 14-month-old female who consumed an unknown quantity of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg tablets. Symptoms of intoxication included lethargy, status epilepticus, unconsciousness, and metabolic acidosis (90444, 96227).\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid toxicity has also been reported in adults. These cases have involved both non-accidental and accidental exposures. Metabolic acidosis and neurological symptoms occurred in at least three cases. In one case, a 70-year-old was prescribed alpha-lipoic acid along with pantoprazole and nadroparin following lumbar spine surgery. However, a prescribing error led to the ingestion of alpha-lipoic acid 4.5 grams from an industrial preparation. Symptoms included tonic-clonic seizures within 30 minutes of ingestion, elevated liver enzymes, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and severe lactic acidosis (101872). In another case, an adult ingested alpha-lipoic acid 6 grams and acetaminophen 7.5 grams orally. The patient presented with severe agitation, metabolic acidosis, convulsions, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis. This patient expired after an episode of cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest (111426).\nTreatment\nA specific antidote for alpha-lipoic acid is not available. Management of alpha-lipoic acid consists of supportive care, which may include anti-epileptics and thiopental for seizures, sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy, and endotracheal intubation and vasopressors for cardiopulmonary support (96227, 104653, 101872, 111426).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe oral bioavailability of alpha-lipoic acid is about 20% to 40%, due to low solubility in the stomach, extensive first-pass degradation, and rapid reduction to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) ( 107893,112938). When administered orally, almost twice as much R(+)alpha-lipoic acid is absorbed as the S(-) form. Food reduces the absorption of alpha-lipoic acid. A full stomach reduces absorption of both forms by approximately 30% (30932).\n\nFollowing oral doses of alpha-lipoic acid, two plasma peaks have been noted: the first peak between one and two hours and the second between three and four hours (30850). Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 0.661 mcg/mL and mean time to peak (Tmax) was 80 minutes after a single oral dose of 200 mg of alpha-lipoic acid (3872). Oral doses of 50-600 mg appear to act in a linear and dose-dependent manner (107893).\n\nOphthalmic administration of alpha-lipoic acid in eyedrops resulted in penetration in the human aqueous fluid, with levels increasing from 27.5 ng/mL to a maximum of 91.2 ng/mL after 93 minutes (30887).\nDistribution\nFree alpha-lipoic acid, which may mediate the antioxidant properties of alpha-lipoic acid, is of low molecular weight and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier (1561, 30843, 30929).\nMetabolism\nAlpha-lipoic acid is extensively metabolized in the liver and rapidly conjugated (30805, 30939). A significant first pass effect is observed and may contribute to a low bioavailability of around 20% to 40% (107893). In the erythrocyte, alpha-lipoic acid is reduced to DHLA by lipoate dehydrogenase (30922, 107893). Main circulating metabolites include s-methylated beta-oxidation products 4,6-bismethylthiohexanoic acid and 2,4-bismethylthiobutanoic acid (30805, 107893).\nExcretion\nAlpha-lipoic acid is found in minimal levels in the urine. The metabolite 4,6-bis-methylthio-hexanoic acid (BMHA) is detectable for about 24 hours (103335). Alpha-lipoic acid does not appear to be influenced by creatinine clearance, reduced kidney function, or hemodialysis (30805). In human research, the half-life of orally administered alpha-lipoic acid was found to be 0.5 hours (30787, 107893).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlpha-lipoic acid is about 30% absorbed from dietary or supplemental sources, and is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) in many tissues (1561, 3871, 3872). Endogenous alpha-lipoic acid is a coenzyme that, together with pyrophosphatase, is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle which produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (12021, 107893).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlpha-lipoic acid is a modulator of the inflammatory response and may suppress vascular inflammation (12021, 16391, 103327). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been shown to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with multiple sclerosis when administered at a dose of 1200 mg (30892). Increased cAMP is believed to decrease inflammation and apoptosis. Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily has been shown to reduce levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 in obese patients (21657, 103330). In addition, negative correlations between insulin sensitivity index and levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been noted in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance (21657). A meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300-1200 mg for 1-48 weeks reduces levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha when compared with placebo (107894). Although some research disagrees, alpha-lipoic acid also appears to reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human research (14010, 104650, 107889, 107894, 101867, 115744).\n\nIn vitro evidence shows that alpha-lipoic acid strongly suppresses proinflammatory TNF-alpha and IL-1beta-induced fractalkine expression in endothelial cells by suppressing the activities of nuclear factor-kappaB and specificity protein-1 (30826). Clinical research in females who have not delivered after an episode of preterm labor shows that alpha-lipoic acid increases the presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the cervical fluid but does not alter the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (96226). Alpha-lipoic acid also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte activation and acute inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (30842). Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to be an endogenous regulator of secretory phospholipase (PL) A2 enzyme activity and suppress inflammatory reactions (30838).\nAntineoplastic effects\nAlpha-lipoic acid has been shown to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells in vitro by increasing mitochondrial respiration (30818).\nAntioxidant effects\nExogenous alpha-lipoic acid, and the metabolite DHLA, have antioxidant activity and can scavenge free radicals both intra- and extracellularly (3871, 30922). Alpha-lipoic acid is both water and fat soluble and can regenerate endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and glutathione, and prevent oxidative damage (1547, 1550, 3546, 3871, 3885, 30788, 30916, 30919, 30923, 30926)(30935, 30936, 30937). Preliminary data suggests that these antioxidant effects might provide protection in cerebral ischemia, excitotoxic amino acid brain injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxia-reoxygenation, muscle ischemia associated with peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, and other causes of damage to brain or neural tissue (1561, 3546, 3871, 3877, 10148, 16391, 30789, 30847, 30924). Alpha-lipoic acid has shown promise in experimental models to prevent aminoglycoside-induced cochlear damage, and metal (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury) and chemical (hexachlorobenzene, n-hexane) poisoning (3871, 3879, 3881, 3882, 3883, 3884, 30921). Children treated with alpha-lipoic acid, alone or in combination with vitamin E, showed normalized organ function and lessened indices of oxidative damage following radiation exposure in the Chernobyl accident (3871).\n\nThe antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might be beneficial in conditions in which oxidative stress is a factor, although effects may differ for each patient population (3879, 107888, 107889, 107891, 111306). A meta-analysis and other clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg daily in combination with valsartan 80 mg and/or amlodipine daily for 14 days improves total antioxidant capacity and reduces levels of oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, when compared with valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone (107891, 111306). A small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia receiving standard iron chelation therapy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 8 weeks may decrease serum levels of malondialdehyde when compared with placebo, with no effect on total antioxidant capacity (107888). Clinical research in non-menopausal females with episodic migraines without aura shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily before lunch and dinner for 3 months reduces levels of serum malondialdehyde, but does not affect total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, total antioxidant status, or oxidative stress index, when compared with placebo (107889).\nAntiplatelet activity\nClinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits platelet aggregation in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy after 12 weeks (115872).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary data suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can inhibit replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by inhibiting reverse transcriptase (1280, 3871). Reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular messengers for HIV gene expression and transcription, and the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid could inhibit this process (1562, 1563). Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation might improve blood antioxidant status and blood peroxidation products, and increase T-helper lymphocytes and T-helper to T-helper suppressor cell ratio, based on a small open trial in HIV positive patients (3885). In vitro, lipoic acid reduced the growth of Vaccinia virus by inhibiting the expression of late genes (30862).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that the alpha-lipoic acid metabolite, DHLA, in combination with vitamin E might prevent oxidative stress in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (3871, 3877). In addition, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and possibly triglycerides (100709, 104650, 115744). Also, ex vivo research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid decreases platelet reactivity in patients with type 1 diabetes, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients (30912). However, in patients with beta-thalassemia, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily does not seem to modify most of the cardiovascular risk factors measured, including homocysteine and trimethylamine-N-oxide. The effects on plasma lipids in this group of patients is not known (103329).\nChelating effects\nAlpha-lipoic acid and DHLA have been shown to chelate heavy metals (30843). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to increase the hepatobiliary excretion of an organic mercury by forming a stable complex (30819).\nEndocrine effects\nIn human research, alpha-lipoic acid improved steady state plasma insulin, glucose infusion rate, and insulin sensitivity (3545, 3876, 21657, 30840, 30863, 30941, 104660). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid restored endoneurial glucose storage (3878), appeared to prevent diabetic endothelial damage, and reduced albuminuria due to its antioxidative properties (30791, 30796, 30935). In additional animal research, alpha-lipoic acid improved muscle regeneration and aided in the redistribution of muscle fibers by stimulating glycolysis through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, which is impaired in diabetes (96230). In laboratory research, alpha-lipoic acid increased the overall glucose uptake by stimulating glucose transport via the insulin signaling pathway (3544, 3875, 3876, 30793, 30797, 30931, 30933, 30934, 30950, 96230). Alpha-lipoic acid contains high-energy bonds and functions as a coenzyme with pyrophosphate in the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-coenzyme A (Krebs cycle). As a cofactor in enzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids, alpha-lipoic acid decreases lactate and pyruvate concentrations, thus improving glucose effectiveness (3545, 3544).\n\nDHLA also appears to prevent serum albumin glycation in vitro (30928), as well as hemoglobin glycation and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes (30794).\nImmunologic effects\nThe addition of alpha-lipoic acid to peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients significantly enhanced progression of the cells through the G0/G1 to S phase, suggesting that alpha-lipoic acid may help restore the immune system in these patients (30802). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves functional reactivity of lymphocytes to T-cell mitogens in HIV patients who previously failed antiretroviral treatment (HAART) (21655).\nMetabolic effects\nCase reports indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be helpful in various inborn errors of metabolism which result in lactic acidosis (1554, 1555, 1557).\nNeurological effects\nIn some animal research, alpha-lipoic acid scavenged very-long-chain fatty acid-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in reduced oxidative stress to proteins, axonal degeneration, and locomotor impairment (30902). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid prevents nerve dysfunction by attenuating the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in diabetic rats (30885). In experimental diabetic models, alpha-lipoic acid increases neuronal blood flow, improves neuronal glucose uptake, increases amounts of reduced glutathione in neurons, and improves neuronal conduction velocity (3873, 3878). Alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial in neuropathic pain due to decreased nociceptive sensitivity, via inhibition of T-type calcium channels (112940).\nOsteoporosis effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid suppresses the development of osteoclasts, bone cells that resorb bone tissue, by directly inhibiting RANKL-RANK mediated signals, not by mediating cellular RANKL (kappaB ligand) production (30822). Other in vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human bone marrow stromal cells, which may attenuate bone loss (30824).\nVascular effects\nClinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can improve flow-mediated dilation (21656, 30715, 30851, 30881, 30884, 30896). Animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can partially restore the decline in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity that is associated with vascular dysfunction in the elderly (30807). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves endothelial dysfunction in obese rats by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells (30827). In vitro research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid downregulates proteins upregulated by and upregulates certain proteins downregulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in vascular smooth muscle cells (30810). TNF-alpha is believed to regulate cellular functions associated with the initiation and progression of vascular lesions; by attenuating the effects of TNF-alpha, alpha-lipoic acid may reduce the development of atherosclerosis.\nWeight loss effects\nIn general, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces levels of leptin and increases levels of adiponectin in patients with excess adiposity. A dysregulation in the levels of these adipocytokines in adipose tissue is thought to play a role in the development of chronic disease, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (103331, 104660). Additionally, clinical research shows that the application of an alpha-lipoic acid transdermal patch reduces triceps skinfold and subcutaneous fat thickness (115874). In an animal model, alpha-lipoic acid (0.5% weight/weight) reduces body weight and food intake. Alpha-lipoic acid also increases whole-body energy expenditure. It appears to exert its effects by suppressing hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (30814).\nWound-healing effects\nAccording to human research, the mechanisms of action behind the wound-healing effects of alpha-lipoic acid may include antioxidant effects (21677), inhibition of expression of genes for metalloproteinases, and increased expression of genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-beta, b-FGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and IL-6 (21676)."

However, the combination product does not improve most measures of respiratory function or symptoms such as cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, reduced energy levels, sleeping disorders, or activity limitations when compared with placebo (111542).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of alpinia is the rhizome (99274). Alpinia constituents include gingerols, diarylheptanoids, eucalyptol, and the flavonoid galangin (30978, 30997, 99274, 108736, 112848).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlpinia extract has shown anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory research, possibly related to inhibition of nitric oxide production (99274). The gingerol and diarylheptanoid constituents of alpinia are potent inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase. Their structures indicate they can also be active against 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme involved in leukotriene biosynthesis (6, 30997). The diarylheptanoids also inhibit the production of nitric oxide in vitro (99274).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA study in diabetes-induced rats suggests that giving alpinia 100-500 mg/kg daily for 28 days normalizes fasting blood glucose, but does not affect insulin levels when compared with control. Enhanced peripheral glucose uptake is the proposed mechanism of these effects. (112847).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAlpinia has shown broad antimicrobial activity in vitro (31006, 99274). Some constituents of alpinia possess antifungal activity in vitro (6).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn hypertensive rats, giving alpinia 250-500 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks increases serum levels of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase to a level similar to that of normotensive rats (106739). Similarly, a study in hypertensive rats suggests that giving galangin, a constituent of alpinia, 60 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks decreases superoxide and malondialdehyde levels and increases catalase levels when compared with control (112849).\nAntiulcer effects\nAnimal research suggests that alpinia has gastroprotective effects. In an indomethacin-induced gastric injury model in rats, alpinia extract limited gastric injury likely by blocking indomethacin's inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), increasing mucosal blood flow by stimulating the generation of nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, and reducing the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase expression (102093).\nBody weight effects\nIn animal research, giving alpinia 250-500 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks to rats on an obesogenic diet is associated with a reduction in body weight gain when compared with rats on the same diet without alpinia (106739).\nBurn healing effects\nIn an animal model of superficial, second-degree burns, applying a gel containing alpinia rhizome extract every 6 hours for 24 hours reduces edema, polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, collagen discoloration, and injury to blood vessels, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands in the first eight hours when compared with silver sulfadiazine cream or placebo gel (108736).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal research, giving alpinia 250-500 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks to hypertensive rats on an obesogenic diet reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. It also reduces mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (106739). Additionally, a study in hypertensive rats suggests that giving galangin, a constituent of alpinia, 30-60mg/kg daily for 4 weeks decreases blood pressure, cardiac dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy when compared with control. These effects are likely mediated through the renin-angiotensin pathway (112849).\nDiuretic effects\nIn animal research, giving alpinia 250-500 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks to hypertensive rats on an obesogenic diet has diuretic activity similar to a 10 mg/kg dose of furosemide (106739).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn animal research, giving alpinia 250-500 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks to rats on an obesogenic diet lowers liver enzyme levels and has a hepatoprotective effect (106739). A study in diabetes-induced rats suggests that giving alpinia 200-500 mg/kg daily for 28 days leads to fewer fatty and pathological changes in the liver and decreases liver enzyme and alkaline phosphatase levels when compared with control (112847).\nLipid effects\nA study in diabetes-induced rats suggests that giving alpinia 200-500 mg/kg daily for 28 days decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels when compared with control (112847).\nVasodilatory effects\nA study in hypertensive rats suggests that giving alpinia and the active component eucalyptol induces vasodilation of the mesenteric artery when compared with control. This mechanism is proposed to occur by inhibiting calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, not through endothelium or potassium channel pathways (112848)."

Similarly, two clinical trials in overweight and obese adults show that taking amaranth oil 20 mL daily for 3 weeks does not decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with either rapeseed oil 20 mL daily or no intervention (104834, 104837).

Maximum levels of nitrite occurred after approximately 0.5 hours (99230).\nDistribution\nIn humans, nitrate and nitrite levels increased in the saliva following absorption from amaranth leaf extract (99230).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of amaranth is the whole plant. The leaf contains a small amount of vitamin C and beta-carotene. The leaves from Amaranthus tricolor are a source of calcium, iron, and zinc (3833, 31057, 31065, 31080). Amaranth seed oil contains about 75% unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), including linoleic, alpha-linoleic, and oleic acids. It also contains saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic and stearic acids, with an SFA to UFA ratio of 1:3. It also contains squalene, tocopherols, and sterols (31069, 99231, 104834, 108502). Amaranth seed, used as a pseudocereal, is a good source of protein, vitamin E, antioxidant phenols, and minerals such as iron (99227, 99233, 104835). The seed of Amaranthus hypochondriacus also contains peptides, known as bioactive peptides, including lunasin, vicilin, and 11S globulin (99226, 99228, 99229). The root of Amaranthus roxburghianus contains eugenol, benzene derivatives, and 3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyran-4-one (99232). The bark of Amaranthus spinosus contains betacyanins, quercetin, kaempferol, and amaranthoside (99234).\nBlood pressure lowering effects\nIn human research, amaranth oil has been shown to decrease blood pressure, by a mechanism possibly related to increased fluidity of cell membranes (31069).\nErgogenic effects\nThere is interest in using amaranth to improve exercise performance. Theoretically, the high concentrations of nitrate in amaranth may improve muscle oxygen flow. Preliminary research in healthy adult males shows that taking 4 grams of amaranth daily for 4 days improves oxygen uptake during exercise when compared with placebo (104836).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe roots of the amaranth species Amaranthus roxburghianus are traditionally used to treat colic pain. Animal research shows that an extract of the root of this species protects against an experimental ulcerative colon. The mechanism of action may be related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of root constituents (99232). Animal research also shows that the amaranth species Amaranthus spinosus whole plant extract has laxative effects, related to cholinergic and spasmolytic mechanisms (99234). In humans, taking amaranth oil from Amaranthus cruentus seeds had antioxidant effects, preventing oxidation in the gastric mucosa (92235).\nHematologic effects\nAmaranth contains approximately 35 mg iron per 100 grams, which has led to interest in its use for the treatment or prevention of anemia. However, amaranth also contains phytic acid, which can reduce iron absorption. Clinical research suggests that using a special amaranth product that has been processed to reduce phytic acid content may reduce the prevalence of anemia in children (104835).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that the seed and oil from some species of amaranth can improve levels of liver enzymes. The hepatoprotective effects are thought to be related to its antioxidant effects (31063, 99227).\nHypoglycemic effects\nResearch in a diabetic animal model shows that amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus) seed and oil decrease serum glucose levels by a mechanism related to antioxidant effects (31061, 31063). Preliminary clinical research in obese adults shows that taking amaranth seed oil 20 mL daily for 3 weeks reduces markers of insulin resistance when compared with no intervention, but it does not appear to affect fasting blood glucose (104837). The antidiabetic and glucose lowering effects of amaranth seen in animal studies could be due to delayed glucose absorption associated with inhibition of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes (alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase) in the gut. The ethanolic amaranth extract also increases incretin-induced insulin secretion by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase IV (108500).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research suggests that amaranth seed can reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (5063). In other animal research, adding amaranth powder 10% to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks reduces total cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels in the liver and down regulates expression of lipogenesis-related genes when compared with the high-fat diet alone. Amaranth also improves gut bacterial diversity, increasing beneficial organisms such as Bifidobacteriaceae and butyrate-producing bacteria which are typically decreased by a high-fat diet (108501). Research with amaranth in humans has not found beneficial lipid effects (6188, 104834, 104837).\nMetabolic effects\nIn an animal model of metabolic syndrome, giving methanolic or aqueous extracts of amaranth aerial parts in combination with a high-carbohydrate, high-fat (HCHF) diet for 8 weeks attenuates the weight gain, increased organ weights, increased creatinine production, abdominal fat deposition, liver fat infiltration, steatosis, and increased liver function tests seen with the HCHF diet alone. The amaranth extracts also increase hepatic antioxidant levels and improve glucose tolerance and lipid parameters. They attenuate the HCHF diet-induced increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and attenuate the decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (108500). In obese humans with metabolic syndrome, amaranth oil 20 mL daily for 3 weeks has similar effects on markers of atherosclerosis, including lipids, inflammatory mediators, and glucose and insulin homeostasis when compared with rapeseed oil (108502).\nRespiratory effects\nThe amaranth species Amaranthus spinosus is traditionally used for bronchitis. Animal research shows that an extract of this species protects against bronchoconstriction, possibly by beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blocking mechanisms (99234).\nWeight loss effects\nPreliminary clinical research in obese adults shows that taking amaranth seed oil 20 mL daily for 3 weeks may modestly reduce waist circumference, but does not seem to result in additional weight loss, when compared with no intervention (104837)."

American ginseng grows mainly in North America, with much of it being produced in Ontario, Canada (29999). Wild American ginseng has been declared a threatened or endangered species in some states in the US (89403). It has been traditionally used as a diuretic or stimulant, to boost the immune system, and as an \"adaptogen.\" Adaptogens are theorized to help the body resist physiological and psychological stress.",

Oral American ginseng seems to prevent the incidence of URTIs in some people.\nSome evidence shows that taking a specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences) 200-400 mg twice daily over a 3-64 month period during influenza season might modestly decrease the risk of developing symptoms of a URTI such as the common cold or flu in adults (11351, 13192, 14345, 91275). This extract also seems to reduce symptom severity and duration of symptoms when infections do occur (13192, 14345, 91275). The extract might not reduce the chance of getting the first cold of a season, but it seems to reduce the risk of getting repeat colds in a season (13192). Additional evidence shows that, in people aged 65 years and older, treatment with the extract for 3-4 months, in addition to influenza vaccination at 4 weeks, is necessary before there is any significant reduction in the risk of developing a respiratory tract infection (14345).\n\nOne small clinical study shows that taking the extract 200 mg twice daily orally over a 12-week period during influenza season reduces the risk of laboratory confirmed influenza or influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. However, it does not seem to reduce the appearance of influenza symptoms, symptom severity, or symptom duration in these patients (11351). This same extract does not appear to prevent respiratory infections in patients who are immunocompromised. In one clinical trial, taking this extract 200 mg twice daily for 3 months did not reduce the risk of developing an acute respiratory infection, the number of days of cold symptoms, or the need for use of antibiotics when compared with placebo in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29998).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in children 3-12 years of age shows that taking the same extract 13-26 mg/kg once on the day of URTI onset, then 8.5-17 mg/kg once on the next day, then 4.5-9 mg/kg once on day three does not reduce the severity or duration of symptoms when compared with placebo. However, this study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this extract in children; therefore, it was not adequately powered to evaluate effectiveness (22365).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnemia of chronic disease. Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for anemia of chronic disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this condition.\nAntiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. It is unclear if oral American ginseng is beneficial for antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking capsules containing ground American ginseng root 1 gram three times daily for 14 days along with the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir does not reduce indinavir-induced insulin resistance when compared to baseline (89401).\nless\nAthletic performance. Early research shows that oral American ginseng does not seem to be beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking American ginseng extract 8 mg/kg or 16 mg/kg daily (average daily dose 618-1235 mg) for one week does not improve exertion, time to exhaustion, heart rate, or maximal oxygen consumption during bicycle testing when compared with placebo (4236).

Oral American ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (AD-fX, Afexa Life Sciences) containing American ginseng extract plus ginkgo leaf extract may modestly improve ADHD symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children aged 3-17 years when compared with baseline (8235). It is not clear if this effect is due to American ginseng, ginkgo, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral American ginseng is beneficial for breast cancer survival.\nPopulation research in China suggests that breast cancer patients who regularly take any form of ginseng, including either American ginseng or Panax ginseng, have higher quality of life scores and have a lower risk of overall mortality, breast cancer-related mortality, and breast cancer recurrence compared to patients who do not take ginseng (14466). However, ginseng users were also significantly more likely to have been treated with tamoxifen.\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. Clinical research on the use of oral American ginseng for cancer-related fatigue is conflicting.\nTwo clinical trials show that taking American ginseng 750-2000 mg in 1-2 divided doses daily for 8 weeks does not reduce cancer-related fatigue when compared with placebo (22370, 104131). However, another clinical trial shows that taking American ginseng 1000 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces cancer-related fatigue scores by 51%, compared to 25% in those taking placebo (29996). These differing findings may be due to the instrument used to measure fatigue. The initial studies used the Brief Fatigue Inventory, whereas the positive study used the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF). Additionally, treatment for a shorter duration of only 4 weeks does not appear to be effective (22370, 29996, 104131).\n\nBased on this conflicting low- to moderate-quality research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) joint clinical practice guidelines states that American ginseng may be recommended to help manage the symptoms of cancer-related fatigue in adults undergoing active cancer treatment (116230).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral American ginseng is beneficial for cognitive function.\nClinical research shows that a single dose of a specific American ginseng extract (Cereboost, Naturex) 100-400 mg, taken 1-6 hours prior to cognitive testing, improves short-term working memory performance and may improve reaction time accuracy when compared with placebo in healthy young adults (22367). Other clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking the same specific American ginseng extract, standardized to contain 10% to 12% ginsenosides, as 200 mg orally daily for 14 days modestly improves memory and mental fatigue scores when compared with placebo (109518).\n\nAmerican ginseng has also been studied in combination with bacopa and coffee fruit extract. One small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of American ginseng (Cereboost) 100 mg, bacopa 300 mg, and coffee fruit extract 100 mg modestly improves some, but not all, measures of working memory and attention after 45 minutes when compared with placebo (103375). Another small clinical study in healthy adults evaluated the effects of this same ingredient combination (CopaPrime+. USANA Health Sciences) when taken daily for 4 weeks. When compared with placebo, this combination modestly improves positive affect, but does not affect working memory, attention, inhibition, mood, or social-emotional measures (116229). It is unclear if any acute or chronic effects are due to American ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral American ginseng is beneficial for diabetes.\nTwo small clinical trials show that taking American ginseng 3 grams orally, up to two hours before a meal, can significantly reduce postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo (1018, 6461). However, doses greater than 3 grams do not seem to offer any additional benefit (6461). In addition, the postprandial glucose lowering effect of American ginseng may differ among preparations due to variations in the concentration of ginsenosides (9732).\n\nAmerican ginseng has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking American ginseng 1500 mg and Panax ginseng 750 mg, enriched to contain 30% total ginsenosides, orally daily for 12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin by 0.35% when compared with placebo. Taking this combination also reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by about 4 mmHg when compared with placebo (107745). It is unclear if this effect is due American ginseng, Panax ginseng, or the combination.\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this condition.\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for headaches, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this purpose.\nHeart failure. It is unclear if American ginseng is beneficial in adults with heart failure.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in adults with heart failure at varying levels of severity shows that adding an American ginseng saponin extract to conventional heart failure treatment for 1-6 months modestly improves left ventricular ejection fraction and 6-minute walking distance when compared with conventional treatment alone (116231).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this condition.\nHypertension. Evidence on the use of oral American ginseng for hypertension is conflicting.\nSome clinical research shows that taking American ginseng 1500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with hypertension (22368, 22369). However, other clinical research shows that taking American ginseng extract 1000 mg three times daily for 12 weeks lowers systolic blood pressure by 12% when compared with baseline in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (29999).\n\nIn a similar study in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, American ginseng extract 500 mg in combination with Panax ginseng extract 250 mg three times daily for 12 weeks, providing 30% total ginsenosides daily, reduces central systolic blood pressure by about 5 mmHg, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo (103046). These differing results may be due to the higher amount of total ginsenosides provided in the latter study.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral American ginseng has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research during pre- and post-menopause shows that taking a specific combination product (Phyto-Female Complex, SupHerb) containing black cohosh root extract 100 mg, dong quai root extract 75 mg, milk thistle extract 75 mg, red clover flower extract 50 mg, American ginseng root extract 50 mg, and vitex agnus-castus fruit extract 50 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves sleep quality and reduces menopausal symptoms, including the number and intensity of hot flashes and the number of night sweats, when compared with placebo (19552). However, it is unclear whether these effects are due to American ginseng, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral American ginseng is beneficial for schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with schizophrenia who are taking antipsychotics shows that taking a specific American ginseng extract (HT1001, Afexa Life Sciences) 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks modestly increases visual working memory score when compared with placebo. This treatment also reduces physical symptoms associated with antipsychotic use, such as abnormal gait or muscle rigidity. However, it does not appear to improve other clinical symptoms or parameters related to cognitive function, such as verbal working memory, sustained attention, verbal function, or immediate or delayed auditory memory, when compared with placebo (29997).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Although there has been interest in using oral American ginseng for ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of American ginseng for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate American ginseng for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with American ginseng.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral intake in healthy volunteers, the peak plasma concentration of Rb1, an American ginseng constituent, is 19.9 ± 5.43 ng/mL. This concentration occurs approximately 4 hours post-ingestion (89404). Compound K, the primary metabolite of ginsenoside Rb1, is detected in the plasma at 7 hours post-ingestion (89404).\nMetabolism\nWhen taken orally by healthy volunteers, constituents of American ginseng appear to be metabolized by intestinal microbiota. The American ginseng constituent ginsenoside Rb1 is metabolized in the gut to ginsenoside Rd, F2, and the primary metabolite compound K (89404).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of American ginseng is the root. American ginseng contains triterpene saponins, more commonly called ginsenosides. The six most abundant ginsenosides in American ginseng are Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rg1 (13615). At least 30 ginsenosides are known to exist in varying concentrations in the assorted species of ginseng (9735, 12536). American ginseng contains higher amounts of Rb1, Re, Rc, and Rd relative to other ginsengs, and lesser amounts of Rb2 and Rg1. The individual ginsenosides have been reported to have opposing effects. For example, Rg1 has been reported to stimulate angiogenesis, while Rb1 seems to inhibit angiogenesis (14802).\n\nAmerican ginseng also contains polysaccharides (13615). Nonsaponin peptidoglycan constituents called quinquefolans appear to have hypoglycemic effects (12536).\nAntidiabetic effects\nFor diabetes, ginsenosides and possibly other constituents are thought to reduce postprandial glucose levels. This effect might be due to either tissue insulin sensitization or direct stimulation of insulin release or both of these mechanisms (6461). The effect of various ginsengs on glucose appears to be related in part to the mix of ginsenosides. Other nonginsenoside constituents likely affect blood glucose as well. Panax ginseng and other ginsengs contain protopanaxadiol (PPD) ginsenosides, Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd. They also contain protopanaxatriol (PPT) ginsenosides, Rg1, Re, and Rf. A higher ratio of PPD ginsenosides to PPT ginsenosides is related to greater blood glucose and insulin lowering potency of the ginseng product. Compared with Panax ginseng, American ginseng appears to have a higher PPD to PPT ratio and may have greater blood glucose and insulin lowering potency. There appears to be some differences in the PPD to PPT ratio between wild and cultivated American ginseng. The ginsenoside content also varies among batches, plant parts, and preparation methods (12536).\nCardiovascular effects\nLaboratory research suggests that saponins found in the stems and leaves of American ginseng can reduce oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These saponins might reverse the decrease in venous relaxation in response to acetylcholine that occurs in the presence of oxidized LDL (9733). A hot water extract of American ginseng root seems to decrease endothelial constriction by promoting the release of nitric oxide (9734).\nEstrogenic effects\nSome American ginseng extracts appear to have estrogenic activity. Animal research shows that an American ginseng extract decreases luteinizing hormone levels and increases serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity (a measure of estrogenic activity in the liver) (6180). In vitro research shows that American ginseng extract might reduce breast cancer cell growth (389); however, this effect may be outweighed by its estrogenic action, which might increase the growth of breast cancer cells (7860, 10984, 15268). The ginsenoside constituents of American ginseng are thought to be responsible for the estrogenic activity (10984). American ginseng extracts that contain no ginsenosides or contain only a low concentration of ginsenosides do not appear to have estrogenic activity (15268).\nImmune effects\nAmerican ginseng seems to have immunomodulatory activity. Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides from ginseng are thought to be responsible for the immunomodulating effects (11351). American ginseng seems to activate monocytes, induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma. It also stimulates natural killer cell activity, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and other factors involved in cell-mediated immunity (7602, 11351, 13611). It also seems to stimulate B-lymphocyte proliferation, serum immunoglobulin production and macrophage production of IL-1 and IL-6 (13612). Some researchers suggest that this apparent immunomodulating activity might offer protection from upper respiratory tract infections, but how this relates to viral respiratory infections such as cold or influenza is not clear. Although increased gamma-interferon has been associated with improvement of upper respiratory tract infection, enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin and tumor necrosis factor might increase the severity of cold and flu symptoms (13613, 13614).\nNeurologic effects\nGinsenosides might improve memory by influencing the effect of acetylcholine in the central nervous system by an unknown mechanism. Ginsenosides do not appear to change metabolism, release, or reuptake of acetylcholine (9736). There's also some evidence that ginsenosides might cause an increase in sexual drive (11162)."

Absorption of andarine after oral administration is rapid (100006).\nMetabolism\nAndarine, like other selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM), is rapidly metabolized via phase I and II pathways. Sulphated and glucuronidated compounds are the main metabolites. In humans, glucuronidation seems to be predominant, whereas sulphation is predominant in horses (100008).\nExcretion\nAndarine is slowly cleared from plasma with a half-life of 2.6 to 5.3 hours (100006). Andarine and its metabolites are excreted in urine. Unchanged andarine is found in very small amounts in the urine (100003, 100006).",

It is in the arylpropionamide class of SARMs (100003, 100008).\nAndrogenic effects\nAndarine is purported to selectively bind to the androgen receptor without reacting with other nuclear hormone receptors. This is thought to be an advantage of andarine and other SARMs over steroidal androgens, which can affect other tissues (100007). Andarine binds only to androgen receptors and does not react with steroid hormone receptors or act as a substrate for aromatases (100004). In animal studies, andarine improved muscle mass, muscle strength, and bone density by having a strong effect on the production of osteoblast cells (100004, 100005, 100007). However, andarine had only weak androgenic effects on other androgen-sensitive tissues, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, demonstrating only small effects on levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) when compared with testosterone (100005, 100007). Researchers believe these properties allow for beneficial effects on skeletal muscle without the safety concerns of steroidal androgens."

Gedunin and its derivatives are thought to be the active compounds (99972).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nIn animal research, fatty acid amides synthesized from andiroba oil by combination with ethanolamine extend the time to seizure onset and reduce the duration of tonic-clonic seizures when compared with the vehicle alone. This anticonvulsant effect is blocked by flumazenil, suggesting that the fatty acid amides are agonists at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors (109903).\nInsect repellent effects\nAndiroba seed oil is used topically or in oil lamps, candles, and soap to repel mosquitoes and other insects. Andiroba seed oil also has larvicidal effects against mosquitoes. At lower doses, pupae and adult emergence are prevented (99970). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and beta-photogedunin, isolated from andiroba seeds, affect larval and/or pupal development of the fall armyworm moth. However, these derivatives are less effective than gedunin (99971).\nWound healing effects\nAndiroba leaves are used for various skin conditions, including ulcers and wounds.

Oral andrographis, taken alone or as part of a specific combination product (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) also containing eleuthero, seems to improve symptoms of the common cold. It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial for preventing the common cold.\nMost clinical research shows that taking andrographis alone or as part of a combination herbal supplement improves cold symptoms (2744, 2773, 2774, 5784, 10795, 12380, 12381, 31222, 98222, 114097). A large clinical study in adults with the common cold shows that taking a specific andrographis extract (AP Bio®/KalmCold®, Natural Remedies Private Ltd) 100 or 200 mg twice daily for 7 days reduces cold symptoms on day 3, but not days 5 and 7, when compared with placebo (114097). Similarly, other clinical research shows that taking this same extract 200 mg daily for 5 days reduces cold symptoms by approximately two-fold and increases the number of patients who respond to treatment when compared with placebo (31222).\n\nTaking a specific combination product (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) containing andrographis extract, standardized to andrographolides 4-5.6 mg, and eleuthero three times daily seems to improve symptoms of the common cold when started within 72 hours of symptom onset. Some symptoms can improve after 2 days of treatment, but it typically takes 4-5 days of treatment for maximal symptom relief (2744, 2773, 2774, 5784, 10795, 12380). This combination also seems to relieve cold symptoms better than echinacea or placebo in children (12381).\n\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking andrographis (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) prophylactically might decrease the risk of developing a cold by about 50% after 2 months of continuous treatment (2772); however, more evidence is needed to confirm these results.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral andrographis extract has been evaluated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, with promising results.\nIn patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee, clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of andrographis extract (ParActin, HP Ingredients) 300 mg and 600 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces pain and stiffness by approximately 40% and 46%, respectively, compared with changes of less than 10% with placebo (101116).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral andrographis extract has been evaluated for the management of ulcerative colitis symptoms, with promising results.\nSome clinical research shows that taking andrographis extract 1200-1800 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, but does not affect remission rates, when compared with placebo (31231). Additional clinical research also shows that taking andrographis extract 1200 mg daily for 8 weeks is as effective as mesalamine for reducing symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis (31223).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical studies suggest that adding andrographis extract to standard of care does not improve outcomes in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19.\nA clinical study in adults in Thailand receiving treatment with favipiravir for mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that adding andrographis extract, providing andrographolide 60 mg, 3 times daily for 5 days does not prevent disease progression, improve symptoms, or reduce hospitalizations, mortality, or the need for supplemental oxygen when compared with placebo (114099). Another clinical study in adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking the same dose of andrographis extract does not affect disease progression or overall symptoms when compared with placebo (116090). Additionally, a large observational study of unvaccinated adults hospitalized in Thailand for mild COVID-19 has found that adding this andrographis extract regimen to standard of care is not associated with the risk of developing pneumonia when compared with standard of care alone (112919).\n\nAndrographis has also been evaluated in combination with other herbal ingredients. A clinical study in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking a specific combination product (Kan Jang ®, Swiss Herbal Institute) containing andrographis extract 520 mg, standardized to 30 mg andrographolides, and eleuthero 3 times daily for 14 days modestly decreases the rate of clinical deterioration, symptom severity, and recovery time when compared with placebo (114094). The validity of this finding is limited by the withdrawal of 7% of patients from the placebo group due to disease progression; these patients were not included in assessment of outcomes. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to andrographis, eleuthero, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute bronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral andrographis for acute bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of andrographis for this purpose.\nCognitive impairment. Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in a small number of patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a combination product (Adaptra Forte, Europharma USA) containing andrographis extract 400 mg, standardized to andrographolides 40 mg, and ashwagandha extract 150 mg twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves some measures of concentration and sleep quality when compared with placebo (104822).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes who are taking metformin 1000 mg daily shows that taking a combination product containing andrographis and Syzygium polyanthum leaf extracts, 900 mg daily for 8 weeks, does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, or blood lipid levels when compared with placebo (101117).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial in adults with esophageal cancer.\nA small single-arm, open-label study in adults with metastatic esophageal cancer receiving palliative care shows that taking andrographis extract granules 130 mg/kg daily for 4 months reduces dysphagia and improves quality of life when compared with those who could not complete their course of andrographis treatment (114100). However, the appropriateness of comparing treatment completers to those who were unable to complete the treatment is unclear; 65% of patients who did not complete treatment passed away prior to study completion, suggesting that any differences in dysphagia or quality of life may have been unrelated to andrographis treatment.\nless\nFamilial Mediterranean fever. Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children 3-15 years of age shows that taking a combination product (ImmunoGuard, Inspired Nutritionals) containing andrographis 16 mg, eleuthero, schisandra, and licorice daily for 1 month reduces the duration, frequency, and severity of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (12382).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nA small clinical study in adults with hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking andrographis, standardized to contain andrographolide 119.64-120.36 mg, by mouth daily for 8 weeks decreases triglycerides by 42 mg/dL, demonstrating comparable effects to gemfibrozil. However, compared to baseline, total cholesterol was increased by 15 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was increased by 21 mg/dL, suggesting that the benefits of lower triglycerides may be offset by elevations in other lipid levels. Taking a lower daily dose of andrographis, standardized to contain andrographolide 71.64-72.36 mg, does not seem to affect lipid levels (91839).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small crossover clinical study in adults with prediabetes conducted in Indonesia shows that taking andrographis 550 mg for 14 days increases glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels but does not statistically improve measures of insulin resistance (i.e., fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, 2-hour postprandial insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) when compared with placebo (112918). However, it is unclear whether this improvement is clinically significant. In addition, the frequency of andrographis dosing is unclear.\nless\nInfluenza. Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that patients with influenza who take a specific product (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) containing andrographis extract, standardized to andrographolides 4-5.6 mg, and eleuthero three times daily for 3-5 days have more rapid symptom relief when compared with patients taking amantadine. Taking this combination product also seems to reduce the risk of post-influenza complications such as rhinosinusitis or bronchitis when compared with amantadine (10441).\nless\nMalaria. It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial for treating malaria.\nAn open-label, single-arm study in adolescents and adults with malaria in Indonesia shows that taking andrographis ethanolic extract 250 mg three times daily for 5 days is associated with clinical and parasitological resolution in approximately 94% of cases (114093). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMigraine headache. Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nResearch has evaluated a combination product (Vivinor, Brain Therapeutics; Partena, FB Health) containing andrographis 100 mg, magnesium 281 mg, riboflavin 5 mg, feverfew 150 mg, and coenzyme Q10 20 mg. A nonblinded, clinical study in patients with episodic migraines shows that taking 1-2 tablets of this product daily for 3 months decreases monthly average migraine days, migraine severity, and the number of days an acute migraine medication is used when compared with baseline. In the third month of treatment, 57% of patients had at least a 50% reduction in average migraine days (107473). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of randomization and placebo-control; additionally, it is unclear if any effects are due to andrographis, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial in patients with MS.\nA small clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS currently receiving interferon-beta shows that taking andrographis dried extract (Innobioscience Spa) 170 mg, standardized to contain andrographolides 85 mg, twice daily for 12 months decreases fatigue by 44%, but does not affect relapse rate or disability, when compared with placebo (91838). Another small clinical study of patients with primary or secondary, but not active, progressive MS shows that taking andrographolide, a constituent of andrographis, 140 mg twice daily for 24 months slows the progression of disability when compared with placebo (104821).\nless\nPharyngitis. It is unclear if topical andrographis throat spray is beneficial for acute sore throat in adults.\nA clinical study in adults with acute pharyngitis shows that applying two sprays of andrographis 0.3% throat spray 3 times daily for 5 days reduces pharyngeal erythema and throat pain severity similarly to a chamomile throat spray; people using the andrographis throat spray recovered about one day sooner, on average, than those using the chamomile-based spray (114096). It is unclear if any changes are due to the treatment or natural resolution of the condition. Additionally, the reportedly bitter taste of the andrographis throat spray may have compromised the double-blind design of this study.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral andrographis is beneficial in patients with RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking andrographis extract 90 mg daily for 14 weeks reduces symptoms of RA when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (31220).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Although there has been interest in using oral andrographis for rhinosinusitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of andrographis for this purpose.\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Oral andrographis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in adults with uncomplicated URTI shows that a specific combination product (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) containing andrographis 195 mg and eleuthero root 11.4 mg per capsule, taken as two capsules three times daily for 5 days, reduces the median number of sick leave days to 2 days, compared with 3 days in the placebo group. It also increases the total number of recovered patients on day 3 to 75%, compared with 55% of those taking placebo (107471).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate andrographis for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nAndrographis has been used in doses of up to 6 grams daily for up to 7 days. Andrographis extract has most often been used at doses between 90 mg and 600 mg daily when used for longer periods, up to 12 weeks. A specific combination product containing andrographis extract 178-266 mg, standardized to andrographolide 4-5.6 mg, and eleuthero (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) has typically been taken three times daily for 4-7 days. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nAndrographis extracts are typically standardized to andrographolide content, with concentrations ranging from 2% to 50% (2744, 2748, 2773, 2774, 31213, 31222, 101116, 10441, 10795, 13016).\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost clinical studies have tested products standardized to the andrographolide fraction.

One product is a single herb preparation containing the extract SHA-10, which is standardized to contain andrographolide and deoxyandrographolide 5.25 mg per tablet. The other product combines the same standardized quantity of SHA-10 with the eleuthero extract, SHE-3 (2744, 31213).\n\nOne marketed product (KalmCold) contains >30.0% w/w andrographolide, >0.30% w/w isoandrographolide, >1.0% w/w neoandrographolide, >0.30% w/w andrograpanin, >0.05% w/w skullcap flavone I, >0.05% w/w 7-0-methylwogonin, and ≥5.0% w/w 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (31222). Another extract (ParActin) contains 50% andrographolide, composed of approximately 3% 14-deoxyandrographolide and 0.2% neoandrographolide by weight (101116).",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with andrographis.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn clinical research, maximum plasma levels of andrographolide are reached between 0.65 to 2 hours after oral intake (31202, 114095) and maximum plasma levels of other constituents, including 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide, and 14-deoxyandrographolide, are reached about 1-1.5 hours after oral intake (114095, 114098).\nDistribution\nAndrographolide appears to be about 55% bound to plasma proteins (31202).\nMetabolism\nAndrographolide appears to be metabolized in a dose-dependent fashion (31202, 31219, 114095) via phase II metabolism, yielding conjugated glucuronide and sulfate metabolites (114095, 114098). The peak plasma levels of andrographolide conjugated metabolites occur about 1-1.5 hours after oral intake; the elimination half-life of these conjugated metabolites is approximately 5-7.5 hours during single dose administration and 1.5-3 hours after multiple doses. The area under the curves of these andrographalide metabolites are 10-100 times higher than the parent compounds (114095, 114098).\nExcretion\nIn one study of an andrographis extract, the elimination half-life of oral andrographolide 20 mg was approximately 6.6 hours (31202); in a separate study of an aqueous extract providing 60 mg or 120 mg andrographolide, the elimination half-life was about 1.2 hours. When 60 mg or 120 mg andrographolide was taken for 3 consecutive days, the half-life increased to 2.3 and 1.7 hours, respectively (114095). This study also shows that the elimination half-life of other constituents, including 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide, and 14-deoxyandrographolide, is 1.6-3 hours, 0.2-0.6 hours, and about 0.2 hours, respectively, after single or multiple doses (114095). Most research suggests that andrographis is only partially renally eliminated (31230, 114095). The conjugated metabolites of andrographis are also excreted via the hepatobiliary system. Multiple and single dosing studies indicate that excretion is dose-dependent (114095, 114098).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of andrographis are the leaf and rhizome (12, 2758, 2767). Several active constituents have been identified, including andrographolide, deoxyandrographolide, neoandrographolide, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, and other diterpenes (2750, 2760, 2768, 2771, 31214, 31215, 31216, 31224, 31227, 31230)(114095, 114098).\nAbortifacient effects\nAndrographis is reported to have abortifacient activity. The mechanism of abortifacient action is unknown (2771). Preliminary evidence suggests that andrographis might also have detrimental effects on male and female fertility. In animals, andrographis decreased fertility of both males and females (2769, 2770, 2776); however, this has not been demonstrated in humans.\nAnalgesic effects\nPossible analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-ulcerogenic effects of andrographis have been described (2753, 2754, 31240).\nAnti-HIV effects\nPeople use andrographis for HIV/AIDS because some of its constituents have been found to have anti-HIV activity in vitro (2765). High doses of the purified andrographolide constituent can also increase CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients. Andrographolide is thought to work through correction of T-lymphocyte function rather than by direct inhibition of viral replication (6767).\nAnti-inflammatory\nAndrographis has been used for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis due to its potential anti-inflammatory properties (31220, 91838). Andrographis and its active ingredient andrographolide have shown anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo, such as reducing the expression of the inflammatory protein COX-2 (31209, 31210, 31200, 31227, 31238).\nAntibacterial effects\nAndrographis has traditionally been used for infectious diseases. Antibacterial activity was not detected by one group of investigators, but preliminary evidence suggests potential use against bacteria in raw water, human roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), Toxoplasma gondii, malaria, and E. coli enterotoxin secretion (2752, 2753, 2764, 2767, 2777, 2779, 2780, 2781).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAndrographis has been used traditionally for diabetes. Early evidence suggests that andrographis has hypoglycemic effects, possibly by slowing glucose absorption from the gut (31235) or by stimulating insulin release (31218). Additionally, a crossover clinical study in healthy and prediabetic patients shows that taking andrographis may increase glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels without decreasing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) enzyme concentrations (112918). However, this study did not perform substrate-enzyme analysis to corroborate whether andrographis inhibits DDP-IV enzyme.\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is interest in using andrographis as an anticancer agent. Extracts of andrographis inhibit proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro. This activity has been attributed to the diterpine constituents andrographolide, deoxyandrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide. The andrographolide constituent also inhibits proliferation of breast, brain, lung, skin, ovarian, prostate, and renal cancer cells in vitro (10302, 31212, 31211, 31216, 31226, 31227).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that andrographis and its active ingredient andrographolide may inhibit platelet aggregation (2758, 2759, 31232).\nAntipyretic effects\nPossible antipyretic effects of andrographis have been described (2753, 2754, 31240).\n\nAndrographis might also have leukemia cell differentiation-inducing activity (2766, 2768).\nAntiviral effects\nAndrographis has in-vitro activity against avian influenza A and human influenza A H1N1 viruses, possibly by preventing binding of viral hemagglutinin to cells (98222).\nCardiovascular effects\nAndrographis may be beneficial in cardiovascular disease. Early evidence suggests that andrographis might lower blood pressure, prevent arteriosclerosis, inhibit platelet aggregation, prevent re-stenosis, and reduce myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (2755, 2756, 2757, 2758, 2759, 2760, 2782, 2783, 31236, 31237).\nDrug metabolism effects\nPreliminary research shows conflicting effects of andrographis and andrographolide extracts on cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes. Some preliminary studies show that a specific andrographis extract induces CYP1A2 enzymes while others show that this extract inhibits them. Preliminary studies in human hepatocytes suggest that an ethanolic extract of andrographis modestly inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP1A2, but not CYP3A4 enzymes. Further preliminary studies show that andrographis extracts do not inhibit CYP2C9, but do weakly inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities. Andrographis extracts seems to consistently inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 mRNA transcription, however the clinical significance of this is not known. Notably, in vitro findings show that andrographis consistently lacks induction effects on liver enzymes (91842). Until more studies using the same methodology show consistent effects, it cannot be concluded if andrographis enzymes inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes.\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn adults with metastatic esophageal cancer, a small clinical study shows that taking andrographis daily for 6 months may alter the gut microbiome to a state that more closely resembles that of healthy adults (114100).\nHepatic effects\nAndrographis might protect the liver against hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., acetaminophen) and chemicals, possibly by increasing bile flow, bile salt, and bile acids (2761, 2762, 2763, 2778). The andrographis constituent, andrographolide, is a more potent hepatoprotectant than silymarin, an active constituent of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) (2762, 2778, 31217, 31225).\nImmunomodulatory properties\nAndrographis has traditionally been proposed to have immunostimulant properties. There is some preliminary evidence that it might increase antibody activity and phagocytosis by macrophages (2766). Preliminary evidence also suggests that andrographis might have mast cell-stabilizing and antiallergy activity (2750, 2751). Some clinical research suggests that andrographis, when used alone or in combination with other ingredients, may help to reduce the symptoms of the common cold (2744, 2773, 2774, 5784, 10795, 12380, 12381, 98222). Also, one small, nonblinded study in healthy patients with lymphocyte counts between 1000-4000 cells/mm3 shows that taking a specific formulation of oral andrographis (AP-Bio/KalmCold) 100 mg twice daily for 30 days modestly increases levels of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, T cells, and T helper cells, and decreases levels of IL-2 when compared with baselines (107784). Clinical research in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also shows that taking andrographis reduces IL-1beta (114099)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Androstenedione is a precursor to testosterone, estrogen, and other androgens. It is naturally produced in the body in the adrenal glands and gonads. In men, most androstenedione comes from the testes (6000, 97841, 97843, 97844, 111132, 111133).",
            "Warnings": "In March 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told manufacturers of dietary supplements containing androstenedione to immediately stop distribution. Dietary supplements containing androstenedione are considered by the FDA to be adulterated drugs due the lack of historical data regarding dietary use that establishes a reasonable expectation of safety. There are concerns that these products are unsafe. Androstenedione might have potent androgenic effects and lead to serious side effects including impotence, liver problems, and increased cancer risk (12001). In January 2005, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 went into effect in the US. This reclassified androstenedione from a dietary supplement to an anabolic steroid, which is a schedule III controlled substance (8639). Androstenedione is considered a banned substance by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) (13163).\n\nConcerns about adulteration of supplements used for muscle strength and athletic performance with androstenedione exist. One laboratory analysis of 30 different protein- or creatine-based supplements without androstenedione listed on the label found that 11 (37%) products contained detectable quantities of androstenedione (111133).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. Androstenedione has been associated with significant side effects, including increased risk of breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (672, 3861, 6000). In addition, there are safety concerns that the potency and purity of androstenedione products can differ significantly from the product labeling (10641).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Androstenedione could potentially cause premature closure of the bone growth plates and precocious puberty (674, 111132).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally.

It is a precursor to estrone and testosterone (6000, 97841, 97843, 97844, 111132, 111133). Production of androstenedione peaks in the mid-twenties and declines steadily after age 30 (1365).\nBody building effects\nPeople use androstenedione as an alternative to anabolic steroids to improve athletic performance and build muscle. Androstenedione does not seem to have anabolic effects and does not significantly affect markers of muscle anabolism or growth; or increase lean body mass or physical strength (1365, 1905, 3862, 6000, 7236, 7514).

In mainly younger men, use for less than one month can sometimes increase testosterone levels (1905, 3861, 10696); however, with continued use, testosterone levels return to normal (1365, 1905, 6000, 7236, 7514, 10696). In women, androstenedione can increase testosterone levels (19563, 19564, 111132). When androstenedione is used for longer than one month, luteinizing hormone secretion seems to decline by about a third, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations rise (1905, 8138, 10696). This suggests androstenedione might actually down-regulate testosterone synthesis (1905, 10696).\n\nAndrostenedione increases estrogen levels in the majority of human research in both men and women, possibly resulting in an increased risk of estrogenic side effects (1905, 3861, 6000, 7236, 8138, 97845, 111132, 111134)."

Angelica archangelica contains essential oils, phytosterols, caffeic acid derivatives, and flavonoids (18). It also contains furanocoumarin constituents, including angelicin, bergapten, imperatorin, and xanthotoxin, which can be photosensitizing (13401, 13405, 13406, 92458). Essential oils and furanocoumarins from the leaves have a strong irritant effect on the skin and mucous membranes (18).\nAnti-cancer effects\nAn ethanolic extract of Angelica archangelica fruit that contains furanocoumarins, imperatorin, and xanthotoxin seems to have an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells (13401). Angelica archangelica leaf extract also seems to have antiproliferative and antitumor effects, possibly due in part to its xanthotoxin content (13402).\nAnti-fungal effects\nA mixture of Angelica archangelica essential oil, phenyl ethyl alcohol, and alpha-terpineol has demonstrated anti-fungal effects against Aspergillus species (92460).\nAnti-hypertensive effects\nAdministration of Angelica archangelica extract appears to prevent increases in blood pressure and stress-induced hypertension in rats fed a high fat diet as indicated by a reduction in systolic blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the hypothalamus (110632).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research suggests that Angelica archangelica has antioxidant activity and might protect the liver from chronic alcohol toxicity. Angelica archangelica extracts seem to have an inhibitory effect on membrane lipid peroxidation and free radical formation, and may have free radical scavenging activity (13403).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn animal research, Angelica archangelica extract has anxiolytic effects. The root appears to contain the constituents with the most benefit (92370). The non-polar coumarin, imperatorin, also appears to have anxiolytic effects; however, the most benefit is achieved with a mixture of non-polar constituents (92458).\nCognitive effects\nA constituent of Angelica archangelica called decursin is thought to be beneficial for dementia. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, inhibits apoptosis, has neuroprotective effects in animals, and inhibits acetylcholinesterase (106409).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn laboratory research, Angelica archangelica seems to reduce slow wave frequency and amplitude in the small intestine, which slows peristaltic movement (13398).\nGlycemic effects\nAdministration of Angelica archangelica extract appears to improve blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance in rats induced into a metabolic syndrome-like state (110632). The underlying mechanism of these effects is unclear.\nPlatelet effects\nThe angelol-type coumarins in Angelica archangelica can inhibit human platelet aggregation in vitro (736)."

Angel's trumpet is hallucinogenic and toxic (5625, 5626).",
            "Safety": "UNSAFE when used orally. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids and are considered poisonous (5624, 5625, 5627). The foliage and seeds contain the highest concentration of toxic alkaloids (5627). Seizures, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, respiratory distress, acute cholinergic syndrome, and death have been reported (5624, 5625, 5626, 5627, 31290, 31291, 31293, 31297, 31301, 97759).\nCHILDREN: UNSAFE when used orally (5624, 5625, 5626, 5627, 97759, 97761).

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nAngel's trumpet is generally regarded as unsafe for use. Any benefits of therapy may not outweigh the risk of toxicity. Orally, angel's trumpet can cause acute anticholinergic poisoning requiring medical attention (5624, 5625, 5626, 5627, 31300, 97759). Angel's trumpet can cause neurologic toxicity, including delirium, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, disorientation (5624, 5625, 31289, 31290, 31293, 31300, 97759), audio-visual disassociation (5627), hyperexcitability, visual hallucinations, anxiety, amnesia, combativeness, ataxia, clonus, muscular weakness, expressive aphasia, muscular paralysis, seizure (5624, 5625, 31289, 31291, 31296, 31299, 31300, 97759), alternating levels of consciousness, convulsions, and coma (5624, 5625). Additional symptoms of toxicity include intense thirst, dry skin and mucous membranes, flushing of the skin, fever, widened pulse pressure, systolic hypertension, tachycardia, urinary retention, and decreased GI motility (5624, 5625, 5627, 31289, 31290, 31293, 31300, 97759). Death due to angel's trumpet toxicity is rare and typically results from respiratory arrest or self-inflicted injury or exposure as a result of hallucinations (5624, 31291, 31299, 97759). Toxic effects have occurred in individuals consuming tea brewed from the flowers, ingestion of the flowers or another part of the plant, or ingestion of juice from the plant (97759). Reports suggest that ingestion of tea made from 3-6 flowers can produce hallucinations, and 9 flowers can produce total paralysis (5624). The tea results in a rapid and complete absorption of alkaloids (97759).\n\nTopically, pupil enlargement and blurred vision have occurred (102693).\n\nInhalation of the smoke from burning leaves of angel's trumpet has been reported to cause anticholinergic poisoning adverse effects (97759).\nCardiovascular\nOrally and via inhalation, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. Cardiovascular symptoms include tachycardia and arrhythmias (31296, 31293, 31300, 5625, 109906), widened pulse pressure (5625, 31300), and hypertension or hypotension (5625, 31293, 31300, 109906). Tachycardia usually resolves within 5 hours (97759).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally and via inhalation, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. Dermatologic symptoms include dry skin and mucous membranes, and flushing (5625, 31300).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. Gastrointestinal symptoms include vomiting (31296), intense thirst, and decreased gastrointestinal motility (5627).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally and via inhalation, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. Genitourinary symptoms include urinary retention (5625, 31300).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally and via inhalation, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. Musculoskeletal symptoms include hypertonia, motor restlessness (31296), muscular weakness (5625, 31300), and muscular paralysis (5625, 31300).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally and via inhalation, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity. The most common neurologic symptoms include acute encephalopathy, delirium, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, and disorientation. Delirium and dilated pupils typically last for about 16 hours and 30 hours after ingestion, respectively (97759, 109906). Other neurologic symptoms include audio-visual dissociation (5627), hyperexcitability, visual hallucinations, anxiety, amnesia, combativeness, ataxia, clonus, muscular weakness, expressive aphasia, muscular paralysis, seizure (5624, 5625, 31289, 31291, 31296, 31299, 31300, 97759), alternating levels of consciousness, convulsions, and coma (5624, 5625). Death may occur due to cerebral anoxia (109906). Hallucinations have led to self-amputations and accidents (31296, 97759).\n\nIn one case report, a 5-year-old child was diagnosed with acute motor axonal neuropathy-type Guillain-Barre syndrome likely associated with accidental ingestion of angel's trumpet flowers, which were thought to have triggered an immune reaction against myelin on the peripheral nerves, although no diagnostic tests were performed (97760, 97761). Treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin did not improve symptoms (97761). The patient presented with rapid and shallow breathing, dry mouth with inflamed oral mucosa, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and muscle weakness, and progressed to flaccid paralysis with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for 35 days (97761).\n\nIn another case of accidental angel's trumpet flower ingestion, a 76-year-old female was found in a stuporous state, with head trauma, tachycardia, and moderate thrombocytopenia. The next day the patient developed vomiting, bilateral mydriasis, aphasia, confusion, and hypertension, which all resolved within 48 hours. Chronic complications included ischemic encephalopathy with electroencephalogram abnormalities and two small subcortical stroke-like lesions (109906).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nTopically, there is a case report of pupil enlargement and blurred vision in one eye of a 10-year-old female due to accidental contact with angel's trumpet sap. The eye recovered without treatment (102693). At toxic levels, angel's trumpet can cause severe vision disorders (109906).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity, including respiratory distress and respiratory arrest (31297).\nless\nOther\nOrally, angel's trumpet can cause severe toxicity, rarely resulting in death. Deaths have been due to respiratory arrest, as well as self-inflicted injury or exposure as a result of hallucinations (31291, 31299, 97759). In most cases of angel's trumpet poisoning, the actual amount of plant material ingested is unknown (97759). Treatment includes cholinesterase inhibitors, such as physostigmine, and sedation with benzodiazepines to reduce anticholinergic delirium (5625, 31293, 97759, 109906).\nless",

Of the evaluated symptoms, improvement was seen in all categories when compared to placebo except for nausea and vomiting, which were present in less than 5% of patients at baseline (94944, 94945).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral anise oil is beneficial inpatients with IBS.\nA small clinical study in adults with IBS shows that taking enteric-coated anise oil 200 mg three times daily for 4 weeks eliminates IBS symptoms in 75% of patients, compared with 53% of patients taking peppermint oil and 35% taking placebo. The greatest symptom improvement occurred with abdominal pain, bloating, and reflux, and was maintained for an additional 2 weeks after treatment completion (94946).\nless\nLactation. It is unclear if oral anise tea is beneficial for increasing human milk production.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in post-partum adults shows that drinking a tea containing anise 2 grams and black tea 1 gram 3 times daily with meals for 7 days increases the volume of pumped human milk on day 7 by an average of 98 mL and 113 mL, respectively, when compared with a placebo of black tea 3 grams daily and when compared with a control group not assigned to any tea or galactagogues (112863).\nless\nLice. Topical anise has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children 6-14 years of age shows that application of a topical spray containing anise oil, coconut oil, and ylang ylang oil three times at 5-day intervals is 92% effective for the treatment of head lice and seems to be comparable in effectiveness to a spray containing permethrin, malathion, piperonyl butoxide, and isododecane (13483).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral anise seed extract is beneficial in patients with menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking anise seed extract 330 mg three times daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of hot flashes by approximately 75% when compared with placebo (94948).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if topical anise essential oil is beneficial in patients with migraine headache.\nA small clinical study in adults with migraine headache shows that applying 2 mL of a cream containing anise essential oil 7% to the temporal and forehead zones at the onset of a migraine reduces the impact of the headache by approximately 10% when compared with a control cream. However, there was no effect of the anise cream on analgesic use or average headache severity when compared with placebo cream. Additionally, due to the strong smell of the anise cream, patient blinding may have been compromised (100166).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral anise extract is beneficial in patients with PMS.\nA small clinical study in female college students with PMS shows that taking anise extract 110 mg three times daily, starting 7 days before menstruation and ending 3 days after, improves concentration, mood, irritability, sleep, food cravings, and other symptoms of PMS, as measured using the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool, when compared with placebo (103875).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate anise for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of anise.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of anise are the seed, oil, and less frequently, the leaf and root. Anise contains chlorogenic acid, naringenin, gallic acid, ellagic acid, taxifolin, coffeic acid, syringic acid, eugenol, trans-anethole, cis-anethole, methylchavicol, anisaldehyde, estragole, anisketone, linalool, coumarins, catechins, scopeletin, umbelliferone, estrols, and beta-farnesene. Anethole is primarily responsible for the licorice-like taste and odor of anise (13485, 13486, 13489, 94950, 94952, 112864).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that anise might have analgesic activity (13487).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, anise oil has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects (94952, 112864). The constituent anethole appears to inhibit the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines (31320).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nAnimal research suggests that anise oil might have anticonvulsant effects (13490).\nAntidepressant effects\nAnimal research suggests that anise seed extract might have antidepressant effects, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear (108547).\nAntidiuretic effects\nThere is interest in using anise to prevent dehydration. In laboratory research, anise seems to increase the activity of sodium-potassium ATPase to increase the absorption of glucose. It also seems to have an antidiuretic effect by stimulating the sodium-potassium pump in the kidney. However, it does not seem to affect colonic sodium-potassium ATPase (13491).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory research shows that anise seed extract and anise oil have antimicrobial effects against various bacteria and fungi (31344, 31390, 31471, 31566, 31571, 31575, 31578). Constituents of interest for this mechanism include p-anisaldehyde and anethole (31375, 31385, 31469, 31479).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal research, anise seed extract mitigates the metronidazole-induced decrease in glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase activity and increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide in the brain (112864). Other animal research also shows anise seed extract to increase GSH, SOD, and catalase levels and decrease MDA levels in the mouse brain (112865).\nAntiviral effects\nIn laboratory research, anise oil has demonstrated antiviral effects against herpes virus strains, as well as human cytomegalovirus and measles virus (31418, 31443, 94952). Trans-anethole and lignin-carbohydrate-protein complexes might be constituents of interest for this activity (31467, 94952).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal research suggests that anise seed extract might have anxiolytic effects, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear (108547).\nEstrogenic effects\nCertain constituents of anise oil, including anethole, might have estrogenic effects (13506). However, in laboratory research, aqueous extracts of anise have demonstrated antiestrogenic effects. The hormonal effects of anise might also result in stimulation of osteoblast activity (12728).\nGalactagogue effects\nIn clinical research, anise augmented human milk production. Animal research suggests it may exert this effect by stimulating release of prolactin (112863).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, anise inhibited gastric mucosal damage and ulceration (31410). Spasmolytic effects have also been identified (94944, 94945).\nInsecticidal effects\nAnise oil is thought to have insecticidal effects. The oil contains trans-anethole and p-anisaldehyde which have demonstrated insecticidal and acaricidal activity (13492, 31379, 31384, 31419, 94952).\nMuscle relaxant effects\nIn laboratory research, anise has demonstrated muscle relaxant effects (94952). Possible mechanisms of action include inhibitory effects on muscarinic receptors, as well as the activation of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway (94952).\nNeurological effects\nLaboratory research suggests that anise oil has gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist effects (13405, 13485). In animal research, anise seed extract mitigates the metronidazole-induced decreases in GABA, dopamine, and serotonin, and the metronidazole-induced increases in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and ischemic neuronal degeneration (112864). Other laboratory and animal research also shows anise seed extract to reduce AChE levels (112865).\nRespiratory effects\nIn laboratory research, the essential oil and aqueous and ethanolic extracts of anise appear to have bronchodilation effects, possibly through anticholinergic activity (13488, 13489).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research shows that topical administration of anise 10% cream daily for 14 days after a skin wound decreases wound size when compared with placebo and tetracycline creams, possibly through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (103874)."

Annatto food coloring has been associated with an increase in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in one case report. A woman with frequent symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain experienced an improvement in all symptoms upon elimination of annatto-containing products; symptoms returned after these products were added back into her diet (95142).\nless\nImmunologic\nWhen used as a food coloring, annatto causes rare cases of allergic reactions in children and adults. Reactions have occurred after consumption of cereal, cheese, ice cream, and other foods containing annatto food coloring, and use of cosmetics containing annatto. Symptoms include urticaria, angioedema, severe hypotension, and anaphylaxis (31619,31621,95157.109549). One patient with a history of urticaria after using cosmetics, or ingesting food containing annatto, was given oral doses of annatto gradually increasing from 1 mg to 100 mg at hourly intervals. Severe urticaria requiring treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids occurred with doses of 50-100 mg, while milder reactions started at around 20 mg (109549). Reactions to annatto food coloring are possibly due to traces of seed protein (95157).\nless",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of annatto is the seed, leaf, and root. The pericarp of the seed is used commercially in dyes and food coloring. Apocarotenoids, including bixin and norbixin, are the primary coloring agents in annatto seed. These constituents are found at levels of 1% to 5% in the seed aril. When used for food color, the level of bixin depends on the type of extraction process used. Annatto seed also contains other carotenoids such as beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, phytoene, lutein, and norbixin in lower levels. The terpene alcohol geranylgeraniol is found at levels of up to 1% in the seed (95143, 109548).\n\nThe chemical constituents of the leaf are not well documented. Bixin and norbixin are found at much lower levels in the leaves than in the seed; alkaloids are found at higher levels. Other constituents include tocopherols, sesquiterpenes, and monoterpenes (95143, 95153).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, the annatto constituent norbixin has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines (101081). Other research suggests that bixin also decreases levels of inflammatory cytokines and decreases oxidative stress in healthy subjects (109548).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that annatto has hypoglycemic effects, related to stimulation of the peripheral utilization of glucose (31616). However, in humans, intake of annatto carotenoids does not alter postprandial glucose or insulin levels (101081).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nIn an animal model of diarrhea, annatto leaf extract reduced the number of wet stools (31608).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAlthough some research has shown that annatto leaf extract has antimicrobial effects against various bacteria and fungi, these effects do not appear to be consistent (31593, 31607, 31608, 95143). Differences in extraction methods, plant growth conditions, and plant-specific levels of chemicals might result in different levels of active constituents.\n\nThere is also interest in using annatto as a photosensitizer for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy for halitosis. Theoretically, when exposed to oxygen and a particular blue light, annatto creates reactive oxygen species and other oxidizing agents that can cause cell death in some microorganisms (105504).\nAntioxidant effects\nAntioxidant effects have been attributed to various annatto leaf and seed constituents, including bixin (95144, 109548). These effects might protect against diabetic and inflammatory complications or promote anti-cancer mechanisms (95144). However, in human research, norbixin decreased levels of postprandial oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and other oxidative markers, while bixin had no or minimal antioxidant effects (101081).\nAntivenom effects\nAnnatto leaves are traditionally used for snake bites. In animal research, annatto leaf and branch extract had strong antivenom activity against snake venom (30971, 31599).\nInsecticidal effects\nThe essential and fixed oils of annatto seed extract are thought to be responsible for the insect repellant effects of annatto (95143)."

As these compounds were found in the blood and urine of healthy individuals, it was hypothesized that these substances may have antitumor properties. In the 1980s, Burzynski identified chemical structures for several of these antineoplastons, and developed a process to prepare them synthetically. Antineoplaston A10, identified as 3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione, was the first to be synthesized. Some antineoplastons are thought to have a broad spectrum of activity with respect to differentiation of neoplastic cells, whereas others are thought to be more selective (20090). There are no high-quality trials supporting the effectiveness of antineoplastons for any indication.",

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nAdverse effects to antineoplastons have been reported in several small clinical studies. It is not clear how common these reactions are, or if they occur more frequently than with placebo. Since many patients taking antineoplastons have been diagnosed with serious illnesses, such as advanced cancers, it is not clear if these effects resulted from the illnesses themselves or were caused by antineoplastons. Adverse effects include sore throat, fever, chills, reduced albumin, increased amylase, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, eosinophilia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and a strong body odor similar to urine (20101, 25604, 25620, 25621). Antineoplastons have also been associated with finger rigidity (25604), as well as metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities (20101, 25603).\nCardiovascular\nIntravenously, antineoplaston A5 has been associated with palpitations at doses up to 153 mg/kg daily (25608). A 71 year-old male bladder cancer patient experienced chest pressure and irregular heartbeat after receiving intravenous antineoplaston A5 58 mg/kg/day for 5 days (25622). Use of intravenous antineoplaston AS2-1, up to 160 mg/kg daily for over 2 years, has been associated with mild hypertension (25604, 25619). Tachycardia occurred in one of 24 patients diagnosed with neoplastic diseases who were given intravenous antineoplaston A3, up to 76 mg/kg daily for up to 1.3 years (25607).\nless\nDermatologic\nIntravenously, mild maculopapular allergic-type rash has been noted in patients receiving antineoplaston AS2-1, up to 160 mg/kg daily for up to 2.4 years (25619). During 6 months of intravenous bolus injections of A10 (11.3 grams/kg daily) and AS2-1 (0.4 grams/kg daily), three cases of skin rash were reported for patients with recurrent brain stem glioma (25603). Mild pruritus has been observed in two patients undergoing therapy with A10, AS2-1, and A10-1 (25623). Redness of hands and feet has been noted for patients injected with AS2-5 (25624).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, abdominal pain, and excessive flatulence has been reported for patients with neoplastic disease treated with antineoplaston A10 100-149 mg/kg/day for up to 149 days (20101, 25620).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally and intravenously, decreased bone marrow activity has been reported for patients treated with chemotherapy along with antineoplaston A10 or antineoplaston AS2-1; however, this effect has not been observed for patients treated with these antineoplastons without chemotherapy (20101, 25604).\n\nIntravenously, antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 have been associated with anemia and lowered white blood cell counts in patients with brain tumors (25603, 25611, 99814). Decreases in white blood cell and platelets have also been reported for patients treated with A10, AS2-1 and A10-1 (25623). However, increases in white blood cells and platelets have also been reported for patients treated with antineoplaston A or antineoplaston AS2-1 (20099, 25620).\n\nIntravenously, hypernatremia has been reported for patients with brain stem glioma treated with antineoplastons AS10 and AS2-1 (25603, 99813). In one study, 3 of 17 patients experienced hypernatremia; one patient developed grade 4 hypernatremia (99813).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally and intravenously, antineoplaston A10 10-40 grams daily and antineoplaston AS2-1 12-30 grams daily have been associated with liver dysfunction (25604).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally and intravenously, antineoplastons AS2-1 and A10 have been associated with peripheral edema (25604). Swelling of joints (25624), muscle and joint pain (25603, 25620, 25621), muscle contractions in the throat (25620), weakness (25603), and fatigue (25603) have been reported for patients treated with antineoplastons A2, AS2-1, AS2-5, and/or A10.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally and intravenously, headache, fatigue, sleepiness, ringing in the ears, and numbness have been reported for patients treated with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 (25593, 25601, 25603, 25610, 25620). Dizziness has also been noted for some patients treated with oral antineoplaston A10 (20101) or intravenous antineoplaston A3 (25607).\nless\nOther\nIntravenously, fever has been reported in patients receiving 6 months of treatment with A10 (11.3 grams/kg daily) and AS2-1 (0.4 grams/kg daily) (25603, 25619).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBrain tumor. Some limited evidence suggests that antineoplastons might help achieve complete or partial response in some patients with various types of brain tumors. However, all of this research suffers from small size, poor study design, and the lack of a comparator group. At this time, there isn't enough reliable evidence to support using antineoplastons for any type of cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using antineoplastons in patients with various types of brain tumors, in conjunction with remission maintenance therapy for up to 3 years, results in tumor disappearance in 11% of patients, 50% reduction in tumor size in 22% of patients, no change in tumor size in 22% of patients, and ≥50% tumor growth in 45% of patients (25600). Some, but not all, of the patients underwent radiotherapy and surgical removal of the tumor prior to antineoplastons treatment. The type of antineoplastons used in this study was not reported, and it is not apparent if the antineoplastons were administered orally or intravenously.\n\nAntineoplastons have also been studied in brain stem glioma. A collection of small clinical studies in adult patients with recurrent brain stem glioma shows that intravenous administration of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 for an average of 6 months results in complete response in 11% of patients, partial response in 11% of patients, stable disease in 39% of patients, and progressive disease in 35% of patients (25603, 99814). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that administering multiple intravenous injections of A10 and AS2-1 in escalating doses does not promote tumor regression in patients with recurrent glioma following radiation therapy (25593).\n\nIn children with a type of recurrent and progressive glioma called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), one small clinical study shows that intravenous administration of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 for an average of 5 months results in complete response in 6% of patients, partial response in 34% of patients, stable disease in 12% of patients, and progressive disease in 41% of patients (99813). Another small clinical study shows that a longer treatment duration involving intravenous antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 for an average of 16 months, followed by oral treatment for an average of 19 months, results in complete response in 33% of patients, partial response in 25% of patients, stable disease in 33% of patients, and progressive disease in 0% of patients (25610).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Preliminary clinical research in adults who have undergone hepatectomy due to metastatic colorectal cancer shows that intravenous administration of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1, in conjunction with hepatic arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil, increases average cancer-specific survival from 39 months to 67 months, but does not reduce relapse-free survival, when compared with receiving 5-fluorouracil alone (99812). Tell patients there isn't enough reliable evidence to support using antineoplastons for any type of cancer.\nPrimitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). In pediatric patients at high-risk for PNETs, preliminary clinical research shows that administering a combination of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 as intravenous infusions for 1.2 to 67 months results in complete response in 23% of patients, partial response in 8% of patients, stable disease in 31% of patients, and disease progression in 38% of patients (25611). This research suffers from poor study design and the lack of a comparator group. Tell patients there isn't enough reliable evidence to support using antineoplastons for any type of cancer.\nProstate cancer. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering AS2-1 along with diethylstilbestrol 0.01-0.02 mg/kg daily to patients with prostate cancer results in complete remission in 14% of patients, partial remission in 22% of patients, disease stabilization in 50% of patients, and disease progression in 14% of patients (20102). This research suffers from poor study design and the lack of a comparator group. Tell patients there isn't enough reliable evidence to support using antineoplastons for any type of cancer.\nMore evidence is needed to rate antineoplastons for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nProstate cancer: Antineoplaston AS2-1 97-130 mg/kg daily has been used orally for 64-425 days in combination with diethylstilbestrol 0.01-0.02 mg/kg daily (20102).\n\nColorectal cancer: Antineoplaston AS2-1 10 grams daily for 1 year has been used after initial intravenous therapy with antineoplaston A10 in patients who have undergone hepatectomy due to colorectal cancer (99812).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Brain tumor: Intravenous injections of antineoplaston A10 7.7 grams/kg daily and antineoplastons AS2-1 0.36 gram/kg daily have been used in patients with primary brain tumors (25601). Intravenous injections of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 have been administered every 4 hours for approximately 2-6 months in patients with recurrent gliomas. The average daily maximum dose for A10 was 1-13.37 grams/kg and for AS2-1 was 0.4-0.49 grams/kg (25593, 25603, 99814).\n\nColorectal cancer: Intravenous injections of antineoplaston A10 30 grams daily for one week, followed by oral therapy with antineoplaston AS2-1, has been used in patients who have undergone hepatectomy due to colorectal cancer (99812).\nChildren\nOral:\nBrain tumor: Antineoplastons A10 0.28 gram/kg daily and AS2-1 0.28 grams/kg daily have been used orally for an average of 19 months in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (25610).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Brain tumor: Antineoplastons A10 7.95 grams/kg daily and AS2-1 0.33 grams/kg daily have been used intravenously for an average of 16 months in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (25610). Antineoplastons A10 5.7-15.9 grams/kg daily and AS2-1 0.2-0.58 grams/kg daily have been used intravenously for an average of 5 months in children with DIPG (99813).\n\nPrimitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET): Intravenous infusions containing a combination of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 have been administered for 1.2 to 67 months. The average dose of A10 was 10.3 grams/kg daily, and the average dose of AS2-1 was 0.38 grams/kg daily (25611).\nStandardization & Formulation\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the standardization of antineoplastons.",

            "Overdose": "General: Potentially toxic compounds in antineoplastons are amino acids and peptides (25612). Chronic toxicity has been noted with all types of antineoplastons when given for weeks to years. However, in most cases it is difficult to distinguish adverse effects due to antineoplastons from those arising from the primary tumor or co-therapies. Researchers who have studied the toxicology of antineoplastons report far less toxicity than with other chemotherapeutic agents (25604).\n\nA2: In tissue culture and acute animal toxicity studies, the LD50 for antineoplaston A2 was determined to be 3.55 grams/kg (25612). However, other animal research suggests that intraperitoneal injections of antineoplaston A2 are safe when used at doses up to 1.3 grams/kg daily for up to 270 days (25613).\n\nA5: Animal research suggests that the LD50 for antineoplaston A5 is 5.11 gram/kg. Daily injections of antineoplaston A5 up to approximately 1.3 grams/kg daily for up to one year appear to be safe, with no adverse effects noted in animal research (25608).\n\nA10: Animal research suggests that the LD50 for antineoplaston A10 is more than 10 grams/kg. Daily injections of antineoplaston A10 1 gram/kg daily for up to one year appear to be safe, with no adverse effects noted in animal research (20101, 25614).\n\nAS2-1: Animal research suggests that the LD50 for antineoplaston AS2-1 is approximately 3 grams/kg (25606). The LD50 for phenylacetate, a constituent of antineoplaston AS2-1 is 2.7 grams/kg (25606).\n\nAS2-5: Animal research suggests that the LD50 for antineoplaston AS2-5 is 2.90 grams/kg (25606).\n\nNS-21: Animal research suggests that NS-21 500-750 mg/kg/day orally for 13-26 weeks can cause mortality (25616, 25617). Lower doses, ranging from 5-150 mg/kg, do not appear to cause mortality (25616, 25617). Animal research suggests that low-dose NS-21 5-6 mg/kg daily for up to 26 weeks does not cause any observable adverse effects (25616, 25617, 25618).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOral and injectable forms of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 are absorbed rapidly (25601). A10 reaches the highest concentration in blood approximately 3 hours after oral administration. The absorption and highest blood concentration of oral antineoplaston A10 appears to be increased when mixed with 0.1% Tween-80 (25650). The maximum concentration of AS2-1 can be detected in urine approximately 3 hours after oral administration (25601). In humans, a single bolus dose of phenylacetate, a constituent of antineoplaston AS2-1, followed by 14 days of continuous infusion shows nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with a Km = 105.1 ± 44.5 mcg/mL and Vmax = 24.1 ± 5.2 mg/kg/hour (25654).\nDistribution\nAnimal research suggests that, when administered orally, antineoplaston A10 distributes mainly to the bladder, kidney, stomach, and liver. Lower amounts of antineoplaston A10 accumulate in the spleen, heart, brain, and lungs (26167). The median volume of distribution of intravenously administered phenylacetate, a constituent of antineoplaston AS2-1, is reported to be 0.33 L/kg in humans (25609). Phenylacetate has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (25654).\nMetabolism\nWhen administered orally, antineoplaston A10 is hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes to phenylacetylglutamine and phenylacetylisoglutamine (25644, 25651, 25652). Intravenously administered phenylacetate, a constituent of antineoplaston AS2-1, is conjugated with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine (25654).\nExcretion\nEvidence from animal research suggests that 40% to 42% of orally administered radiolabeled antineoplaston A10 is excreted in the urine in 6 hours (25655). Approximately 99% of phenylacetate that is eliminated following intravenous administration is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine (25654). The maximum rate of phenylacetate elimination appears to be 21.8 mg/kg/hour in humans (25609).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAntineoplastons are compounds that consist of peptides, amino acid derivatives, and organic acids. Antineoplastons were initially isolated from the blood of healthy individuals. However, they are now produced synthetically.\n\nThere are two primary groups of antineoplastons (20090). One group is thought to have a broad spectrum of activity in many different cell lines and includes antineoplastons A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A10, and A10-1. The other group, which consists of antineoplastons H, L, O, F, Ch and K, has narrow spectrums of activity against single cell lines. Antineoplastons A10, A10-1, AS2-1 and AS2-5 are synthetic derivatives of glutamine, isoglutamine, and phenylacetate (antineoplaston AS5) (20090). Antineoplaston AS2-5 consists of phenylacetylglutamine (25624). The injectable formulation of antineoplaston A10 is composed of phenylacetylglutamine and phenylacetylisoglutamine. Antineoplaston AS2-1 is composed of a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine.\nAnti-cancer effects\nAnimal research suggests that antineoplaston AS2-1 can reduce lung metastasis from colon cancer and increase in survival following cecal removal (25643). Other animal research suggests that antineoplaston A10 can reduce the number of tumors in animals with lung cancer and can delay the onset and growth of breast tumors (25636, 25647, 25648).\n\nVarious potential mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the possible anti-cancer effects of antineoplastons. These proposed mechanisms include inducing differentiation of neoplastic cells by forming a system parallel to the immune system and reprogramming it (25626); inhibiting oncogene expression, which limits the proliferation of malignant cells and induces terminal differentiation (25625, 25627, 25628); inhibiting invasiveness by modifying cell structure and increasing expression of adhesion molecules (25629); preventing trans-cellular membrane transport of glutamine and leucine, which prevents mitosis in cancer cells (20090, 20093, 25631, 25632, 25633); inhibiting nucleic acid methylation in cancer cells, leading to terminal differentiation (20093, 25632); intercalating between pairs in DNA and interaction with adenosine units (25632, 25645); or inducing G1 arrest and apoptosis (25635, 25643, 25644).\n\nPhenylacetate, a component of antineoplaston AS2-1, has been found to increase P27Kip1 expression, which initiates other cell cycle events that lead to G1 cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells (25635). Phenylacetate also appears to induce selective growth arrest human leukemia cells, possibly by depleting glutamine or down-regulating oncogene expression (25625). In vitro evidence suggests that phenylacetate inhibits proliferation and reduces malignancy of a canine breast cancer cell line, possibly by inducing cell differentiation (25637). In ovarian cancer cell lines, sodium phenylacetate reduces the percentage of cells that are cyclin- D1- and p21/ras-positive, reduces the percentage of cells that are bcl-2-positive, increases the percentage of cells that are bax/p21-positive, and decreases the percentage of transforming growth factor beta2-positive cells (25638).\n\nSome research suggests that beneficial effects of antineoplaston A10 occur in only patients with an endogenous level of antineoplaston peptides greater than 30 nmol/mL prior to treatment (25646). Also, clinical evidence suggests that positive response to antineoplaston therapy is associated with normalization of urinary and blood peptide levels during treatment (25630). Along with normalizing peptide levels, antineoplaston A10 may help treat cancer by stimulating the immune system. Some evidence suggests that patients with breast cancer have higher neutrophil apoptosis levels compared to healthy patients; antineoplaston A10 appears to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis in vitro (25634).\n\nIn vitro evidence suggests that antineoplastons A3 and A5 inhibit the growth of carcinoma and leukemia cell lines (25640, 25641). However, there may be differences among the antineoplastons studied. In breast cancer cells in vitro, antineoplaston AS2-5 had less or no antineoplastic activity when compared to antineoplaston AS2-1 (25606). Also, some piperidinedione antineoplaston A10 analogs, 3B and 3D, had more potent antiproliferative effects in a human breast cancer cell line when compared with A10 itself or tamoxifen (25642).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nWhen antineoplaston A5 was given intraperitoneally to rats and mice, there was an increase in the concentration of dopamine and noradrenalin in the brain and a decrease in the use of these neurotransmitters (25649). Evidence from animal research suggests that antineoplaston A5 neutralizes both hyper- and hypo-activity of central dopaminergic structures (25658). Phenylacetyl-CoA, a metabolite of phenylacetate, is a potent inhibitor of choline acetyltransferase in the brain (25653)."

Oral antioxidant supplements do not appear to prevent bladder cancer.\nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials shows that taking antioxidant supplements such as vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and pyridoxine does not prevent bladder cancer (102950).\nless\nCancer. Oral antioxidant supplements do not appear to prevent cancer.\nMeta-analyses of up to 43 clinical trials show that taking antioxidant supplements does not prevent cancer or reduce cancer recurrence or mortality when compared with placebo (34563, 102947, 105704).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most high-quality research shows that taking antioxidant supplements does not prevent CVD or reduce the risk of CVD-related complications.\nAlthough observational research has found that consuming antioxidant-containing fruits and vegetables reduces mortality in heart disease (3934, 99022), evidence from large meta-analyses and clinical trials show that antioxidant supplements are not effective for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death (3934, 83050, 102954). In contrast, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials lasting at least 26 weeks shows that taking antioxidant supplements containing selenium reduces CVD-related mortality when compared with taking placebo or antioxidant supplements without selenium. However, a subgroup analysis suggests these effects are apparent only in healthy adults, and not those with preexisting health conditions such as CVD or hypercholesterolemia. Other CVD outcomes, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, were not improved, regardless of the presence of selenium (105704).\n\nFurthermore, one meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with CVD shows that taking high-dose antioxidants such as vitamin C increases the risk of mortality when compared with placebo (15305). This study has been criticized because it pooled together very different types of interventions.\nless\nCataracts. Oral antioxidant supplements do not appear to prevent cataracts or the need for cataract surgery.\nA meta-analysis of nine clinical trials shows that taking antioxidant supplements such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc for up to 8 years does not reduce the incidence of cataracts or the need for cataract surgery (34626).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Long-term use of the antioxidants selenium or vitamin E does not appear to prevent colorectal cancer.\nA large clinical trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), shows that taking the antioxidants selenium or vitamin E daily for at least 7 years does not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer when compared with placebo (16707).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. Oral antioxidant supplements do not appear to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer or its recurrence.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies shows that taking antioxidants such as beta-carotene, vitamin E, or vitamin C does not prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer or skin cancer recurrence when compared with control (102494).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral antioxidant supplements do not appear to prevent prostate cancer.\nA meta-analysis of nine clinical studies shows that taking antioxidants such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, or selenium does not reduce prostate cancer risk (34598). Individual studies also show no benefit (16707, 16708, 17688).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although oral antioxidants do not seem to prevent onset of AMD, they may prevent the progression of advanced AMD.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials shows that taking the antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene does not prevent or delay the onset of AMD when compared with placebo (102498). However, taking a specific antioxidant multivitamin supplement containing vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene daily, with or without zinc, reduces the risk of visual acuity loss by up to 27% and reduces the risk of progression to advanced AMD at 5 years by up to 32% in patients at high risk for developing advanced AMD (7303, 7304, 11326, 90069, 95839).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral antioxidant supplements decrease the risk of Alzheimer disease.\nA meta-analysis of four observational studies has found that the highest intakes of the antioxidants vitamins C and E, from supplements alone, are associated with an approximately 18% lower relative risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with the lowest intakes. Conversely, beta-carotene and flavonoids were not associated with Alzheimer disease risk (114426).\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Small clinical studies suggests that oral antioxidants do not improve survival in patients with ALS.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with ALS shows that taking the antioxidants vitamin E, L-methionine, and selenium does not improve survival when compared with placebo (102949).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral antioxidant supplements can improve anxiety scores.\nA meta-analysis of 21 mostly small- to moderate-sized clinical studies in a variety of different patient populations shows that taking a wide range of antioxidant supplements for an average of 11 weeks modestly reduces anxiety scores when compared with placebo or control (114425). However, the validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity in the specific antioxidant used, the treatment regimen, and baseline anxiety severity.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial in patients with asthma.\nObservational research has found that reduced intake of the antioxidant vitamin A and vitamin C is associated with increased odds of asthma and wheeze. However, vitamin E intake does not seem to impact asthma risk (34587).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral or topical antioxidants are beneficial in children or adults with atopic dermatitis.\nA meta-analysis of 18 small clinical studies in patients with atopic dermatitis suggests that specific antioxidants, some administered orally and others topically, in combination with prescription treatments, may modestly reduce overall disease severity when compared with placebo or control. A subgroup analysis suggests that oral vitamins D and E, taken alone or in combination, as well as oral vitamins A, D, and E combined with topical vitamin B12, may be most likely to offer benefit; however, benefits were only identified in children, not adults (114416). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity related to treatment regimen and patient population.\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants do not seem to improve most symptoms or behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nA meta-analysis of 13 small clinical trials in patients with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking antioxidants for up to 24 weeks does not improve most symptoms or behaviors when compared with placebo. Of the 22 symptoms or behaviors measured, antioxidant therapy only improved irritability and communication disturbance when compared with placebo (108545).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial for the prevention of cervical cancer.\nObservational research has found that increased intake or blood levels of antioxidant vitamins such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E are associated with reduced odds of cervical neoplasm when compared with reduced intake or blood levels (34609).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral antioxidants decrease the risk of cognitive impairment.\nA meta-analysis of 5 observational studies has found that the intake of supplements providing the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, or flavonoids are not associated with risk of cognitive impairment (114426).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Several small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants do not improve survival rates or length of hospitalization in patients with critical illness.\nA network meta-analysis of 37 small clinical trials in patients with critical illness shows that taking antioxidants does not reduce mortality risk, infection risk, length of hospital stay, duration of ventilation, or length of intensive care unit stay when compared with placebo (108546).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants do not seem to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nA meta-analysis of 20 small clinical studies in patients with cystic fibrosis shows that taking antioxidants such as vitamin E, beta-carotene, and N-acetylcysteine does not improve lung function. However, a few small clinical studies show that oral or inhaled glutathione might improve lung function and breathing when compared with control (102948).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral antioxidants decrease the risk of dementia.\nA meta-analysis of 4-5 observational studies has found that the highest intakes of the antioxidants vitamins C and E, from supplements alone, are associated with an approximately 20% lower relative risk of all-cause dementia when compared with the lowest intakes. Conversely, beta-carotene and flavonoids were not associated with risk of all-cause dementia (114426).\nless\nDepression. Small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants might modestly improve symptoms of depression.\nA meta-analysis of 52 mostly small- to moderate-sized clinical studies in a variety of different patient populations shows that taking antioxidant supplements for 1-24 months modestly reduces depression scores when compared with placebo or control (114425). However, the validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity in the specific antioxidant used, treatment regimens, and baseline depression severity.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants do not seem to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy but might improve some markers of kidney function.\nMeta-analyses of up to 14 small clinical trials show that taking antioxidants such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, green tea, turmeric, methionine, or ubiquinone does not affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, but might reduce albuminuria, increase blood urea nitrogen, and reduce estimated glomerular filtration rate, when compared with control (97069, 102942). As most of the studies analyzed lasted less than 12 months, the long-term effects of antioxidant supplementation on renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy are unclear.\nless\nEndometriosis. Several small clinical studies suggest that taking oral vitamin E supplements, with or without vitamin C supplements, may modestly improve endometriosis symptoms.\nA meta-analysis of up to 6 mostly small clinical studies in adults with endometriosis shows that taking the antioxidant vitamin E, either in combination with birth control or the antioxidant vitamin C, for 2-6 months reduces endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia when compared with placebo (114410). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment regimens.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Some clinical studies suggest that a specific oral antioxidant, L-arginine, may modestly improve erectile function when combined with prescription ED medications. The benefits of other antioxidants are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small- to moderate-sized clinical studies in adults with ED shows that taking L-arginine along with other antioxidant supplements, with or without prescription ED medications (PDE-5 inhibitors), for 4-24 weeks improves erectile function and sexual satisfaction scores when compared with either placebo or prescription medications alone (114411). However, the validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial for HIV/AIDS.\nA large clinical study in adults with asymptomatic, treatment-naïve HIV and CD4 T-lymphocyte counts between 375-750 cells/uL shows that taking a specific high-dose antioxidant-micronutrient supplement (K-PAX Ultra®, K-PAX Health) 8 capsules twice daily for up to 96 weeks does not prolong the time to disease progression when compared with a basic multivitamin containing nutrients not exceeding the recommended daily allowance. Disease progression was defined as initiation of antiretroviral treatment, an increase in HIV viral load, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count below 350 cells/uL, or an AIDS diagnosis. The product used in this study provided vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, acetyl-L-carnitine, lipoic acid, N-acetyl cysteine, carotenoids, and vitamin B6 (114419).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial for improving fertility in adults with ovarian insufficiency.\nA meta-analysis of up to 20 clinical studies in adults with diminished ovarian reserve or ovarian insufficiency shows that oral antioxidants increase the clinical pregnancy rate by about 1.55-fold, but do not increase live birth rates, when compared with control. Although various antioxidants were used in these studies, a subgroup analysis found that only coenzyme Q10, at a dose of at least 30 mg daily for 3 months prior to ovarian stimulation, improves pregnancy rates (116092).\nless\nMale infertility. Small clinical studies in males with subfertility or infertility from various causes suggest that oral antioxidants may improve certain sperm parameters; however, any impact on pregnancy or birth rates is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of six small clinical studies in males with infertility who have received varicocelectomy shows that taking antioxidant supplements improves sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology at 3 months when compared with control. However, there was no benefit noted at 6 months and no improvement in pregnancy rates overall (102953). Similarly, meta-analyses of clinical and prospective observational studies in males with various forms of infertility, including subfertility, varicocele, and oligo-, astheno-, and/or teratozoospermia, shows that taking antioxidant supplements modestly increases sperm concentration and motility when compared with control. However, these studies did not evaluate pregnancy or birth rates (11189, 114418, 114422).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants do not seem to improve liver health in patients with NAFLD.\nA meta-analysis of six small clinical studies in patients with NAFLD shows that taking antioxidants does not significantly improve markers of liver injury when compared with placebo. It is unclear if antioxidants have any effect on liver fibrosis (102943).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral antioxidants can increase weight loss or improve metabolic parameters in adults with obesity.\nA meta-analysis of up to 18 mostly small clinical studies in adults with obesity shows that taking oral antioxidants for 1-6 months modestly reduces body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and serum lipid levels, but does not improve waist-to-hip ratio or fat mass, when compared with placebo (114424). The validity of these findings is limited by high heterogeneity, likely related to the varying patient populations and treatment regimens. Treatments classified as antioxidants in this analysis included licorice, blueberry, green tea, almonds, melatonin, garlic, zinc, resveratrol, L-arginine, and others.\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial for reducing oral mucositis in adults undergoing radiation therapy.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, shows that taking supplements providing the antioxidants vitamin E or zinc decreases the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with placebo. Meta-analyses of other antioxidant supplements could not be completed due to insufficient available research (114415).\nless\nOverall mortality. Several clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidant supplements containing selenium might reduce the risk of mortality in healthy adults. However, antioxidant supplements with or without selenium do not seem to reduce mortality risk in patients with underlying health issues.\nObservational research has found that following a diet with high amounts of antioxidants such as beta-carotene, selenium, lycopene, and vitamin C is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (102940). However, these effects may be dependent on the ingredients present in the antioxidant supplements. A meta-analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials lasting at least 26 weeks shows that taking antioxidant supplements containing selenium reduces mortality when compared with taking placebo or antioxidant supplements without selenium. A subgroup analysis suggests these effects are apparent only in healthy adults, and not those with preexisting health conditions such as cardiovascular disease or hypercholesterolemia. This meta-analysis also identified a dose-response relationship between selenium and overall mortality reduction, but no additional benefits were seen at doses of selenium greater than 50 mcg daily (105704).\n\nHowever, an older meta-analysis of 68 clinical studies in patients with cardiovascular disease shows that taking high-dose antioxidants such as vitamin C increases the risk of mortality by 5% when compared with placebo (15305). This study has been criticized because it pooled together very different types of interventions.\nless\nPancreatitis. Although oral antioxidants might reduce hospital stay in acute pancreatitis and reduce pain in chronic pancreatitis, they do not seem to prevent complications of pancreatitis.\nA meta-analysis of six small clinical studies in patients with acute pancreatitis shows that taking antioxidant vitamins and minerals reduces hospital stay by 2.6 days when compared with placebo (102938). Furthermore, meta-analyses of small clinical studies in patients with chronic pancreatitis show that taking antioxidants reduces pain when compared with placebo (102938, 102951, 102955). These analyses are limited due to poor quality and short duration of the included studies. Furthermore, not all research has been positive. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking antioxidants does not prevent complications of pancreatitis such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (102938, 102939).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Small clinical studies suggest that certain oral antioxidants may modestly improve lipid and hormone levels in adults with PCOS.\nMeta-analyses of up to 34 small clinical studies in adults with PCOS show that taking a range of antioxidant supplements for 2-3 months improve hormone, lipid, and glucose levels and modestly reduces blood pressure and body weight when compared with placebo. The supplements classified as antioxidants in these meta-analyses included melatonin, magnesium, folate, zinc, selenium, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, curcumin, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, chromium, soy isoflavones, probiotics, synbiotics, pomegranate juice, and garlic (114414, 114420, 114421).\n\nAlmost all studies included in these meta-analyses were small and conducted in Iran, which may limit the generalizability of results. Additionally, findings are limited by significant heterogeneity of treatment regiments, treatment durations, and patient characteristics.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Several small clinical studies suggest that some oral antioxidants might reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation and shorten the duration of intubation, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay after cardiac surgery.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical studies in patients recovering from cardiac surgery shows that taking antioxidants reduces postoperative atrial fibrillation (102500). Another meta-analysis of 29 small clinical studies assessing the effects of specific antioxidants shows that taking polyunsaturated fatty acids and N-acetylcysteine reduces the odds of atrial fibrillation when compared to control, while the antioxidant vitamin C does not seem to have that benefit (102489). Meta-analyses of clinical research also show that antioxidants shorten the duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, and intubation time after cardiac surgery when compared with control (91233, 102500).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral antioxidants are beneficial for the prevention of pre-eclampsia; research findings are mixed.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research including over 10,000 pregnant adults shows that taking antioxidant supplements providing vitamin C , vitamin E, selenium, L-arginine, allicin, lycopene, or coenzyme Q10 does not prevent pre-eclampsia when compared with control (102952). However, a similar meta-analysis including many, but not all, of the same studies shows that taking antioxidant supplements reduces the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by about 14% when compared with control. However, the confidence interval for this finding ranged from 0.75 to 0.99 (114412). The reasons for these discrepant findings may be due to the significant heterogeneity in treatment regimens, as well as differing methods for study selection.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral antioxidants might improve psychotic symptoms, but not overall symptoms, in patients with schizophrenia.\nA meta-analysis of 22 small clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking antioxidants in addition to conventional treatment does not improve overall symptoms, but may improve psychotic scores, when compared with conventional treatment alone (102944).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate antioxidants for these uses.",

Oxidation or \"oxidative stress\" is caused by free radicals and is thought to contribute to progression of various diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Oxidative stress occurs naturally in the body during exercise, when food is converted to energy, and from external factors such as exposure to smoke, radiation, or environmental contaminants. Antioxidants are able to donate an electron to free radicals to stabilize them (102497, 102948).\n\nClinical research evaluating antioxidant supplementation in adults with various health conditions has reported improvements in blood markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxides, and reactive oxygen species (114410, 114413, 114414, 114424, 116093). Other clinical research shows that various antioxidant supplements can increase total antioxidant capacity (114414) and superoxide dismutase (114424) and decrease tumor necrosis factor-alpha (114424)."

When apoaequorin conjugates with coelenterazine, a luciferin obtained from the jellyfish’s diet, the photoprotein aequorin is formed. When aequorin comes into contact with calcium ions, a blue light emits from the jellyfish. This same chemical reaction has been used by researchers for decades to study calcium’s role in a variety of intracellular processes (90309).\nCognitive effects\nCalcium dysregulation is thought to play a significant role in age-associated declines in brain function, with elevated calcium levels in neuronal cells ultimately leading to cell death. Endogenous calcium-binding proteins have been shown to protect neuronal cells from calcium-mediated toxicity. Due to apoaequorin's similar structure to human calcium-binding proteins, some researchers theorize that it may help regulate calcium homeostasis and reduce the progression of age-related declines in memory and cognitive functioning (90305, 90309). In animal research, infusing apoaequorin directly into the dorsal hippocampus of aged rats abolishes memory deficits associated with a fear conditioning process (105532)."

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with apple.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, epicatechins were absorbed from an apple extract and apple puree with levels in the blood within 30 minutes of consumption. However, absorption was faster and larger from the extract (94415). Total phenolic levels in human blood increases maximally in most people within 4-6 hours of consumption of unfiltered apple juice (94426). Flavonols and flavan-3-ols have been identified in plasma following consumption of unfiltered apple juice (94426). Any measured increase in flavanols in plasma might be dependent on methods of analysis. Changes in plasma levels of these constituents have not been shown in all research (94423).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, epicatechin glucuronides from apple are hydrolysed to free epicatechins (94415). Most polyphenols are modified by methylation, sulfation, and/or glucuronidation in the plasma (94426).\nExcretion\nIn human research, consumption of apple extract and puree with known amounts of epicatechins, resulted in epicatechin excretion in the urine. Levels were almost back to baseline within 24 hours (94415). Flavan-3-ols and benzoic acid, and to a lesser extent hydroxycinnamic acid and flavonols, have been identified in urine following consumption of unfiltered apple juice. However, the time to and level of excretion is variable among individuals with maximal excretion ranging from 1-8 hours after consumption and some subjects showing no increase (94423, 94426).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of apple is the fruit. Apple contains polyphenols, ursolic acid, and pectin that may be responsible for some of its effects. The peel is a higher source of polyphenols than the flesh. The level and type of polyphenols is dependent on various things including the cultivar/color and the level of processing (31667, 31671, 31681, 31686, 31689, 94423, 94426).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, dried apple consumption reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting the potential for systemic anti-inflammatory effects. Elevated CRP levels are associated with various chronic diseases including atherosclerosis (94414). A small clinical study in otherwise healthy adults with overweight or obesity shows that eating 3 small whole apples does not mitigate postprandial inflammation induced by a high-fat meal when compared with not eating apples (108792). A similarly designed study evaluating fasting plasma biomarkers of inflammation shows that regular consumption of apples for 6 months reduces CRP and interleukin (IL)-6 when compared with baseline; values at 6 months were reduced when compared with no apple consumption. However, it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups (108793).\nAntiallergic effects\nThe polyphenols and oligomeric procyanidins found in apple have an effect on regulating allergic reaction (31690). This is possibly due to antioxidant effects of these apple constituents, preventing the breakdown or use of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes (31681).\nAntibacterial effects\nApples contain the phenolic compound phloretin, which has antibacterial activity (6). Proanthocyanidins, like the ones found in apple juice, inhibit bacterial adhesion in the urinary tract in clinical research (31686).\nAnticancer effects\nThe apple phenolic constituent quercetin is an antioxidant flavonoid found in high concentrations in apples. Quercetin is thought to be responsible for apple's potential benefit in preventing lung cancer (3469, 3470).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using apple to reduce glycemic response and to improve outcomes in diabetes. A small clinical study in healthy patients shows that eating dried apple results in lower blood glucose and insulin concentrations when compared to eating a muffin that contains an equal amount of carbohydrates (99448). However, a small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that substituting white wheat flour in bread with powdered, dehydrated apple for up to 4 weeks does not improve glycemic control (13141).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using apple polyphenols for cardiovascular benefits. In a small clinical trial in healthy patients, eating an apple with the polyphenol-rich skin of two apples daily seems to improve endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), both immediately and after 4 weeks, when compared with eating an apple without the skin. However, there were no differences between groups in blood pressure and arterial stiffness (99446).\nDrug metabolizing effects\nApple juice is thought to inhibit the drug transporter protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP), which reduces bioavailability of OATP substrates. Fexofenadine (Allegra) is a substrate of OATP. Clinical research shows that coadministration of apple juice decreases bioavailability of fexofenadine by about 78% (7046). In an animal model, apple juice decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by 22% (17605). It is thought that apple juice might affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of apple juice by at least 4 hours might avoid this interaction (17603, 17604).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe pectin in apple probably accounts for its effect on diarrhea and constipation. Pectin absorbs water in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and swells to a gummy mass. The mass provides bulk which tends to alter gastrointestinal transit time and normalize bowel function (12575, 31703). A small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that gastrointestinal transit time is slowed and water volume in the colon is increased with whole apple consumption when compared with the consumption of apple juice or apple puree (104184).\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nThe effect of apple on cholesterol levels in human research depends on the form consumed. For example, apple juice or powder consumption might increase levels of cholesterol and triglyceride (2215, 13141). However, cloudy apple juice high in vitamin C and polyphenols has a small benefit on cholesterol levels, suggesting that the level of refining might impact any beneficial effects (94423). Furthermore, consumption of dried apples has been shown to lower cholesterol levels in postmenopausal adults (94414). This is likely due to the fiber from apples which has been shown to lower cholesterol levels (31714). Pectin is thought to decrease levels of cholesterol in the blood by increasing gut viscosity thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol re-absorbed in to the body in bile forcing the body to make more bile from cholesterol. The degree of esterification and molecular weight of the pectin appear to play a role in cholesterol reduction (92473).\nMuscle effects\nApple skin contains ursolic acid, a triterpenoid that contributes to the waxy coat on apple skins. Research in animal models suggests that ursolic acid might have an effect on muscle mass. In animals fed ursolic acid, muscle mass, exercise capacity, and grip strength increased (17998). Human research is not as clear although a combination of ancient peat and apple extract has been shown to increase ATP in plasma and muscle (94418, 94419).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is some interest in using apples for improving lung function. There is some evidence that consuming 5 or more apples per week can improve lung function as measured by maximum forced expiration in one second (FEV1) (3469).\nWeight loss effects\nApple skin contains ursolic acid, a triterpenoid that contributes to the waxy coat on apple skins. Research in animal models suggests that ursolic acid increases amounts of brown fat. Animals fed ursolic acid had increased calorie expenditure, decreased weight, and improved glucose tolerance (17998). Whether eating apples contributes to satiety is unclear. One small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that eating dried apple does not seem to impact satiety when compared with eating a muffin that contains an equal amount of carbohydrates (99448). However, another small clinical study in healthy individuals shows that eating whole apples increases satiety and feelings of fullness when compared with apple juice. In this study, whole apple consumption also slowed gastric emptying and increased water volume in the colon when compared with apple juice and apple puree (104184)."

While it is most popularly used in salad dressings and cooking, apple cider vinegar has been traditionally used for a variety of medical reasons, including wound disinfection (93073).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using apple cider vinegar for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",

There is one published report of an individual who developed a chemical burn caused by a single topical application of apple cider vinegar containing 5% acetic acid to the skin (91662). Another case of chemical burn has been reported for a 14-year-old patient who applied apple cider vinegar to the skin for 3 days to remove a nevi. Symptoms included erythema, irritation, and non-inflammatory skin erosion. Symptoms were treated by applying mupirocin 2% ointment twice a day for several weeks and using sunscreen on the erosion and surrounding skin (93074). In one clinical trial, use of 0.5% apple cider vinegar soaks commonly caused skin irritation. One patient in this study experienced a nonpruritic papular rash, while another patient experienced severe pruritis with burning and erosion (101172). In another report, a female had an apple cider vinegar tablet lodged in the throat for 30 minutes, resulting in tenderness and pain in the larynx and difficulty swallowing for 6 months following the incident. This was thought to be due to the acid content of the tablet (13183).\nless\nRenal\nThere is one published report of an individual who developed hypokalemia, elevated renin levels, high positive urinary anion gap, and osteoporosis after ingesting apple cider vinegar 250 mL per day for 6 years. The osteoporosis was attributed to buffering of the acute acid load by bone, and the other effects were attributed to significant bicarbonate excretion (31730).\nless",

Although there has been interest in using topical apple cider vinegar for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of apple cider vinegar for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral apple cider vinegar is beneficial for improving endurance during exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of healthy male athletes shows that drinking apple cider vinegar 500 mL one-hour prior to an endurance cycling test does not improve endurance capacity, as measured by respiratory exchange rate, heart rate, or blood levels of ammonia, glucose, or lactate, when compared with a commercial sports drink (103225).

However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding and poor study methodology.\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral apple cider vinegar for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of apple cider vinegar for this condition.\nDiabetes. Some studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may have a beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, but data are limited due to high risk of bias and conflicting findings.\nA recent meta-analysis of 7 mostly low quality clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking oral apple cider vinegar 14-30 mL daily for 4-12 weeks reduces FBG by approximately 22 mg/dL and HbA1c by 1.5%, when compared with control. Additionally, the meta-analysis identified a dose-response relationship where each additional milliliter of apple cider vinegar consumed daily corresponded to a 1.3 mg/dL decrease in FBG, with doses exceeding 10 mL per day showing the greatest glucose-lowering effects (116177). However the validity of these findings is limited by a high risk of bias in most of the included studies and high heterogeneity for some outcomes, including effect on HbA1c.\n\nAdditionally, two meta-analyses of mainly lower-quality clinical trials in a variety of populations (i.e., healthy, overweight, or obese individuals or those with type 2 diabetes) show that taking apple cider vinegar daily for up to 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels by about 8-21 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.5%-0.9%, and total cholesterol by 6-7 mg/dL when compared with control (e.g., water, another beverage, no beverage, or restricted calorie diet). However, in sub-group analyses limited to patients with type 2 diabetes, the effect of apple cider vinegar on FBG or HbA1c levels is conflicting (106284, 112355). Of note, both meta-analyses include studies with heterogeneous populations, varied dosages, and different durations that limit the interpretation of these pooled results.\n\nSmall clinical studies show varying results. One small open-label clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking apple cider vinegar 30 mL daily for 8 weeks reduces HbA1c by about 1.4% but does not impact fasting blood glucose when compared with control (113626). Notably, baseline HbA1c was about 9% in the apple cider vinegar group versus about 8% in the control group. It is unclear if modifications to antidiabetes medications were allowed during study enrollment. Additionally, a very small clinical study shows that taking apple cider vinegar 20 grams with a meal increases postprandial insulin sensitivity and reduces postprandial flux in insulin levels in patients with insulin resistance, but not those with type 2 diabetes, when compared with placebo (17614). Additionally, a very small clinical study shows that taking apple cider vinegar 20 grams with a meal increases postprandial insulin sensitivity and reduces postprandial flux in insulin levels in patients with insulin resistance, but not those with type 2 diabetes, when compared with placebo (17614).\n\nIt is unclear if the formulation of apple cider vinegar alters its effects. One small crossover study in healthy adults found a modestly greater reduction in postprandial glucose with the use of liquid apple cider vinegar (providing 1.25 grams acetic acid) when compared with apple cider vinegar whole tablets or crushed tablets (providing 1.5 grams acetic acid) or water alone (106285). Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.\nless\nDyspepsia.

However, there is currently no clinical evidence confirming this association, or any studies specifically evaluating the use of apple cider vinegar for this purpose.\nless\nLeg cramps. Although there has been interest in using oral apple cider vinegar for leg cramps, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of apple cider vinegar for this condition.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral apple cider vinegar is beneficial for obesity.\nA small clinical study in adults with overweight and obesity shows that taking apple cider vinegar 15 mL twice daily for 12 weeks along with a calorie-restricted diet helps control appetite and modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BMI), and hip girth when compared with a restricted calorie diet alone. Taking apple cider vinegar along with dieting also appears to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and decrease triglyceride levels, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, when compared to dieting alone (97310). Additionally, a small clinical study conducted in Lebanon in adolescents and young adults with overweight and obesity shows that taking 5, 10, or 15 mL of apple cider vinegar diluted in water every morning for 12 weeks modestly reduces weight and BMI when compared with placebo, with the greatest reduction observed with the 15 mL dose. Taking apple cider vinegar also modestly reduced fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and serum cholesterol levels when compared with placebo(115305). Another small open-label clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking apple cider vinegar 30 mL daily for 8 weeks reduces BMI and waist circumference but does not change waist-to-hip ratio when compared with control (113626).

Laboratory analysis of commercially available apple cider vinegar tablets shows wide variation in contents and acidity. Amounts of acetic acid ranged from about 1% to 10.57%. Amounts of citric acid ranged from 0% to about 18.5%. Amounts of constituents listed on the product labels were not consistent with the laboratory findings. In the U.S., there is no regulatory standard for identifying vinegar products. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from these analyses whether these commercial products actually contain any apple cider vinegar (13183).\n\nApple cider vinegar can be produced by several methods, including the commercial/industrial method and the slower artisanal method. The artisanal process utilizes apple fruits and naturally occurring yeast microflora to ferment apple sugars in the absence of oxygen. Wood barrels introduce oxygen, which allows naturally occurring acetic bacteria to convert alcohol into acetic acid. The commercial process adds yeast to apple juice for alcohol production, followed by the incorporation of oxygen via a high-speed motor, which allows acetic bacteria to transform alcohol into acetic acid. An analysis of apple cider vinegar products suggests that the artisanal method produces a higher pH, as well as higher concentrations of mineral elements, vitamin C, total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content (107805).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nApple cider vinegar is fermented juice from crushed apples. Like apple juice, it likely contains some pectin, vitamin B1, B2, and B6, biotin, and niacin. Organic acids polyphenols formed through fermentation by hydrolysis, microbial activity, and biochemical metabolism include acetic acid, ascorbic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, citric acid, folic acid, fumaric acid, gallic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, myricetin, naringenin, pantothenic acid, oxalic acid, and vitamin C. It also contains small amounts of sodium, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium (5912, 13183, 113627). The production method and apple cultivar can lead to variability in constituent concentration, physiochemical properties, chemical composition, and biological properties (107805, 113627). Apple cider vinegar is chemically different from vinegars derived from other sources (31729).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that administration of apple cider vinegar reduces carrageenan-induced inflammation by up to 38% when compared with vehicle, but not as much as diclofenac. Researchers theorize that apple cider vinegar inhibits cyclooxygenase-1, disrupts prostaglandin synthesis, and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 (113627).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn humans, taking apple cider vinegar 20-25 grams with a meal significantly increases postprandial insulin sensitivity and reduces postprandial glucose levels and flux in insulin levels (17614, 106285). However, most research suggests that apple cider vinegar does not affect fasting blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (106284). Feeding apple cider vinegar to animals with experimentally induced diabetes significantly reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (17608). Additionally, in rats fed a high fat diet, apple cider vinegar improved insulin resistance and glucose levels (111231).\n\nApple cider vinegar is thought to affect glucose levels by delaying the gastric emptying (17609). Acetic acid in vinegar also seems to suppress disaccharidase activity and increase glucose-6-phosphate levels in skeletal muscle. Therefore, it is thought that vinegar might also work by preventing carbohydrate breakdown, similar to the prescription drug acarbose (17614). In vitro research suggests that apple cider vinegar produced via the artisanal method may have greater inhibitory activity against alpha-glucoside and alpha-amylase enzymes when compared with apple cider vinegar produced via the industrial method (107805).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that apple vinegar has antimicrobial effects against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Researchers theorize that the antimicrobial effects are due to the high acid content of apple cider vinegar (113627).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that apple cider vinegar exhibits antioxidant activity, and apple cider vinegar produced via the artisanal method has greater antioxidant activity than apple cider vinegar produced via the industrial method (107805, 113627). In vitro research suggests that the phenolic content of apple cider vinegar is strongly correlated with antioxidant activity (113627).\nDermatological effects\nTopical apple cider vinegar is of interest for atopic dermatitis. The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis is often colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and exhibits reduced microbial diversity. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to inhibit the growth of S. aureus in vitro and improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis in animal models. However, in human research the use of a dilute topical apple cider vinegar for 14 days does not affect skin microbial diversity or S. aureus levels (106283).\nImmunologic effects\nClinical research shows that consuming a high short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) diet of dietary fermentable fiber including resistant starch, inulin, and apple cider vinegar for 3 weeks may increase circulating immune cells when compared with a low-SCFA diet. The small clinical study shows that a high-SCFA diet may lead to higher fecal SCFA concentrations, plasma propionate, plasma butyrate, and lower fecal ammonia concentrations when compared with a low-SCFA diet. Furthermore, the study shows lower total B cells, naïve B cells, T helper cells, T follicular helper cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells in the blood of subjects ingesting a high-SCFA diet when compared with a low-SCFA diet. Researchers theorize that the reduced immune cells may give rise to an anti-inflammatory effect associated with increased dietary SCFA intake (110603). However, it is unclear if these findings are due to apple cider vinegar, other ingredients, or the combination.\nLipid effects\nIn clinical research, taking apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks was associated with an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a decrease in triglyceride levels, but with no change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels or the LDL/HDL ratio (97310). Feeding apple cider vinegar to animals with experimentally-induced diabetes reduces LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increases HDL cholesterol (17608). In another animal model, apple cider vinegar decreased triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. However, use of apple cider vinegar increased total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol (17615).\nNeurological effects\nApple cider vinegar is of interest for depression. In healthy adults, taking apple cider vinegar improved feelings of depressive mood. These improvements were related to changes in some measures of metabolism. However, the specific mechanism of action is unclear (106286).\nRenal effects\nThere is some interest in using apple cider vinegar to prevent kidney stones. It is hypothesized that apple cider vinegar may alkalinize the urine and demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity in the kidneys. Some population research suggests that the consumption of fermented vinegar can reduce the risk for kidney stones (97311). However, there is currently no clinical evidence confirming this association, or any studies specifically evaluating the use of apple cider vinegar for this purpose.\nReproductive effects\nIn a rat model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with atrophied ovaries, apple cider vinegar increases estradiol, primordial follicles, small primary follicles, and ovarian kisspeptin expression (111231).\nWeight loss effects\nApple cider vinegar is of interest for weight loss. Some research suggests that apple cider vinegar increases satiety and/or energy expenditure. However, one study in humans suggests that taking apple cider vinegar 30 mL daily for 4 days does not affect energy expenditure at rest or while exercising, or alter the use of carbohydrates or fats as energy (106282)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Preliminary clinical research in adults with moderate or severe persistent allergic rhinitis due to dust mite allergy shows that taking a specific supplement (Applephenon, Asahi Food and Healthcare Ltd) containing apple polyphenols 50 mg or 200 mg in a drink daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency of sneezing attacks when compared with placebo. The higher 200 mg dose also reduces nasal discharge when compared with placebo (94859). Preliminary clinical research in patients with allergic rhinitis caused by Japanese cedar shows that taking apple polyphenol 500 mg once daily for 12 weeks, beginning about 2 weeks prior to cedar pollen dispersion, reduces sneezing, but not symptoms such as rhinorrhea and eye itching, when compared with placebo (94861).\nAndrogenic alopecia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with male pattern baldness shows that applying 1.8 mL of apple polyphenol procyanidin 0.7% to 1% twice daily to the scalp for 6-12 months increases hair growth when compared with placebo (94860, 94867).\nAthletic performance. Clinical research in healthy physically active males shows that taking a specific supplement (Vinitrox, Nexira) containing 500 mg apple and grape polyphenols two times prior to an endurance test results in a 10% increase in time to exhaustion, or about 3 additional minutes, when compared with placebo. However, there were no differences between groups in recovery time and muscle pain (94858).\nHyperlipidemia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that consuming lyophilized apples containing polyphenols 1.43 grams daily for 4 weeks does not affect cholesterol levels or brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) when compared with consuming apples containing polyphenols 0.21 grams (94856). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking 2 capsules of a specific supplement (AppleMetS) containing 400 mg of apple polyphenolic extract per capsule daily for 8 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia when compared to baseline (94869). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nHypertension. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension or borderline hypertension shows that taking an apple polyphenol extract 330 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve blood pressure or endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), when compared with placebo (102020). However, given the small study size and that blood pressure was a secondary endpoint, it is likely the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nObesity. Clinical research in healthy, overweight adults shows that drinking a beverage containing 600 mg of a specific apple polyphenol product (Applephenon, Asahi Food and Healthcare, Ltd.) daily for 12 weeks reduces total fat when compared with placebo (94855). Additional clinical research in adults with a body mass index (BMI) in the range of 23-30 shows that taking apple polyphenol 600 mg before dinner for 12 weeks reduces visceral fat when compared to control (94863).\nMore evidence is needed to rate apple polyphenols for these uses.",

The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of Applephenon, an apple-derived substance containing polyphenols, is greater than 2000 mg/kg after a consecutive oral administration toxicity test in rats over the course of approximately 90 days (31681).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral intake, apple polyphenols are absorbed by the gut as aglycones (94870). Salivary digestion with amylase seems to play an important role in the extraction and absorption of some apple polyphenols, such as rutin and phlorizin, from apples (94868). After consuming 1 kg of apples, phloretin, an apple polyphenol, reached a maximum serum concentration of 13 nmol/L after about 1.7 hours (94867). After intake of 250 mL of apple juice enriched with 750 mg of apple polyphenols, the time to maximum serum concentration was around 1 hour for breakdown products of vanillic acid, quinic acid, and cinnamic acid, around 2 hours for breakdown products of phloretin and epicatechin, and at least 5 hours for propionic acid, acetic acid, valerolactone, and hippuric acid metabolites (102021).\nMetabolism\nAfter chemical modification via methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation, apple polyphenols and their metabolites are released into the blood (94870, 102021).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nApple polyphenols are phytochemicals extracted from apples that are considered to have various therapeutic benefits. Some examples of apple polyphenols include phlorizin, phloretin, procyanidins, quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, cinnamic acid, rutin, vanillic acid, and others (94862, 94864, 94423, 101000, 102021, 105737). Apple polyphenols are present in the highest concentration in the apple peel (94868).\nAntiallergic effects\nThe polyphenols and oligomeric procyanidins found in apple might have an effect on regulating allergic reactions (31690). This is possibly due to preventing the breakdown or use of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes (31681).\nAntidiabetic effects\nApple polyphenols have been suggested for use in diabetes. Effects on blood glucose may be mediated through inhibition of glucose absorption via alpha-amylases and alpha-glucosidases, delay in carbohydrate breakdown, and inhibition of intestinal glucose transporters (105738). In vitro research shows that the apple polyphenol phlorizin is a competitive sodium D-glucose co-transporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2) inhibitor, which reduces glucose uptake in the kidneys (94864). Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking apple polyphenols 600 mg daily for 12 weeks seems to lower blood glucose levels, but does not affect glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (94865). Additional clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking an apple preparation high in polyphenols (1.26-16 mg/100 mg of phlorizin) as a single dose reduces blood glucose levels (94862, 94864). Another small study in healthy adults shows that taking a phlorizin-rich apple polyphenol extract (Appl'In, Diana Food Ltd) 900-1800 mg prior to a meal decreases early postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels and delays time to peak blood glucose levels, but has no effect on maximum and late postprandial blood glucose levels or on gastric emptying (105738).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal and preliminary clinical research shows that apple polyphenols have antioxidant activity, which may explain some of its therapeutic effects (102020, 102022). Procyanidins specifically have been suggested to possess antioxidant activity, with strong protective effects against both reactive oxygen species and free radicals (105737).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using apple polyphenols for cardiovascular benefits. While preliminary evidence suggests that apple polyphenols may not improve blood pressure or arterial stiffness, there is mixed evidence suggesting that they might improve endothelial function, likely through antioxidant activity and increased nitric oxide production in endothelial cells (99446, 102020).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using apple polyphenols to minimize UV irradiation-induced skin damage. Preliminary clinical research in healthy females 20-39 years of age in Japan shows that taking a specific supplement (Applephenon, Asahi Breweries Co. Ltd) containing apple polyphenols 300 mg or 600 mg daily for 12 weeks inhibits UV irradiation-induced pigmentation changes by attenuating increases in erythema and melanin values and decreases in skin lightness when compared with placebo. Also, taking this product does not appear to affect water content or trans-epidermal water loss in facial skin when compared with placebo (105737).\nGastroprotective effects\nSome animal research suggests that apple polyphenols have gastroprotective effects through antioxidant activity. In a rat model of indomethacin-induced gastric damage, administration of apple polyphenols limited the development of gastric lesions, likely through antioxidant effects and modulation of MAPK signaling proteins (102022).\nLipid effects\nThere is interest in using apple polyphenols to reduce serum lipid levels, although clinical research on the lipid-lowering effects of apple polyphenols is mixed (94856, 94869). Some evidence suggests that apple polyphenols might decrease lipid levels by slowing fat absorption and inhibiting cholesterol uptake in the intestine (94855, 94863, 94868). Additional in vitro research shows that apple polyphenols stimulate the lipolysis and beta-oxidation of membrane lipids, with the latter producing short chain acyl-carnitines which then inhibit the production of cholesterol and other fatty acids by diverting acetyl-coenzyme A and citrate to the Kreb's cycle (101000).\nMetabolic effects\nApple polyphenols have been used for weight loss. In vitro research shows that apple polyphenols inhibit pancreatic lipase activity and can prevent fat from becoming soluble (94855). This suggests that apple polyphenols can slow fat absorption and promote weight loss (94863). Furthermore, a large percentage of apple polyphenols seem to accumulate in the intestinal lumen. This accumulation can inhibit cholesterol uptake and reduce cholesterol levels in the blood (94868).\nUric acid effects\nIn vitro research shows that apple polyphenol extract inhibits xanthine oxidase activity and reduces uric acid production, although to a lesser degree than allopurinol. Clinical research also shows that taking 300 mg of apple extract (Malus Domestica, Amitalia Srl) with 90% glycosylated polyphenols resulted in lower uric acid levels in the blood when compared to placebo (94857). Theoretically, apple polyphenol intake might reduce the risk for gout attacks."

A purified and semi-synthetic form of amygdalin is known as laetrile; both compounds may be associated with cyanide poisoning (94064, 94065). The term vitamin B-17 was coined in 1970, referring to both amygdalin and laetrile (65115). This term may have been used to skirt FDA drug regulations which do not apply to vitamins, but in 1987, amygdalin was ruled to be an unapproved drug (6672, 65115). Apricot kernel extract or oil is sometimes used as a flavoring in liqueur or in topical products.",
            "Warnings": "Laetrile and amygdalin are not approved by the FDA for any use in the United States due to the concern for cyanide toxicity (31768, 65117, 65119, 65123).

The oral bioavailability of prunasin, a metabolite of amygdalin, is approximately 50% (31759). Repeated oral administration of amygdalin 500 mg tablets in cancer patients increased whole blood cyanide levels by approximately 1 mcg/mL (range 0-3 mcg/mL) (65122).\nMetabolism\nWhen amygdalin interacts with the enzyme beta-glucosidase or undergoes hydrolysis in the absence of enzymes, hydrogen cyanide, benzaldehyde, and glucose are produced (4, 31756). Prunasin, the major metabolite of amygdalin, can also produce cyanide (31759, 65120). Cyanide is detoxified by the enzyme rhodanese to thiocyanate. There are case reports of thiocyanate content in the blood, urine, saliva, sweat, and tears of individuals after consuming apricot kernels.

Apricot kernel contains cyanogenic glycosides, which release hydrogen cyanide upon hydrolysis, a process known as cyanogenesis (94065). The kernel contains the glycoside amygdalin which can be metabolized to hydrocyanic acid (HCN) or cyanide (6). The amount of hydrogen cyanide can vary amongst different samples due to differences in climate conditions, soil, fertilization processes, and the age of the plant (94065).\nAnticancer effects\nIt is hypothesized that amygdalin, a constituent of apricot kernel, might inhibit cancer via the production of cyanide. When amygdalin interacts with the enzyme beta-glucosidase or undergoes hydrolysis in the absence of enzymes, hydrogen cyanide, benzaldehyde, and glucose are produced (65115). Originally, this was purported to be beneficial in cancer because cancer cells were thought to contain elevated amounts of beta-glucosidase and reduced levels of rhodanese compared to normal cells (65115, 65118, 65122). Beta-glucosidase catalyzes the release of cyanide from amygdalin, whereas rhodanese promotes the breakdown of cyanide into thiocyanate, a harmless chemical. However, this theory was proven to be false when it was discovered that rhodanese levels are the same in normal and cancerous tissues and only trace amounts of beta-glucosidase have been found in animal tissues. The theory was then modified, and it was proposed that the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, not beta-glucosidase, was more abundant in malignant cancer cells. Because of this, it was speculated that laetrile released cyanide because it contained a glucuronide bond. However, it has been determined that beta-glucuronidase is not more abundant in cancer cells. Additionally, laetrile contains amygdalin, which has a glucoside bond (65115).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is some interest in apricot kernels for improving lipid levels. A small clinical study in healthy females shows that taking apricot seeds 60 mg/kg (containing 5.8% amygdalin) daily in 8-12 doses for 42 days may slightly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when compared with baseline. Other lipid parameters do not seem to be affected (105900). This finding is limited by the lack of a control group and safety assessment."

The structure of arabinoxylan consists of a xylose backbone with arabinose side chains (25665).\nGastrointestinal effects\nArabinoxylan has been evaluated for its effects on overall gut health and the composition of the gut microbiota, with mixed findings. Clinical research in children and adults shows that consuming arabinoxylan 5-10 grams daily for 3 weeks has a prebiotic effect, resulting in an increased intestinal concentration of bifidobacteria (99672, 99674, 99676, 99677, 105749).

Other clinical research shows that short-term, 2-day supplementation with arabinoxylan 9.4 grams twice daily increases colonic carbohydrate fermentation (99680). Another clinical study in healthy adults with slow gut transit times but without constipation shows that taking a specific powder of arabinoxylan oligosaccharide (AXOS, Cargill) 5 grams three times daily with meals for 12 weeks significantly alters the composition of gut microbiota, resulting in a reduction in microbial alpha-diversity and an increase in levels of bifidobacteria. However, this product did not improve gut transit times, gastric emptying times, or stool parameters aside from softer stool consistency when compared with placebo (105749).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking a specific arabinoxylan extract from wheat endosperm (Naxus, Bioactor BV) 12 grams daily for 6 weeks does not strengthen the intestinal barrier against indomethacin-induced hyperpermeability when compared with placebo. Most of the adults enrolled in this study were found to have insufficient fiber intake at baseline (105750).\nHypoglycemic effects\nClinical research suggests that arabinoxylan reduces postprandial glucose levels in healthy volunteers and adults with metabolic syndrome (25665, 25666, 25668, 25669, 99673, 99675). Additional clinical research shows that consuming arabinoxylan in the evening can reduce postprandial glucose levels during breakfast the next morning (99674).This effect has been attributed to the ability of arabinoxylan to slow gastric emptying and reduce small intestinal motility, resulting in delayed glucose absorption (25665, 25666, 25668). However, other research shows that taking arabinoxylan 9.4 grams twice daily for 2 days does not affect gastric transit time (99680).\nHypolipidemic effects\nClinical research suggests that arabinoxylan can lower serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein A-1 (25668, 25669).

The FDA will detain, without physical examination, any product which contains plants known or suspected to contain aristolochic acid, or which might be adulterated with plants known to contain aristolochic acid. Each detained product is released only after the manufacturer provides direct, analytical evidence that it is free of aristolochic acid (6118). Aristolochia products have also been banned in Canada, Germany, Austria, France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Japan (367, 32307). Despite these bans, aristolochic acid-containing supplements, as well as guidance for the harvesting and preparation of wild aristolochia, remain available on the internet (100336).

Topically, arnica can cause contact itchiness, dry skin, and rash (17113). Oral lesions resulted in a woman who used a mouthwash incorrectly by not following dilution instructions. The mouthwash was 70% alcohol and contained arnica and oil of peppermint (19106).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, arnica can cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (11, 17113, 19101, 19102). Homeopathic arnica has been reported to cause dry mouth (30C) and sore tongue (6C) (19107). A 24-year-old female presented to the emergency department with palpitations and vomiting 24 hours after ingesting a cup of tea that reportedly contained arnica flowers picked from her local area of mountainous Southern California. The species was not specified in the article and there was no indication by the authors that any testing had been done to confirm the identity of the plant (90610).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nAdverse effects after ingesting arnica include muscle weakness (19101). Homeopathic arnica has been reported to result in the feeling of a \"throbby\" head or neck (19107).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, arnica may cause drowsiness, nervousness, and headache (11, 17113, 19101, 19107).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn a case report, accidental intake of a large amount of a homeopathic Arnica-30 resulted in acute vision loss due to bilateral toxic optic neuropathy (19105).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOral homeopathic arnica (6C) may cause depressed feelings, specifically a feeling of unhappiness (19107).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, arnica can cause shortness of breath (11, 17113).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Topical arnica gel might reduce osteoarthritis pain.\nOne open-label clinical trial shows that applying arnica gel (A. Vogel Arnica Gel, Bioforce AG) twice daily for 3 weeks decreases total symptom scores, including pain, stiffness, and restriction-of-function, when compared to baseline (19112). A larger randomized clinical trial shows that applying the same gel is as effective as ibuprofen for reducing the intensity of pain and improving hand function (19108).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there is interest in using topical arnica for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of arnica for this purpose.\nBleeding. It is unclear if oral arnica reduces bleeding after surgery.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing total mastectomy for breast cancer suggests that sublingual treatment with 5 drops of a homeopathic preparation of arnica extract (Arnica 1000 K) three times daily for 6 days might reduce the volume of blood and serum drainage by 95 mL over 5 days when compared with placebo (96769). However, because this product is a dilute homeopathic preparation, there is unlikely to be any arnica in the doses given. There is speculation that the slightly higher mean weight of the patients in the arnica group, rather than any effects of arnica itself, might have led to the statistically significant findings (96768).\nless\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. Oral homeopathic arnica has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in females with non-metastatic breast cancer treated with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor shows that taking a specific homeopathic medicine (Actheane, Laboratories Boiron) daily for 3 months does not reduce hot flashes when compared with placebo. This product contains 4CH each of arnica, black cohosh, bloodroot, and nitroglycerin and 5CH of snake Lachesis muta (103004).\nless\nBruises. Most small clinical trials show that neither topical nor oral arnica reduces postoperative bruising.\nMost clinical research shows that topical products containing arnica 10%, as well as homeopathic oral products such as tablets, globules, and capsules, are not effective for reducing postoperative bruising (19107, 19119, 19120, 19121, 19122, 19123, 19124, 90611, 96769, 96772). However, some conflicting research shows benefit. One clinical study shows that applying arnica 20% ointment 0.25 grams twice daily for 2 weeks reduces laser-induced bruising when compared to white petrolatum ointment (19125). Another clinical study shows that applying a specific arnica cream (Arnica Krem 75 g, MediTech) four times daily reduces periorbital bruising in the first week after rhinoplasty when compared with no local treatment (96773).\n\nOne small study has also evaluated oral homeopathic arnica. In females undergoing a face-lift, taking a specific homeopathic oral arnica product (SinEcch, Alpine Pharmaceuticals) may reduce bruising on postoperative days 1 and 7 when compared with placebo (19124).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral homeopathic arnica may reduce symptoms of diabetic retinopathy.\nTwo preliminary clinical trials in patients with diabetic retinopathy associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes shows that taking three pearls of homeopathic arnica 5C orally for 6 months might modestly improve measures of vision when compared with placebo (19110, 19111).\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if eye drops containing arnica extract can improve dry eye in children.\nA small observational study in children aged 9-14 years with dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis suggests that applying eye drops containing hyaluronic acid 0.2% and arnica extract 0.1% three times daily for four weeks is associated with improvements in subjective and objective measures of dry eye severity when compared to baseline. Improvements in these outcomes were smaller and mostly non-significant in patients using eye drops containing hyaluronic acid only (111421). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of between-group analysis and randomization.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Small studies suggest that oral homeopathic arnica does not reduce muscle soreness after exercise. It is unclear if topical arnica is beneficial.\nDespite some conflicting evidence (19135), most clinical research shows that taking homeopathic arnica formulations orally does not prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness (19129, 19130, 19131, 19132, 19133).\n\nResearch on the use of topical arnica formulations is conflicting. One small study in trained athletes shows that using a gel containing 25 mg of dry arnica herb on muscles immediately after a run and then every 4 hours while awake for 5 days improves muscle tenderness and pain by a small amount after 3 days, but not at other time points, when compared with placebo (90612). However, another small study suggests that applying arnica 7% cream (Boiron Group) increases muscle pain following calf raises when compared with placebo (17113).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Findings related to the use of oral homeopathic arnica are mixed; most studies utilizing a placebo control have yielded negative results.\nMany small clinical studies show that taking homeopathic arnica preparations orally modestly reduces postoperative pain following tonsillectomy, knee surgery, and carpal tunnel release when compared with baseline or control. Most studies have used homeopathic arnica in dilutions of 30C, 30X, D6, or D4, for up to two weeks postoperatively (19102, 19114, 19115, 19116). In one study, oral homeopathic arnica has been used along with arnica 5% ointment from 72 hours after surgery for up to 2 weeks (19116). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo comparator. Studies utilizing a placebo or active control have not yielded positive results. Clinical research in patients recovering from carpal tunnel surgery shows that taking a homeopathic Arnica montana solution by mouth is no more effective than taking placebo for reducing postoperative pain and bruising (19107). Other clinical research shows that taking homeopathic arnica 30C for 5 days after total abdominal hysterectomy does not reduce postoperative pain when compared with placebo and usual treatment (19117). Also, homeopathic arnica D4 is inferior to diclofenac following bunion surgery (109102). Some clinical research in patients recovering from a knee ligament reconstruction shows that a homeopathic solution containing Arnica montana 5 CH, Bryonia alba 5 CH, Hypericum perforatum 5 CH, and Ruta graveolens 3 DH is no more effective than placebo for reducing analgesic use (32413).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral homeopathic arnica is beneficial for postoperative recovery.\nOne meta-analysis of small- to moderate-sized clinical trials shows that taking homeopathic arnica does not improve postoperative recovery when compared with controls. Recovery endpoints were combined and included pain, swelling, bruising, wound healing, and others (109061).\nless\nPostoperative swelling. It is unclear if topical arnica reduces swelling after surgery.\nOne clinical study shows that applying arnica 10% ointment following blepharoplasty does not reduce postoperative swelling when compared with using a placebo ointment (96772). However, lower quality studies have yielded more promising results. One small clinical study shows that applying a specific arnica cream (Arnica Krem 75 g, MediTech) four times daily reduces swelling by a small amount in the first week after rhinoplasty when compared with no local treatment (96773). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo control. A small retrospective study suggests that using a topical homeopathic preparation containing arnica 50M and marsh tea 50M (OcuMend, Cearna Inc.) is associated with reduced postoperative swelling after oculofacial surgery (96770); however, this study is limited by poor design (96771).\nless\nStroke. A small study suggests that oral homeopathic arnica does not improve outcomes after stroke.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking one tablet of arnica 30C sublingually every 2 hours for six doses doesn't benefit stroke patients (19126). Endpoints included level of consciousness, mobility, incontinence, social performance, and mental state.\nless\nTooth extraction. It is unclear if oral homeopathic arnica improves symptoms after tooth extraction in adults or children.\nA small clinical trial in children aged 8-12 years undergoing two sessions of tooth extraction in different parts of the mouth shows that taking homeopathic arnica 30 minutes prior to the procedure, and then 3 times daily for 72 hours, is as effective as taking ibuprofen for reducing patient-reported and operator-assessed pain levels 24 hours after extraction. However, 48 hours after extraction, ibuprofen was more effective. Each child was provided with both arnica and weight-based doses of ibuprofen in a crossover manner while undergoing two sessions of tooth extraction in different parts of the mouth ten days apart (109224). A small observational study in adults undergoing third molar extractions suggests that taking homeopathic arnica 30X (Hyland's Inc.) 4 tablets before the procedure and then 4 tablets four times daily for 4 days after the procedure is associated with less pain, bleeding, and swelling when compared with standard treatment alone (105062). However, the validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo control.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate arnica for these uses.",

The highest levels of sesquiterpene lactones are found in the disk flowers of the plant and the lowest in the stem (32400). Lignans have been isolated from the roots and rhizomes of arnica (32409). Other constituents of arnica include flavonoids (32408), caffeic acid derivatives (32408) , and 11alpha,13-dihydro-2-O-tigloyl and 2-O-isovaleryl florilenalin (32407).\nAnalgesic effects\nThe active sesquiterpene lactones constituents seem to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and platelet-inhibitory effects (102, 104, 17113).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe active sesquiterpene lactones constituents seem to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and platelet-inhibitory effects (102, 104, 17113). As shown in laboratory research, the sesquiterpene lactones may inhibit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), which is involved in control of DNA transcription. This inhibition reduces synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, cyclooxygenase 2, and nitric oxide synthase (17113, 32398). In laboratory research, some sesquiterpene lactones had anti-inflammatory effects in animal models possibly by decreasing neutrophil migration and activity (32422). Also, some sesquiterpene lactones inhibit toll-like receptors (TLR4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins (NOD2) involved in inflammation (32418). In laboratory research, homeopathic preparations of arnica 6cH also reduced inflammation when applied prior to the inflammatory stimulus (32402).\nAntibiotic effects\nThe sesquiterpene lactones of arnica might have antibiotic activity (5).\nAnticoagulation effects\nThe active sesquiterpene lactones constituents seem to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and platelet-inhibitory effects (102, 104, 17113)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Arsenic is a trace element that occurs naturally in the diet (7135, 16309). Organic arsenic is generally non-toxic, while inorganic forms can have toxic effects (16316). Food sources of arsenic include seafood, poultry, grains (especially rice), bread, cereal products, mushrooms, and dairy products (7135, 16309, 16310, 16312, 99825). The estimated adult daily intake of organic arsenic from a typical diet is 12-50 mcg, and a dietary requirement of 12-25 mcg daily has been suggested (7135, 16309, 16310, 16312, 16313). A small amount of dietary arsenic is inorganic, with an estimated typical intake of 3.5-10 mcg daily (16312, 16313).\n\nArsenic has been used as a component of traditional Chinese medicine formulas or as a component of homeopathic remedies for the treatment of various conditions, including inflammatory disorders.",
            "Warnings": "Inorganic arsenic compounds, such as the trivalent arsenite salts and pentavalent arsenate salts, are established human poisons when ingested in large amounts or in amounts above typical dietary intake for prolonged periods (7135). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes inorganic arsenic as a known human carcinogen (99824). According to the World Health Organization and US EPA, the maximum permissible level of arsenic in drinking water is 10 mcg/L; this includes both organic and inorganic forms of arsenic (16316, 99827).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when organic arsenic is consumed in normal food amounts. Organic forms of arsenic normally found in foods have not been linked to toxicity (7135, 16309). ...when arsenic trioxide is used intravenously and appropriately under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox) is an FDA-approved prescription drug (15).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when inorganic arsenic is used orally, especially when used long-term or in high doses. Taking large doses acutely, or in small doses for prolonged periods of time, can cause serious side effects. Chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily has been associated with symptomatic arsenicism. Acute doses of 5 mg, or sometimes less, can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Higher doses can cause severe poisoning and death (7135, 16310, 16312, 16313, 16316, 102892). Prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water and other sources has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and mortality (99824, 99827, 99829, 99830, 99832, 99834, 99835, 109108, 109110). Inorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen (16312, 16316). The maximum permissible level of arsenic in drinking water is 10 mcg/L (16316).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when organic arsenic is consumed in food amounts. Organic forms of arsenic found in a normal diet have not been linked to toxicity (7135, 16309).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when inorganic arsenic is used orally, especially when used long-term or in high doses. Large doses acutely, or in small doses for prolonged periods of time, can cause serious side effects. Prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been linked to reduced scores on intelligence tests, developmental delays, impaired verbal comprehension, decreased memory and attention, and higher blood pressure in children (16319, 99826, 99828, 99836, 102898).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when organic arsenic is consumed in food amounts. Organic forms of arsenic found in a normal diet have not been linked to toxicity (7135, 16309).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when inorganic arsenic is taken orally, especially when used long-term or in high doses. While exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water does not seem to increase the risk of neural tube defects (102897), it has been associated with an increased risk for spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality (99833). Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water and other sources while pregnant has also been linked to changes in birth weight, length, and head circumference (102895), with one study showing that higher maternal blood arsenic levels are associated with 44% greater odds of delivering a small for gestational age infant and 103% greater odds of delivering a large for gestational age infant (102895, 102896). Avoid arsenic supplements and water contaminated with arsenic during pregnancy or lactation.",

However, high doses or chronic intake of inorganic arsenic is associated with potentially serious adverse effects.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: With the acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic, anemia, arrhythmias, bruising, gastrointestinal irritation or damage, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nWith chronic intake of inorganic arsenic, arsenicism can occur, including anorexia, cancer, skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis, and toxicity of the cardiovascular and neurological systems.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, doses of inorganic arsenic 1 mg/kg daily can cause hematopoietic depression including anemia, arrhythmias, and blood vessel damage leading to bruising (7135, 16309, 16312). Acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 10 mg/kg daily or more causes vasodilation and myocardial depression leading to myocardial injury, shock, and circulatory failure (17, 7135, 16313, 16316, 102892). Chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized in part by cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316). Prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water at levels greater than or equal to 20 mcg/L has been linked, in a dose-dependent manner, to a 9% to 43% greater risk of cardiovascular disease, 11% to 55% greater risk of coronary heart disease, and 16% to 90% greater risk of cardiovascular-related death (99827). Also, each interquartile increase in urinary inorganic arsenic levels is associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a specific area of the US (109110). A metabolite of arsenic, monomethylarsonic acid, has also been positively linked to stroke risk (99831). Increased exposure to inorganic arsenic has also been linked to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (99835). The cardiovascular adverse effects of inorganic arsenic appear to be more profound in males with hypertension (99829).\n\nThe association between arsenic exposure and hypertension has also been investigated. A meta-analysis of observational research has found that the odds of having hypertension and risk of hypertension were increased by 14% and 30%, respectively, in those with the highest arsenic exposure when compared with the lowest. Exposure was determined based on intake of rice and rice products, as well as exposure in water, or levels in urine, hair, or toenails (109108). Additionally, increased exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been linked to higher blood pressure in children (102898).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized in part by skin hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, alopecia, and occlusive peripheral vascular disease leading to gangrene (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316, 102894). In one case, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused eczema of the hands, arms, and legs (102893).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been associated with a 23% to 75% increase in the risk for diabetes (99830, 99834). For every 100 mcg/L increase in inorganic arsenic levels in drinking water, the associated risk for diabetes increases by 13% (99834). A small meta-analysis has found that overall exposure to arsenic, including organic and inorganic arsenic, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes (106539).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 5 mg, or sometimes less, can cause vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and flatulence (16316, 102893). These effects usually resolve in about 12 hours without treatment (16316). Doses of inorganic arsenic 1 mg/kg daily can cause gastrointestinal irritation (7135, 16309, 16312). Acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 10 mg/kg daily or more causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms including bloody rice-water diarrhea (17, 7135, 16313, 16316, 102892). Chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized in part by anorexia and gastrointestinal disturbances (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused irregular menstruation (102893). A long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased mortality from genitourinary diseases (106541).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized in part by anemia, leukopenia, and occlusive peripheral vascular disease (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, doses of inorganic arsenic 1 mg/kg daily can cause hepatotoxicity (7135, 16309, 16312).\n\nThe homeopathic remedy, arsenicum album, has been associated with three cases of acute liver injury. In one case, a 70-year-old male with pre-existing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis died following the acute liver injury associated with use of this compound for about 12 weeks. High levels of arsenic were found in his hair and nail samples. Symptoms in the two other individuals resolved upon discontinuation of homeopathic arsenic and use of corticosteroids (109114).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused leg cramps in one patient (102893).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, doses of inorganic arsenic 1 mg/kg daily can cause peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy (7135, 16309, 16312). In one case, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused headache, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating (102893). Acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 10 mg/kg daily or more can cause cerebral edema, leading to encephalopathy, convulsions, coma, and death (17, 7135, 16313, 16316). Chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized in part by sensory disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, confusion, and memory loss (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316). A long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased mortality from nervous system diseases (106541).\n\nIn children, prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been linked to reduced scores on intelligence tests, developmental delays, impaired verbal comprehension, and decreased memory and attention (16319, 99826, 99828, 99836).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused conjunctivitis in one patient (102893). A long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased mortality from traffic accidents. This is suggested to be related to a higher prevalence of visual field narrowing due to macular degeneration, as well as motor or sensory dysfunction, in those exposed to arsenic during infancy (106541).\nless\nOncologic\nInorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen (16312, 16316). Orally, chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, which can result in cancers of the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bladder (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316). Chronic ingestion of lower doses of inorganic arsenic, as a contaminant in well water, has also been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, kidneys, and lungs (7135, 99824, 99832, 106540). More specifically, levels of inorganic arsenic greater than 200 mcg/L in drinking water have been linked to lung cancer (99824). Levels of inorganic arsenic greater than 10 mcg/L in drinking water are also dose-dependently linked to an increased risk for bladder and kidney cancers (99832). A meta-analysis of observational research has found that arsenic exposure, especially from water and soil, is associated with prostate cancer risk (109109). A long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased mortality from liver cancer (106541).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, chronic intake of inorganic arsenic 30 ng daily has reportedly caused insomnia and anxiety in one patient (102893).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nA long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased mortality from respiratory diseases (106541).\nless\nOther\nOrally, high doses of inorganic arsenic can cause death. In one case, a 24-year-old female receiving a combination of arsenic trioxide, realgar, and mung bean flour from an illegal medical provider died within days of taking the compounded preparation. Laboratory analysis revealed the amount of arsenic consumed to be around 1.1 grams on day 1 and 0.9 grams on day 4. Researchers concluded that arsenic as the source of poisoning was clear based on the amount of arsenic ingested and the patient's clinical presentation prior to death, which included vomiting, diarrhea, reduced urine output, liver and kidney abnormalities, and myocardial injury (102892).\n\nA long-term observational study in adults has found that exposure to inorganic arsenic from consumption of contaminated milk powder during infancy is associated with increased all-cause mortality (106541).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrganic arsenic is generally non-toxic. However, inorganic arsenic, when taken chronically or in high doses, is associated with significant and potentially fatal toxicity and is classified as a human carcinogen (16312, 16316). Levels of toxicity vary among inorganic arsenic compounds, with estimates of lethal doses varying from 100-300 mg or from 0.6-10 mg/kg daily (17, 7135, 16316).\n\nAcute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 1 mg/kg daily can cause gastrointestinal irritation, hematopoietic depression, arrhythmias, bruising, peripheral neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, and encephalopathy (7135, 16309, 16312). Acute ingestion of inorganic arsenic 10 mg/kg daily or more causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, vasodilation, cerebral edema, shock, circulatory failure, and even death (17, 7135, 16313, 16316, 102892). Chronic intake of 10 mcg/kg daily of inorganic arsenic produces arsenicism, characterized by skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbances, sensory disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, occlusive peripheral vascular disease, encephalopathy, anemia, leukopenia, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and cancer (17, 7135, 16309, 16310, 16316, 102894).\n\nChronic ingestion of lower doses of inorganic arsenic, as a contaminant in well water, has also been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, kidneys, and lungs (7135, 99824, 99832). Exposure to arsenic in well water has also been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (16320, 99827, 99829, 99830, 99834, 99835, 102898).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with inorganic arsenic.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe majority of dietary arsenic is in an organic form and is 60% to 70% absorbed (7135). Occupational exposure to arsenic from copper or lead smelting, wood preservatives, and pesticides can lead to systemic absorption of inorganic arsenic (16312).\nDistribution\nIn cases of acute inorganic arsenic poisoning, arsenic is found in highest concentrations in the kidneys and liver. Upon chronic ingestion, inorganic arsenic accumulates in the liver, kidneys, heart, and lungs (16316). Exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic for 2 weeks or longer results in accumulation in the hair and nails, where it binds to keratin and can remain for years (16312, 16316).\nMetabolism\nInorganic arsenic is detoxified in the liver by methylation, but large doses can overwhelm this methylating capacity (16313). The methylation process utilizes S-adenosylmethionine (16318). This hepatic methylation forms monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsonic acid, which are less toxic metabolites (16316).\nExcretion\nOrganic arsenic is rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. About 50% of inorganic arsenic is eliminated in the urine unchanged or as metabolites in 3-5 days (16316).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nArsenic is a trace element that occurs naturally in the diet. Its role in the body is not well understood (7135, 16309). It may be involved in metabolism and recycling of methionine, in the function of taurine, and in regulation of gene expression (7135, 16309, 16310). Arsenic deprivation in animals is associated with impaired growth and reproduction, depression of S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase resulting in decreased hepatic S-adenosyl-methionine levels and increased hepatic S-adenosyl-homocysteine levels, and disruption of mitochondrial membranes in heart and skeletal muscle (7135, 16309, 16310).\nApoptotic effects\nIn the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide acts by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death). It releases an apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria (16316).\nCarcinogenic effects\nA number of mechanisms are responsible for the toxicity and carcinogenicity of inorganic arsenic compounds. Trivalent arsenic reacts with sulfhydryl groups in proteins, leading to inactivation of many enzymes, especially those involved in cellular energy pathways and in DNA replication and repair. Arsenic can get substituted for phosphate in high energy compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it accumulates in the mitochondria, and it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation (16313, 16316). Unbound arsenic generates reactive oxygen intermediates, causing lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (16316). Arsenites can inhibit DNA repair after ultraviolet damage, which may contribute to their carcinogenicity. Methylation of arsenic in the body can result in reduced methylation of DNA and potential damage (16313)."

Patients sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family may be at the greatest risk. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many other herbs. Topically, allergic contact dermatitis can occur with the use of artichoke. This has been attributed to the constituent cynaropicrin (11, 52206, 52226, 52230). Redness in the face (11774) and sweating (91475) have been reported rarely following oral use of artichoke extract.\n\nOccupational or airborne exposure to artichoke may also cause allergic reactions. In one case, a 52-year-old male presented with severe spongiotic dermatitis in exposed areas that was recurrent over the past 8 years. A patch test confirmed allergies to artichokes and sesquiterpene lactones, a group of allergens from the Compositae family, and the patient confirmed occupational and airborne exposure to artichokes during the time of his symptoms. The patient improved considerably after treatment with dupilumab (111565).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, artichoke extract might increase abdominal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea, hunger, and nausea in some patients (2562, 52238, 91475). Abdominal pain and a bitter taste in the mouth were reported by a single person following oral use of a dietary supplement containing artichoke extract, as well as red yeast rice, pine bark extract, and garlic extract (89452). It is not clear if this adverse effect was due to artichoke, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nIn one case report, the autopsy of an 84-year-old female revealed a colonic bezoar comprised of artichoke fiber and fragments. This bezoar caused complete intestinal obstruction, leading to fatal acute peritonitis.

Oral artichoke leaf extract may improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia or dyspepsia associated with biliary disease.\nSeveral clinical trials in patients with functional dyspepsia or dyspepsia associated with biliary disease show that taking artichoke leaf extract can reduce symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Improvement seems to occur after 2 to 8 weeks of treatment (2056, 11429, 12208). The validity of some of this evidence is limited by a small sample size (2056) or lack of a control group (11429). However, a higher-quality clinical trial in patients with mild dyspepsia shows that taking artichoke leaf extract 640 mg three times daily for 6 weeks improves overall symptom and quality of life scores. Specifically, patient ratings for flatulence, feelings of fullness, and early satiety were reduced when compared with placebo. Further, for every 12 patients treated with this extract over placebo, one additional patient reported markedly or completely improved symptoms (12208). Some studies have used a specific extract called ALE LI 220 (Hepar-SL forte, Serturner Arzneimittel GmbH) at doses ranging from 320-640 mg three times daily for up to 8 weeks (2056, 12208). Another study has used a different artichoke leaf extract (Cynara SL, Lichtwer Pharma) at a dose of 320-640 mg daily for 2 months (11429).\n\nSome clinical research has also assessed artichoke extract in combination with ginger extract.

Most research shows that oral artichoke lowers cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. However, frozen artichoke juice does not appear to have these effects.\nMultiple meta-analyses and clinical studies in patients who are either healthy or have hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or pre-obesity show that taking artichoke leaf extract or concentrated artichoke juice capsules daily for 4-24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 13-18 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15-17 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 9-18 mg/dL, but does not increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with placebo (104132, 108713, 111560, 111564). While the five studies including non-hyperlipidemic patients in one of these analyses reported mixed results, all four of the studies evaluating artichoke leaf extract in patients with hyperlipidemia showed significant reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo (104132). Additionally, a dose-response analysis suggests that baseline cholesterol levels are a stronger predictor of benefit than dose and treatment duration (108713). The validity of these findings is limited due to the high heterogeneity of studies included in meta-analyses. Another clinical study in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia shows that taking artichoke extract 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks decreases LDL cholesterol by about 11% and increases HDL cholesterol by about 10% when compared with placebo (91478).\n\nOther formulations have also been evaluated, including cynarin, a constituent of artichoke, and artichoke juice. Some older, small clinical studies suggest that taking cynarin 20 mg three times daily for 2-7 months reduces total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared to baseline in patients with hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia (52222, 52223, 52236). However, cynarin does not appear to reduce cholesterol levels in patients with familial type II hyperlipoproteinemia (1424). In patients with hyperlipidemia, consuming frozen artichoke juice 20-30 mL daily for 6-12 weeks does not appear to reduce total or LDL cholesterol levels and may even increase triglyceride levels (52216, 52234).\n\nArtichoke leaf extract has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research shows that taking a product containing red yeast rice extract, artichoke leaf extract, and other ingredients (Limicol, Laboratoire Lescuyer) 3 or 6 tablets daily for 4-16 weeks decreases LDL cholesterol by 14% to 21% in patients with hyperlipidemia. However, the red yeast in this product contains monacolin K (lovastatin), which likely contributed to the cholesterol-lowering effect (89451, 89452, 89454). Another specific product (Vazguard; Indena SpA), containing artichoke leaf extract (Indena SpA) 100 mg and bergamot phytosome 600 mg, has also shown benefit in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia when taken twice daily for 2 months (108712). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to artichoke leaf, bergamot, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBiliary disorders. Although there has been interest in using oral artichoke for various biliary disorders, including for the treatment of cholestasis or prevention of gallstones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of artichoke for these conditions.\nDiabetes. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral artichoke extract may slightly reduce fasting blood glucose, but may not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or other measures of glycemic control, in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical trials shows that taking artichoke leaf extract for 8-12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by around 5 mg/dL, but does not improve HbA1c, insulin levels, or markers of insulin resistance, when compared with placebo (105768). The generalizability of these findings to patients with diabetes is limited; only 2 of the 9 studies specifically enrolled patients with diabetes. The other studies included patients who were overweight or with liver disease, hyperlipidemia, or metabolic syndrome. In contrast, a post-hoc analysis of clinical research in overweight adults at risk for developing diabetes shows that taking a specific artichoke leaf product (Altilix, Bionap S.r.l.) 50 mg daily for 6 months reduces HbA1c by around 0.9% and improves measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function when compared with placebo (111564).\nless\nHangover. It is unclear if oral artichoke extract is beneficial for the prevention of hangover.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking artichoke extract 960 mg immediately before and after alcohol consumption does not prevent alcohol-induced hangover when compared with placebo (11774).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral artichoke is beneficial in patients with hepatitis C.\nOne small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis C shows that taking artichoke leaf extract 3200 mg daily for 12 weeks does not normalize liver enzyme levels or reduce viral load when compared to baseline. Although symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and joint problems appear to improve in the first 4 weeks, the improvement is not maintained over 12 weeks (91475). However, another small clinical study shows that drinking a tea infusion of wild artichoke three times daily for 3 months normalizes liver enzymes and serum virus levels in 12 of 15 patients with hepatitis C (97717). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nHypertension. Analyses of small clinical studies suggest that oral artichoke may slightly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension; however, individual study results are conflicting, and the improvements in blood pressure may not be clinically significant.\nEvidence regarding an association between artichoke consumption and hypertension is conflicting (91477, 104133, 105767, 111561). Two meta-analyses include many of the same studies yet reach contradictory conclusions. One meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials shows that taking artichoke leaf extract, powder, or juice for 8-12 weeks does not reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, subgroup analysis in patients with documented hypertension shows that artichoke reduces SBP by around 3 mmHg and DBP by around 2 mmHg when compared with placebo (105767).\n\nIn contrast, another meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials shows that taking artichoke 50-2700 mg daily for 4-12 weeks reduces SBP by about 2 mmHg and DBP by about 1.5 mmHg. Subgroup analysis shows that the greatest reductions in SBP and DBP occur in doses of 500 mg daily or less, at durations longer than 8 weeks, and in patients under 50 years old (111561).\n\nDiscrepancies between the results of the meta-analyses with overlapping studies may be due to the former meta-analysis including artichoke supplementation in combination with other ingredients, while the latter meta-analysis focused on artichoke supplementation alone.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral artichoke leaf extract is beneficial in patients with IBS.\nSome observational research in patients with IBS has found that taking a specific artichoke leaf extract (Hepar-SL forte, Serturner Arzneimittel GmbH) 640 mg three times daily for 6 weeks is associated with reductions in abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, flatulence, and constipation when compared to baseline (2562). Also, a small clinical study in patients with IBS shows that taking a different specific artichoke leaf extract (Cynara SL, Lichtwer Pharma) 320-640 mg daily for 2 months reduces the incidence of IBS symptoms in patients with dyspepsia by about 26% when compared to baseline. Patients taking this extract also had improved quality of life (15204). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral artichoke leaf extract is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking artichoke leaf extract 1800 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, taking artichoke extract does reduce triglycerides by around 27 mg/dL when compared with placebo (100935).\nless\nNausea and vomiting. Although there has been interest in using oral artichoke for nausea and vomiting, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of artichoke for this purpose.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral artichoke leaf extract is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nMeta-analyses of 12 clinical studies in adults with a variety of metabolic disorders, including NAFLD, show that taking artichoke 50-2700 mg daily for 4-24 weeks reduces alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) when compared with placebo (111560, 111563). These effects are greater for ALT in trials lasting 8 weeks or longer and for AST at doses over 500 mg daily (111563). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity among the included studies.\n\nA small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a specific artichoke leaf extract (Cynarol, Niak Pharmaceuticals), standardized to contain cynarin 2%, as 200 mg three times daily for 2 months improves NAFLD severity, reduces liver size, and increases hepatic vein flow when compared with placebo. The severity of NAFLD improved in 82% of patients taking artichoke, compared with 5% taking placebo. NAFLD severity did not worsen in any patients taking artichoke, compared with 27.5% of those taking placebo. Serum levels of liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and lipids were also improved with artichoke when compared with placebo (100934). However, the validity of these findings is limited by inappropriate randomization, the use of a per-protocol analysis, and significant differences between groups at baseline.\n\nArtichoke leaf extract has also been evaluated in combination with conventional therapies. A clinical trial shows that taking metformin 500 mg twice daily and/or vitamin E 400 IU once daily along with a specific artichoke leaf extract (Tishoke; Goldaru Company) 400 mg twice daily, providing 40 mg chlorogenic acid daily, for 12 weeks improves NAFLD severity and reduces liver size when compared with baseline. However, these improvements were similar to those seen in patients taking metformin with vitamin E. After 12 weeks, the number of patients with no fat accumulation (steatosis grade 0) increased by 23% in the artichoke and metformin group, 17% in the artichoke and vitamin E group, and 10% in the metformin and vitamin E group (108714)\nless\nObesity. A meta-analysis of several small clinical studies suggests that oral artichoke extract may slightly reduce waist circumference, but not body weight or body mass index (BMI), in patients who are overweight or obese.\nA meta-analysis of 10 small clinical trials shows that taking artichoke leaf extract, powder, or juice for 8-12 weeks reduces waist circumference by 1.11 cm, but does not improve body weight or BMI, when compared with placebo (105766). The generalizability of these findings to patients who are overweight or obese is limited by the fact that only 3 of the 10 trials specifically enrolled patients because they were overweight. Other studies evaluated patients with liver disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension. In contrast, a post-hoc analysis of clinical research in adults with overweight shows that taking an artichoke leaf supplement (Altilix, Bionap S.r.l.) 150 mg daily for 6 months reduces body weight by around 2.3 kg but does not improve waist circumference when compared with placebo (111564).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral artichoke for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of artichoke for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate artichoke for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nArtichoke leaf extract has been taken in doses ranging from 320-1920 mg daily for up to 12 weeks, with higher doses taken as three divided doses. Most commonly, artichoke leaf extract is taken at a dose of 320-640 mg three times daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nArtichoke extract is typically standardized to phenolic acid, sesquiterpene lactone, and flavonoid constituents. Some artichoke leaf extract contains up to 2% phenolic acids, primarily chlorogenic acid, cynarin, and caffeic acid; up to 4% sesquiterpene lactones including cynaropicrin; and 1% flavonoids including scolymoside, cynaroside, and luteolin (2056). One artichoke leaf extract used in clinical research was standardized to contain 0.2% caffeoylquinic acids, 0.5% flavonoids, and 0.5% cynaropicrin (91478). Another artichoke leaf extract used in clinical research was standardized to contain at least 4% to 5% chlorogenic acid (100935). Clinical research has also used a specific artichoke product (Tishoke; Goldaru Company) standardized to contain 400 mg of dried artichoke leaf extract and 20 mg of chlorogenic acid per capsule (108714).\n\nArtichoke extract in combination products has also been standardized. In one combination product (Limicol, Laboratoire Lescuyer), artichoke leaf extract was standardized to contain 5% to 6% caffeoylquinic acid (89451, 89452, 89454). In another combination product (ProDigest, Indena), artichoke extract was standardized to contain at least 20% caffeoylquinic acid, 5% flavonoids, and 5% cynaropicrin.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, known active phenolic constituents of artichoke, including caffeoylquinic acids and luteolin are not detected in plasma after taking artichoke leaf extract. However, metabolites of known constituents are present (52218).\nMetabolism\nFollowing oral intake of artichoke leaf extract, caffeoylquinic acid metabolites caffeic acid, its methylated derivatives ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, and hydrogenation products dihydrocaffeic acid and dihydroferulic acid, have been identified in plasma, mainly as sulfates or glucuronides. Peak plasma concentrations of caffeic acid, and its methylated derivatives ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, were reached within one hour; peak levels of dihydrocaffeic acid and dihydroferulic acid occurred after 6-7 hours (52218).\nExcretion\nFollowing oral intake of artichoke leaf extract, caffeoylquinic acid metabolites caffeic acid, its methylated derivatives ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, and hydrogenation products dihydrocaffeic acid and dihydroferulic acid, have been identified in urine, mainly as sulfates or glucuronides. Peak plasma concentrations of caffeic acid, and its methylated derivatives ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, declined over a 24-hour period following a peak at one hour (52218).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of artichoke are the leaf, stem, and root. The primary constituents include phenolic acids, primarily chlorogenic acid, cynarin, and caffeic acid; sesquiterpene lactones such as cynaropicrin and grosheimol; and flavonoids including scolymoside, cynaroside, narirutin, apigenin, ferulic acid, and luteolin (2056, 52209, 52215, 91477, 97717). Artichoke also contains the polysaccharide inulin (52219).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research shows that artichoke has antioxidant effects (104134).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn humans, artichoke extract improves endothelial dysfunction, a marker of the onset of atherosclerosis (52216, 111564). It is thought that artichoke extract may improve endothelial dysfunction by improving the vasodilatory responses of endothelial cells (52215). Artichoke also decreases carotid inter-media thickness in overweight adults, further suggesting that artichoke may protect against cardiovascular disease (111564).\nGastrointestinal effects\nArtichoke's therapeutic benefit in dyspepsia has centered around its choleretic effects, or ability to stimulate bile flow, which has been demonstrated in several studies (2056). This might also explain its use as a hangover remedy (11774). Constituents responsible for this effect are thought to be cynarin, chlorogenic acid, and scolymoside (2056). Antiemetic, spasmolytic, and carminative effects of artichoke have also been described. These effects may be responsible for the potential beneficial effects in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (2562).\nHepatic effects\nThere is conflicting evidence whether artichoke improves liver function; a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with various conditions suggests that effects on liver transaminase levels are dependent on the underlying condition. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) experienced improvements in aspartate transaminase levels, whereas patients with overweight or obesity experience the greatest improvements in alanine transaminase levels (108711, 111564).\n\nPreliminary research suggests that artichoke leaf extract might protect liver cells from damage (1421, 1422, 2056, 3269). A mixture of antioxidant polyphenols and flavonoids including caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin-7-O-glycoside (cynaroside), and luteolin might contribute to hepatoprotective activity (1421, 3269, 2056). Artichoke has also demonstrated protective activity against the hepatitis C virus in vitro, possibly due to the sesquiterpene lactones cynaropicrin and grosheimol (97717). Further, in a rat model of NAFLD, water extract of artichoke appears to exert a variety of hepatoprotective effects by improving lipid profiles, increasing hepatic antioxidant activity, reducing hepatic inflammation, and increasing the expression of genes central to lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (111562).\nLipid effects\nThe artichoke constituents cynarin and chlorogenic acid may have cholesterol-lowering effects, although studies with cynarin for hyperlipidemia have produced mixed results (1423, 1424). Artichoke might reduce cholesterol synthesis, possibly related to direct inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by the constituents cynaroside and its derivative, luteolin (1425, 2056). Artichoke extract also appears to reduce LDL oxidation in laboratory research (1426).\nRenoprotective effects\nSome animal research shows that artichoke leaf extract has renoprotective effects. In rats fed a high-fat diet, administration of artichoke leaf extract decreased kidney weight and markers of kidney function, including urea, uric acid, and creatinine. The antioxidant effects of artichoke are thought to explain these findings (104134)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral consumption of Ascophyllum nodosum extract, phlorotannins and phlorotannin metabolites are detectable in plasma (95169, 103900). Iodine levels are also increased after taking Ascophyllum nodosum powder (94997, 95102). However, the iodine from Ascophyllum nodosum is not absorbed as well as with potassium iodide supplementation (94997).\nMetabolism\nPhlorotannins from Ascophyllum nodosum are conjugated as glucuronides and/or sulfates. Most phlorotannin metabolites are detected in plasma between 6 hours and 24 hours after intake, suggesting that metabolism by gut microbes occurs in the large intestine prior to absorption (95169).\nExcretion\nIn humans, both conjugated and unconjugated phlorotannins were excreted in the urine between 8 and 24 hours after taking Ascophyllum nodosum (95169). Iodine absorbed from Ascophyllum nodosum powder is excreted in the urine (94997).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAscophyllum nodosum is high in polysaccharides such as fucoidans, the fucan ascophyllan, laminarin, mannitol, and alginate. The fucoidans and fucans are high in the carbohydrate fucose (94996, 95000). The tannins found in Ascophyllum nodosum are called phlorotannins, which are found exclusively in brown seaweed (95106). Ascophyllum nodosum also contains vitamins and minerals, such as iodine (95000). The main fatty acid in Ascophyllum nodosum is oleic acid. It also contains saturated fatty acids and omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (74274, 95107).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn laboratory research, Ascophyllum nodosum has shown anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (95147). However, preliminary clinical research in overweight and obese adults shows that taking Ascophyllum nodosum extract 100 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or C-reactive protein (103900).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research shows that Ascophyllum nodosum has antioxidant activity. However, preliminary clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking Ascophyllum nodosum extract 100 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve antioxidant status. However, it does seem to decrease oxidative DNA damage in patients with obesity, but not overweight (103900).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that Ascophyllum nodosum extract inhibits replication of multiple influenza A virus strains, primarily by interfering with early and later stages of replication including host-cell viral entry and release (116159).\nCardiovascular effects\nFucoidan polysaccharides, constituents of Ascophyllum nodosum, might act like glycosaminoglycans. Laboratory research suggests that fucoidan promotes vascularization, possibly by controlling cytokine levels (95105).\nDental effects\nThere have been reports of reduced deposits on teeth in people who eat diets containing Ascophyllum nodosum. Build-up of calculus is reduced in animal and human research when Ascophyllum nodosum is consumed (94996). The mechanism of action is not clear. It is hypothesized that some constituents of Ascophyllum nodosum might prevent the growth of calculus crystals or induce their breakdown. Constituents of interest include polysaccharides fermented to short chain fatty acids, or bioactive peptides produced during digestion. If present in the saliva, these constituents may compete for adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite in the teeth. However, this has not been shown in humans (94996).\nGlycemic effects\nIn vitro, Ascophyllum nodosum inhibits enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion (74215, 95104). Furthermore, in animal models, a combination of Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus prolongs glucose absorption and delays digestion (95104). However, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of extract from Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus (Insea2, innoVactiv Inc.) 250 mg decreases postprandial insulin concentrations by about 12%, with no effect on postprandial glucose concentrations (74215).\nImmune effects\nIn animal research, Ascophyllum nodosum has demonstrated anti-cancer effects. This is possibly due to the polysaccharide constituent, ascophyllan. Ascophyllan has exhibited immune stimulating effects in laboratory research. Ascophyllan seems to promote activity of immune cells and the production of cytokines involved in the immune response to cancer cells (95145, 95146).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research suggests that Ascophyllum nodosum has antihyperlipidemic effects. In a rat model of hyperlipidemia, a phlorotannin-rich extract of Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus reduced blood lipid levels and hepatic triglyceride levels when compared with control groups, with researchers theorizing that this seaweed extract improves lipid metabolism by modulating the activity of lipoprotein lipase (110561).\nWeight loss effects\nAscophyllum nodosum is used to induce satiety for weight loss or weight maintenance. The polyphenols in the Ascophyllum nodosum extract possibly inhibit digestive enzymes such as lipase and alpha-amylase (95103). In human research, taking a combination of Ascophyllum nodosum extract, L-carnitine, and garcinia (Lisopresol) for one week reduced hunger sensations before a test meal and led to increased satiety following a test meal, but with no reduction in energy consumption (95103). When added to bread at breakfast, Ascophyllum nodosum decreased energy intake at a meal four hours later when compared to a control bread (74216).\n\nIn a high-fat diet animal model, Ascophyllum nodosum extract reduced body fat and body weight gains (95168). However, there is no evidence that taking Ascophyllum nodosum produces weight loss in humans."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of ash are the seed/fruit (100051, 100053, 100054). Ash seeds contain secoiridoid glycosides, including nuzhenide and the dimer GI3 (100054). The main coumarins in ash include fraxin, fraxetin, esculin, esculetin, scopolin, and fraxidin glucoside (100051).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAsh seeds are traditionally used for diabetes. Clinical research shows that taking ash seed/fruit extract may reduce postprandial glycemia - expressed as area under the blood glucose curve (AUC) - in nondiabetic patients (100051, 100054). In animal research, ash seed/fruit extract inhibits fasting levels of glucose (100052). The exact mechanism of action is unclear but may relate to inhibition of the renal reabsorption of glucose and/or inhibition of PPAR-alpha (100052, 100053). Secretion of insulin does not appear to be significantly affected by ash (100051, 100054).\nHypotensive effects\nThe hypotensive effects of ash seed shown in animal research are possibly related to vasodilatory and/or diuretic effects (100052)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of ashitaba are the leaf, root, stem, and stem juice. The plant contains several chalcones, including xanthoangelols D, E, and F, and 4-hydroxyderricin. It also contains flavonoids, saponins, and coumarins, including bergaptin, xanthotoxin, angelicin, psoralen, colombianadin, archangelicin, and 8(S),9(S)-angeloyloxyl-8,9-dihydrooroselol (13245, 112327, 112328).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that the ashitaba chalcone constituent, xanthoangelol D, suppresses basal and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) inflammatory pathway. An alcoholic extract of ashitaba root also reduces serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, and interleukin-6 (13250, 112327).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, the chalcone constituents xanthoangelol and 4-hydroxyderricin exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms (13245).\nAnticancer effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that ashitaba extract inhibits the activation of certain carcinogens (100593). The chalcone constituent xanthoangelol also induces apoptosis of neuroblastoma and leukemia cell lines (14251).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that ashitaba has antioxidant effects through scavenging of free radicals (100593).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal models, an ethyl acetate extract of ashitaba stem juice does not lower blood pressure, but increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and decreases triglyceride levels (13247). The 4-hydroxyderricin constituent of ashitaba lowers blood pressure, and decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels, but does not increase HDL cholesterol levels (13249).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn vitro, the chalcone constituents of ashitaba, xanthoangelol and 4-hydroxyderricin, inhibit gastric H+, K+-ATPase, suggesting that ashitaba might have an antisecretory effect. In an animal model, xanthoangelol decreases acid secretion and reduces the formation of stress-induced ulcers (13246).\n\nA fermented ashitaba product (ashitaba jiaosu) reduces the elevated Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota associated with obesity. It also improves diversity in the gut microbiota (112328).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal model of acute cholestasis, an alcoholic extract of ashitaba root reduces hepatocellular necrosis, liver inflammation, and deposition of collagen fiber around portal veins. It also reduces oxidative stress, hepatic infiltration of macrophages, activity of the nuclear factor-kappa-beta inflammatory pathway, and serum levels of bilirubin, and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6. Bile acid production is reduced by inhibition of the activity of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a cytochrome P450 enzyme (112327).\nMetabolic effects\nAshitaba jiaosu, prepared by fermentation of ashitaba with yeast, contains increased levels of free amino acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, flavonoids, chalcones, phenolics, and protein. In mice fed a high fat diet, ashitaba jiaosu given enterally for 8 weeks reduces body weight, and serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, leptin, and glucose, when compared with controls. It is also associated with reductions in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, visceral and hepatic fat, and reduced fatty vacuoles and degeneration in liver cells. Ashitaba jiaosu promotes lipolysis by upregulation of p-AMPK and PPAR-alpha, and reduces lipid synthesis by downregulating PPAR-gamma (112328)."

However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and vomiting. However, these adverse effects do not commonly occur with typical doses.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Some case reports raise concerns about acute hepatitis, acute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, the need for liver transplantation, and death due to liver failure with ashwagandha treatment.\nDermatologic\nOrally, dermatitis has been reported in three of 42 patients in a clinical trial (19276).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case report describes a 73-year-old female who had taken an ashwagandha root extract (unspecified dose) for 2 years to treat hypothyroidism which had been previously managed with levothyroxine. The patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism after presenting with supraventricular tachycardia, chest pain, tremor, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, hair thinning, and low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Hyperthyroidism resolved after discontinuing ashwagandha (108745). Additionally, an otherwise healthy adult who was taking ashwagandha extract orally for 2 months experienced clinical and laboratory-confirmed thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis resolved 50 days after discontinuing ashwagandha, without other treatment (114111). Another case report describes a 37-year-old female who presented with moderate symptomatic hyponatremia secondary to adrenal insufficiency after chronic consumption of ashwagandha for 2 years. This subject was effectively managed with oral hydrocortisone (114790).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, large doses may cause gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and vomiting secondary to irritation of the mucous and serous membranes (3710). When taken orally, nausea and abdominal pain (19276, 110490, 113609) and gastritis and flatulence (90651) have been reported.\nless\nGenitourinary\nIn one case report, a 28-year-old male with a decrease in libido who was taking ashwagandha 5 grams daily over 10 days subsequently experienced burning, itching, and skin and mucous membrane discoloration of the penis, as well as an oval, dusky, eroded plaque (3 cm) with erythema on the glans penis and prepuce (32537).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, ashwagandha in doses of 154 mg to 20 grams daily has played a role in several case reports of cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed liver injuries. In most of these cases, other causes of liver injury were excluded, and liver failure did not occur. Symptoms included jaundice, pruritus, malaise, fatigue, lethargy, weight loss, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and distension, stool discoloration, and dark urine. Symptom onset was typically 5-180 days from first intake, although in some cases onset occurred after more than 12 months of use (102686, 107372, 110490, 110491, 111533, 111535, 112111, 113610, 114113). Laboratory findings include elevated aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) (112111, 113610, 114113). In most cases, liver enzymes normalized within 1-5 months after discontinuation of ashwagandha (102686, 107372, 110491, 111535, 112111, 114113). However, treatment with corticosteroids, lactulose, ornithine, ursodeoxycholic acid, and plasmapheresis, among other interventions, was required in one case (111533). Rarely, use of oral ashwagandha has been reported to cause hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure requiring liver transplantation, and acute-on-chronic liver failure resulting in death (110490, 113610).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, ashwagandha has been reported to cause drowsiness (110492, 113609). Headache, neck pain, and blurry vision have been reported in a 47-year-old female taking ashwagandha, cannabis, and venlafaxine. Imaging over the course of multiple years and hospital admissions indicated numerous instances of intracranial hemorrhage and multifocal stenosis of intracranial arteries, likely secondary to reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) (112113). It is unclear whether the RCVS and subsequent intracranial hemorrhages were precipitated by ashwagandha, cannabis, or venlafaxine.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAnxiety. Small clinical studies suggest that oral ashwagandha might reduce anxiety.\nA meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials in adults with anxiety and/or insomnia shows that taking ashwagandha 600-12,000 mg orally daily for 6-10 weeks moderately improves anxiety scores when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity (114787).\n\nOne small clinical study in postal workers reporting moderate or severe anxiety shows that taking ashwagandha root (Swiss Herbals) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, in combination with standard psychotherapy interventions, including dietary counseling, deep breathing exercise instruction, and a multivitamin, reduces anxiety scores when compared with standard psychotherapy interventions and placebo (19271). Additionally, two small clinical studies in adults with mild to moderate anxiety, depression, or stress show that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract standardized to contain 2.5% withanolides (Shagandha, Sabinsa Corp.) 500 mg with piperine 5 mg daily for 60-90 days reduces anxiety symptoms and perceived stress and improves sleep and quality of life when compared with placebo (113608, 113609). However, another clinical study in young adults shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root and leaf extract (NooGandha, Specnova LLC) 225 mg or 400 mg daily for 30 days does not improve anxiety, stress, and depression scores when compared with placebo (107370).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral ashwagandha may modestly improve symptoms of anxiety in patients with GAD.\nClinical practice guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) provisionally recommend ashwagandha root extract at doses of 300-600 mg, standardized to 5% withanolides, daily as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients with GAD. This recommendation is based on a review of three preliminary clinical trials with consistent results (110318). Two of these studies are described below.\n\nA small clinical trial in patients with GAD who are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) shows that taking ashwagandha 1 gram daily for 6 weeks reduces symptoms of anxiety by 48%, compared with a 27% reduction in patients taking placebo. Furthermore, by the end of treatment, 72% of patients taking ashwagandha were determined to have mild symptoms of GAD, compared with only 32% of those taking placebo (102687). Another preliminary clinical trial in patients aged 16 years and older with GAD shows that taking ashwagandha root powder granules 4 grams three times daily for 60 days moderately improves anxious mood in 58% of patients, compared with no moderate improvement in the placebo group. Mild improvement occurred in 82% of patients in the placebo group and 40% of patients in the ashwagandha group (90654). Another small clinical trial in adults with general anxiety disorder shows that taking ashwagandha, standardized to 35% withanolides, 60-120 mg orally daily for 60 days improves anxiety scores by about 60% when compared with placebo (114792).\nless\nInsomnia. Oral ashwagandha may modestly improve sleep in patients with insomnia or non-restorative sleep.\nA small meta-analysis in patients with insomnia and healthy patients shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 250-600 mg daily or a specific root and leaf extract (Shoden, Arjuna Natural) 120 mg daily for 6-12 weeks modestly improves overall sleep, as well as sleep quality, sleep latency, total sleep time, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, when compared with placebo. Effects were more pronounced in those with insomnia, with doses of at least 600 mg daily, and with treatment durations of at least 8 weeks (106784). These findings may be limited by heterogeneity of the included studies. A meta-analysis of 2 small randomized controlled trials in adults with anxiety and/or insomnia shows that taking ashwagandha 600 mg orally daily for 8-10 weeks modestly improves sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality scores, but not wake after sleep onset or total time in bed, when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this study is limited by moderate heterogeneity (114787).\n\nIn patients with non-restorative sleep, clinical research shows that taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Shoden, Arjuna Natural Private Ltd) 125 mg daily for 6 weeks increases sleep quality by 72%, compared with an improvement of 29% in patients taking placebo. Small to moderate improvements also occurred in total sleep time, sleep latency, and number of times awake (103476).\n\nAshwagandha has also been evaluated as part of a combination treatment. A very small clinical trial in adults with poor quality sleep shows that taking milk fortified with ashwagandha 250-600 mg, or ashwagandha 250 mg and tryptophan, orally daily for 90 days moderately improves sleep quality scores when compared with placebo (114791). Additional data are needed to determine if the addition of tryptophan improves results more than ashwagandha alone.\nless\nStress. Oral ashwagandha seems to help reduce stress and may also reduce stress-related weight gain.\nA meta-analysis of seven small clinical studies in healthy adults, patients with chronic stress, or patients with psychiatric conditions shows that taking ashwagandha 240-1000 mg daily for 8-12 weeks improves stress when compared with placebo (109587). Clinical studies, some of which are included in the meta-analysis mentioned above, evaluating adults with chronic stress show that taking specific ashwagandha root extracts 240 mg daily (Shoden, Arjuna Natural Ltd.), 300 mg twice daily (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed), or 500 mg daily (Shagandha, Sabinsa Corp.) with piperine 5 mg for 60 days, or a specific slow-release capsule containing ashwagandha root extract (Prolanza) 300 mg daily for 90 days reduces perceived stress and cortisol levels when compared with baseline and placebo (90652, 95617, 101816, 102682, 107371, 113608). In contrast, a moderate-sized study in adults with overweight or mild obesity with moderate-to-high levels of stress and fatigue shows that taking ashwagandha root extract (Witholytin, Verdure Sciences Inc) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces stress when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (113611).\n\nIn healthy college students, clinical research also shows that taking ashwagandha root extract 350 mg twice daily for 30 days improves qualitative perceptions of stress management, but not stress scores, when compared with placebo (109589, 109590). Other clinical research shows that taking ashwagandha root extract 500 mg twice daily may prevent stress-related weight gain when compared with placebo (95617).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging. A small clinical study suggests that oral ashwagandha may modestly improve well-being, sleep, and alertness in elderly patients.\nA small clinical trial in individuals aged 65-80 years shows that taking ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 600 mg daily for 12 weeks improves overall well-being, sleep quality, and mental alertness by small to moderate amounts when compared with placebo (102684).\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. It is unclear if topical ashwagandha is beneficial for androgenic alopecia.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate hair loss, including androgenic alopecia, shows that applying ashwagandha root extract serum (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 1-2 drops to the scalp daily for 75 days reduces hair shedding and increases hair density, growth, and thickness when compared with placebo (113613).\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if ashwagandha is beneficial for attenuating the metabolic side effects of antipsychotic agents.\nOne preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Cap Strelaxin, M/s Pharmanza Herbal Pvt. Ltd.) 400 mg three times daily for one month reduces serum triglycerides by 12% and fasting blood glucose by 15% when compared with baseline levels. Patients were taking atypical antipsychotics and had modestly elevated triglycerides and fasting blood glucose levels at baseline (90649). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if ashwagandha is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials shows that taking ashwagandha increases aerobic capacity in athletes and non-athletes based on the measurement of maximum oxygen consumption. Effective doses ranged from 500-1000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks (102683). Another meta-analysis shows that taking ashwagandha in doses of 120-1250 mg daily, as a single dose or divided twice daily, for up to 6 months seems to improve muscle strength, speed, time to exhaustion, recovery time, and cardiorespiratory fitness in athletes and non-athletes (105824). However, the validity of this analysis is reduced by the lack of a control group, the varied training levels of the subjects, and the wide range of outcomes assessed. A moderate-sized clinical trial in active adults shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 300 mg orally twice daily, in addition to resistance training, for 8 weeks improves the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO2 max) as a measure of cardiorespiratory endurance, but not muscle strength when compared with placebo (114788). More research is needed to determine whether taking ashwagandha can improve athletic performance.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn a preliminary clinical trial, children with ADHD were given a combination herbal extract formula (Nurture & Clarity), containing ashwagandha, white peony root, gotu kola, blue-green algae, bacopa, and sage, 3 mL three times daily for 4 months. Measures of attention, cognition, and impulse control improved significantly in children receiving ashwagandha when compared with placebo (19272). The dose of ashwagandha in the combination product was not reported, and the effect of ashwagandha alone in ADHD is unclear.\nless\nBack pain. Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with back pain shows that taking a specific combination product (Berelief, Monteloeder S.L.) containing ashwagandha 66%, rosemary, and sesame seed, 200-400 mg orally daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain scores and reduces the need for adjunct pain medication when compared with placebo (114793). It is unclear if this effect is due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for improving cognitive function in adults with bipolar disorder.\nClinical research shows that taking ashwagandha extract (Sensoril, Natreon, Inc.) 250 mg daily for 1 week and then 250 mg twice daily for 7 weeks, improves some, but not all, measures of cognition by a small-to-moderate amount when compared with placebo (90653).\nless\nBronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nCerebellar ataxia. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for improving balance in patients with cerebellar ataxia.\nA small, open-label study evaluating ashwagandha 500 mg three times daily in combination with Ayurvedic therapy for one month showed improvement in balance indices in subjects with cerebellar ataxia when compared with baseline (19273). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. Evidence is limited to one small clinical study in patients with breast cancer.\nIn preliminary clinical research in patients with breast cancer, taking ashwagandha powdered root extract 2 grams (Himalaya Drug Co) three times daily through six cycles of chemotherapy decreases chemotherapy-related fatigue when compared with no treatment. Fatigue scores were 16% to 52% higher in the control group when compared to the ashwagandha group (90651).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial in patients with COPD.\nA small clinical study in patients with stable COPD shows that taking ashwagandha root extract 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, along with conventional therapy, improves measures of lung function and exercise tolerance, but not quality of life, when compared with conventional therapy alone (109588).\nless\nCognitive function. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for cognitive function, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial in patients with cognitive impairment.\nA small, single-center clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Somi-On, Arjuna Natural) 250 mg daily, standardized to contain at least 2% sominone, for 60 days modestly improves some measures of immediate, general, and working memory, as well as overall cognition when compared with placebo (116648). The validity of this study is limited by the small sample size, as well as potential confounders including socioeconomic and educational backgrounds.\nless\nConstipation. Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults with constipation shows that taking a combination product containing ashwagandha root and ambrette fruit extracts 300 mg or 500 mg daily for 14 days improves bowel movement frequency and abdominal, rectal, and stool symptoms when compared with placebo (112114). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in adults with functional constipation shows that using the same combination of ashwagandha and ambrette 300 mg or 500 mg daily for 60 days moderately improves constipation symptom scores and bowel movement scores when compared with placebo (114115). It is unclear if these effects are due to ashwagandha, ambrette, or the combination.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking a specific combination product, (Artovid-20, Bioved Pharmaceuticals) containing ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, and Boswellia, 1,776 mg orally twice daily for 14 days shortens the duration of symptoms by 0.9 days when compared with placebo. Taking the combination product also modestly reduced the severity ratings of some symptoms, such as sore throat and cough, however, these improvements are unlikely to be clinically relevant (109899). Another small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking ashwagandha 500 mg and ginger 1000 mg twice daily for 15 days reduces time to recovery by around 6 days and increases the rate of clinical cure 14-fold and 2.6-fold at days 5 and 7, respectively, when compared with a control. However, taking this combination does not appear to improve the proportion of patients with a negative COVID-19 test, viral clearance, serum antibodies, chest findings, or disease progression when compared with control (112094). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Other clinical research in adults hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking a specific combination product (Coroprotect) containing ashwagandha, pomegranate, turmeric, bacopa, licorice, and other ingredients, twice daily for 10 days improved cough, breathlessness, and fatigue symptoms when compared with placebo (114114). It is unclear if any effects are due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for depression.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, or stress shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract standardized to contain 2.5% withanolides (Shagandha, Sabinsa) 500 mg with piperine 5 mg daily for 90 days reduces the severity of depressive symptoms, improves sleep and quality of life, and increases serum serotonin levels when compared with placebo (113609).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for type 2 diabetes.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, preliminary clinical research shows that ashwagandha 3 grams daily for 30 days decreases blood glucose to a degree similar to oral hypoglycemic drugs (19274). However, this study did not compare ashwagandha directly to a group taking oral hypoglycemic drugs.\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for fatigue.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity and moderate-to-high levels of fatigue and stress shows that taking ashwagandha root extract (Witholytin, Verdure Sciences Inc.) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces self-reported fatigue when compared with placebo (113611).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nHiccups. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for hiccups, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if ashwagandha is beneficial for hypercholesterolemia.\nA very small clinical study in subjects with hypercholesterolemia shows that ashwagandha 3 grams daily for 30 days decreases serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels when compared with baseline (19274). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypothyroidism. It is unclear if ashwagandha is beneficial for hypothyroidism.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks increases triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels by 42% and 20%, respectively, and reduces serum TSH levels by 17% from baseline. These changes are significant when compared with placebo (97292). However, the effects of ashwagandha on thyroid hormone levels in patients with overt hypothyroidism, or in patients taking prescription thyroid hormones, is unknown.\nless\nInfertility. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for infertility in females, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nLichen planus. It is unclear if topical ashwagandha is beneficial for oral lichen planus.\nA small clinical study in adults with oral lichen planus shows that applying ashwagandha twice daily for 4 months reduces burning, pain, and lesion size when compared to baseline. Additionally, ashwagandha reduces these outcomes similarly to topical turmeric or aloe vera (115931). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparison to placebo or standard or care.\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for male infertility.\nPreliminary clinical research in males with infertility shows that taking ashwagandha root powder for approximately 3 months modestly improves hormone levels, as well as sperm count and motility, when compared with baseline (19275, 90650). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. One study used a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66 Ashwagandha, Ixoreal Biomed) 225 mg three times daily; another study provided doses of 5 grams daily (19275, 90650).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral ashwagandha may be beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults in perimenopause shows that taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves menopausal symptom severity by 24%, compared with 11% in those receiving placebo. Quality of life and hot flashes also were improved in those taking ashwagandha (106785).\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if ashwagandha is beneficial for OCD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking ashwagandha root extract 120 mg after meals for 6 weeks, in conjunction with prescribed selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might reduce OCD symptom severity when compared with prescribed SSRIs alone. The dose was initiated at 30 mg daily and increased by 30 mg every 4 days. Although OCD scores were significantly reduced when compared with placebo, it should be noted that scores were already significantly lower in the placebo group at baseline (95618).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with osteoarthritis, taking a specific combination supplement, containing ashwagandha 450 mg, Ayurvedic zinc complex 50 mg, guggul 100 mg, and turmeric 50 mg (Articulin-F) two capsules three times daily for 3 months reduces symptoms of pain and swelling when compared with placebo. However, there were no radiological improvements (19276). It is unclear if this effect is due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nParkinson disease. Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with Parkinson disease, a small clinical study shows that taking a product containing ashwagandha 14.5 grams, cowhage 4.5 grams, Hyoscyamus reticulantus 0.75 grams, and Sida cordifolia 14.5 grams in lukewarm milk twice daily for 56 days improves symptoms like tremor, stiffness, and cramps when compared with baseline. The therapy followed 28 days of cleansing or eliminative therapy using Ayurvedic remedies (6899). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination. Cowhage contains levodopa, which may contribute to any benefit seen with this combination product.\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for improving psychological well-being in college students.\nA small clinical study in healthy college students shows that taking ashwagandha root extract 350 mg twice daily for 30 days improves perceptions of well-being, including improvements in energy, mental clarity, food cravings, and sleep quality, when compared with placebo. Qualitative analysis also suggests these students had improvements in stress management, but stress scores were not reduced when compared with placebo (109589, 109590).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral ashwagandha is beneficial for improving symptoms of RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking ashwagandha powder 5 grams twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of sidh makardhwaj (a mixture of gold, mercury, and sulfur) 100 mg with honey daily, modestly improves symptoms in about 50% of males and 60% of females with RA when compared with baseline (95620). The lack of a control group limits the validity of this finding. Additionally, the effect of ashwagandha powder alone is unclear. Another small study in adults with RA shows that taking a combination product containing ashwagandha, ginger, black pepper, and colchicum luteum orally twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve RA disease scores when compared with celecoxib 100 mg orally twice daily (114785). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nSexual dysfunction. Small clinical studies suggest that oral ashwagandha root extract may help improve sexual arousal and sexual desire in some females and males with sexual dysfunction.\nTwo, small clinical studies in adult females with sexual dysfunction show that taking ashwagandha root extract (KSM-66, Ixoreal Biomed) 300 mg twice daily with food for 8 weeks in conjunction with or without counseling increases the number of successful sexual encounters and improves orgasms, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal when compared with placebo or counseling alone (95619, 110492). Also, a small clinical study in adult males with low sexual desire shows that taking the same ashwagandha root extract 300 mg twice daily after meals for 8 weeks improves subjective sexual functioning scores, including measures of sexual arousal, sexual desire, sexual behavior, and orgasm, when compared with placebo (109586).\nless\nSmoking cessation. Oral ashwagandha has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing ashwagandha 100 mg, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, holy basil, and turmeric (Smotect, Smotect India) daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked daily and levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity when compared with placebo (112115). It is unclear if these effects are due to ashwagandha, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nTuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nVitiligo. Although there has been interest in using oral ashwagandha for vitiligo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using topical ashwagandha for healing of skin ulcers and skin sores, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ashwagandha for this condition.\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if topical ashwagandha is beneficial in individuals with wrinkled skin.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with photoaged skin shows that applying ashwagandha root extract 8% lotion daily for 60 days improves physician-rated scores for skin wrinkles, hydration, brightness, tone, and pigmentation and improves other measures of skin elasticity and hydration when compared with placebo. However, changes in melanin content did not differ between treatment groups (111538).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate ashwagandha for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "DIGOXIN SERUM ASSAY\nTaking ashwagandha might result in falsely elevated digoxin levels in some serum assays. Ashwagandha contains withaferin A, which has a similar structure to digoxin (14863, 16417). Ashwagandha can falsely elevate digoxin levels when using fluorescence polarization immunoassays (FPIA), microparticle enzyme immunoassays (MEIA) or the Abbott Digoxin III assay (14863, 16417). The Beckman assay for digoxin seems to be only minimally affected (14863). The Roche Tina-Quant turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay is only affected by very high ashwagandha levels, equivalent to plasma levels after an overdose (16417).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with ashwagandha.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral intake of ashwagandha 400-500 mg in healthy adults, ashwagandha constituents withanoside IV, withanolide A, withaferin A, and 12-deoxy-withastramonolide are quickly absorbed and reach peak plasma concentrations within 0.9-1.6 hours (113612, 116647). Peak concentrations of these constituents, following intake of ashwagandha 500 mg, range from 0.6 to 5.5 ng/mL and are quantifiable in plasma for up to 12 hours (113612). After a single 400 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of constituents ranged from 0.4 to 4.7 ng/mL in males and 0.6 to 3.2 ng/mL in females (116647).\nMetabolism\nThe concentration of withanolides is greater than that of withanosides in plasma. Gut glucosidase may hydrolyze withanosides, resulting in the bioactive constituent sominone 2 to 12 hours after oral administration of ashwagandha 500 mg (113612). After a single 400 mg dose of ashwagandha in healthy adults, half-lives of constituents ranged from 2.5-5 hours in males and 1.6-4.3 hours in females (116647).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of ashwagandha are the root and berry. Ashwagandha contains several active constituents including alkaloids (isopelletierine, anaferine), steroidal lactones (withanolides, withaferins), and saponins (4116, 11301). It also contains salvigenin, withaperuvin 1, eucommiol, vicosalactone B, anamides D and E, and asomidienone (108744). Ashwagandha does not contain nicotine as some researchers have reported (3710). Some of the withanolides are structurally similar to ginsenosides from ginseng (14863). Withaferin A has a similar structure to digoxin, and can be bound and neutralized by digoxin immune fab (Digibind) (14863).\n\nAshwagandha does not seem to have any effect on the laboratory monitoring of acetaminophen, salicylates, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, valproic acid, procainamide (including N-acetyl procainamide), theophylline, gentamicin, or tobramycin (14863).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal model research suggests that ashwagandha has a variety of pharmacological effects including analgesic effects (3710).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, ashwagandha had anti-inflammatory effects in the bladder (3711).\nAnti-stress effects\nSome researchers think ashwagandha has a so-called \"anti-stressor\" effect (4113). Preliminary research suggests ashwagandha suppresses stress-induced increases of dopamine receptors in the corpus striatum of the brain (3710). It also appears to reduce stress-induced increases of plasma corticosterone, blood urea nitrogen, and blood lactic acid (11301). Preliminary clinical research in adults with general anxiety disorder shows that taking ashwagandha, standardized to 35% withanolides, 60-120 mg orally daily for 60 days improves cortisol levels when compared with placebo (114792). Other preliminary research in healthy adults shows that taking liposomal ashwagandha 225 mg orally daily modestly improves fatigue scores, but not total mood scores when compared with placebo (114786).\nAnticancer effects\nAshwagandha is of interest for the treatment of cancer. In laboratory research, the withanolides and ashwagandha extract had cytotoxic effects in cancer cells and other laboratory models (32509, 32517, 32518, 32538, 32548, 32551, 32552).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nAshwagandha might have anticonvulsant activity, by binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (3710).\nAntidepressant effects\nHuman research shows that ashwagandha increases serum serotonin levels and morning salivary cortisol levels, suggesting that the antidepressive and anxiolytic effects are related to the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and adrenal (HPA) axis (113608, 113609).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAshwagandha is of interest for diabetes. In humans and in animal diabetic models, ashwagandha extract reduces blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). In vitro, ashwagandha extract increases the uptake of glucose into adipocytes and muscle cells. Possible active constituents include withaferin A and withanolide A. In addition, three withanolides inhibited alpha-glucosidase in vitro (102685).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal model research suggests that ashwagandha has a variety of pharmacological effects including antioxidant effects (4116, 11301, 32558, 102685).\nAntipyretic effects\nAnimal model research suggests that ashwagandha has a variety of pharmacological effects including analgesic and antipyretic effects (3710).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAshwagandha seems to have anxiolytic effects in laboratory research (32506), possibly by acting as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetic agent (3710). Animal studies have demonstrated that ashwagandha can enhance serotonergic transmission through modulation of the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors (95618).\nBlood pressure effects\nIn animal experiments, ashwagandha decreased blood pressure (32560).\nImmunologic effects\nAshwagandha and its constituents seem to have immunomodulatory effects. The withanolides and sitoindosides seem to cause a mobilization of macrophages, phagocytosis, and lysosomal enzymes (11301). In healthy adults, an ethanolic extract of ashwagandha root and leaf has been shown to increase production of immunoglobulins, interferon-gamma, interleukin-4, and T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells when compared with baseline (106786). Animal research also suggests ashwagandha might reduce cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and leukopenia (3711, 4114, 32550). Ashwagandha also seems to increase bone marrow cell and white blood cell count in radiation-treated animals (3711). It remains unclear, however, what net effect whole ashwagandha preparations have on the immune system (3710, 3711).\nLiver enzyme effects\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes show that the water, ethanol, methanol, and ethyl acetate extracts of ashwagandha root may induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzymes, although any clinical significance is unclear. The ethanol and methanol extracts may also inhibit CYP2B6 (108744).\nMemory effects\nIn animal and human research, ashwagandha or its constituents improved memory function (32563, 90653). Mechanisms of action may involve the restoration of pre- and post-synapses in cortical neuron axons and dendrites, increased axonal density, or increased peripheral nervous system myelin (32526). Also, the withanolides have shown cholinesterase inhibitory potential in laboratory research (32521, 32522). Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking liposomal ashwagandha 225 mg orally daily modestly improves performance on some, but not all, memory function tests when compared with placebo (114786).\nNeuroprotective effects\nAshwagandha is thought to have neuroprotective and adaptogenic effects. In an animal model of alcohol addiction, ashwagandha reduces alcohol intake and withdrawal anxiety. The mechanism of action may be related to increased serotonin or gamma-aminobutyric acid levels but not alterations in cortico hippocampal dopamine (112629).\nReproductive effects\nIn clinical research, ashwagandha seems to improve sperm count and motility in adult males. These effects seem to be related to improved levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (19275). Preliminary clinical research in adults with general anxiety disorder shows that taking ashwagandha, standardized to 35% withanolides, 60-120 mg orally daily for 60 days improves testosterone levels when compared with placebo (114792).\nRespiratory effects\nAshwagandha seems to stimulate respiratory function (3710).\nSedative effects\nCentral nervous system depressant properties have been reported in animal studies (11301).\nSmooth muscle effects\nAshwagandha seems to cause smooth muscle relaxation (3710).\nThyroid effects\nAshwagandha seems to stimulate thyroid synthesis and/or secretion (3710). In clinical and animal research, ashwagandha has been reported to stimulate thyroid function, increasing serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations and reducing serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (19281, 19282, 97292)."

These organic components are thought to be responsible for the distinctive odor in the urine, produced in some, but not all, individuals (32581, 94942).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of asparagus are the shoots or \"spears,\" rhizome, root, and juice. Asparagus seeds are also used medicinally. Asparagus is a good dietary source of fiber, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin B6 (15187, 15559, 15560). It also contains several minerals, including copper, iron, zinc, manganese, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. The mineral content is higher in green asparagus than in other varieties, and is highest in the tips of the spears (15565). Constituents found in asparagus roots and shoots include flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside and isoquercitrin), hydroxycinnamic acids, oligosaccharides, amino acids, carotenoids, sulfur compounds, steroidal saponins (asparagosides and aspartic saponin 1), sterols, sarsasapogenins M and N, acids (aspartic acid and esters of butyric acid), and fructans (asparagose and asparagosine) (18, 15187, 15558, 15559, 15560, 94939).\nAllergenic effects\nAllergens present in asparagus have not been fully identified, but lipid transfer proteins may be responsible for some severe, systemic allergic reactions (15562). Contact dermatitis may be caused by 1,2,3-trithiane-5-carboxylic acid, which is present in the highest quantities in young asparagus shoots, which appear to be the most allergenic (15564).\nAnti-allergy effects\nAsparagus extracts, including an acetone fraction containing glycolipids, and a methanol fraction containing phospholipids, inhibit release of beta-hexosaminidase from cells in vitro, which is a marker for inhibition of both histamine release and degranulation of granulocytes. These asparagus extracts also alleviate atopic dermatitis in a mouse model, and reduce ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin E levels in mice after challenge with an ovalbumin allergen (106412).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that asparagus extracts have antimutagenic and antitumor properties (15558, 15559). In vitro, asparagus saponins have shown cytocidal effects in human leukemia cells (32585, 32591).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro studies show that asparagus extracts have anti-inflammatory properties (15558, 15559). Several asparagus constituents inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (15187).\nAnti-viral effects\nIn vitro studies show that asparagus extracts have antiviral properties (15558, 15559).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro studies show that asparagus extracts have antibacterial properties (15558, 15559).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro studies show that asparagus extracts have antioxidant properties (15558, 15559, 32576). The antioxidant activity of asparagus is related to the total phenol content, which can vary with the variety of asparagus, growing conditions, and method of preparation (15559). Boiling asparagus reduces phenol content (15563). Asparagus juice is prepared from discarded asparagus spears and pectolytic enzymes which can contain impurities. These impurities might decrease the antioxidant content of the juice (15560).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nA study in mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that consuming asparagus extract 400-800 mg/kg daily for 7 weeks attenuates increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides but doesn't impact high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with mice not given asparagus extract (110738).\nCytotoxicity effects\nThe saponin constituents of asparagus can irritate mucous membranes and can be cytotoxic (3901).\nDiuretic effects\nAnimal studies show that asparagus extracts have diuretic properties (15558, 15559). Asparagus root contains furostanol-type and spirostanol-type steroidal saponins which are thought to act as diuretics (94940).\nHepatic effects\nA study in mice fed a usual diet suggests that drinking water supplemented with asparagus juice for 60 days reduces steatosis and inflammation when compared with mice who drank usual tap water (110737).\nHypotensive effects\nAnimal studies show that asparagus extracts have hypotensive properties (15558, 15559). However, it is not known if asparagus has hypotensive effects in humans (94939, 94940).\nImmunostimulatory effects\nIn vitro and animal studies show that asparagus extracts have immunostimulatory properties (15558, 15559).\nWeight effects\nA study in mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that consuming asparagus extract 400-800 mg/kg daily for 7 weeks attenuates weight gain when compared with mice not given asparagus extract (110738)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAmino acids, such as aspartic acid, are transported into the gut mucosal cells and then the portal blood by a carrier system. Aspartic acid is released into the systemic blood if not used by the liver (94500). Supplementary intake of D-aspartic acid has been shown to increase plasma levels (94497).\nMetabolism\nL-Aspartic acid is used by the body in the synthesis of other amino acids such as lysine, threonine, and methionine (94500). In the body, aspartic acid is a metabolite in the urea cycle and is also produced by the transamination of oxaloacetic acid, which comes from glucose breakdown (32608, 94500). Additionally, the amino acid asparagine is quickly converted to aspartic acid in the gastrointestinal tract (94500).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nL-Aspartic acid is a nonessential amino acid and a building block in proteins (5141). D-aspartic acid is an amino acid that functions in the nervous and reproductive systems (94498).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), circulating L-aspartic acid levels are lower than in non-diabetic animals. Giving L-aspartic acid supplements to the mice with DKD increases circulating levels, reduces albuminuria, reduces markers of oxidative stress, and improves function of the glomerular endothelial surface layer (104106).\nAthletic performance effects\nSome researchers theorize that an aspartate magnesium and potassium salt improves athletic ability (5133). The purported athletic performance effects of aspartic acid salts may be explained by a reduction in ammonia levels during exercise or via the sparing of muscle glycogen. However, these effects are not commonly found in animal or human studies (32608).\nHormonal effects\nD-aspartic acid is thought to increase testosterone levels, which could theoretically improve muscle mass and exercise performance. Although evidence in animal models supports this theory, results in humans are inconsistent (94497, 94499). The effect of D-aspartic acid seems to be dependent on the dose and duration of therapy, as well as the characteristics of the recipient. Preliminary clinical research shows that while taking D-aspartic acid 3 grams daily increases testosterone levels in untrained men, it has no effect on testosterone in resistance-trained men. Taking 6 grams daily for 2 weeks slightly decreases testosterone levels in resistance-trained men. However, taking 6 grams of D-aspartic acid daily for longer than 3 months does not produce sustained effects on testosterone levels (97576).\nMemory effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a combination of aspartic acid 0.5 grams and other amino acids orally daily for 4 weeks improves cognitive function scores, but not fatigue scores, when compared with placebo (111249).\nMineral absorption effects\nThe aspartate salt of various minerals, such as copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, or zinc, is theorized to improve oral absorption (5133). There is some evidence to suggest that magnesium aspartate is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide in humans (13383).\nWeight effects\nSome researchers believe that changes in certain amino acids may affect weight loss. A post-hoc analysis of clinical research in adults undergoing intermittent fasting for 12 weeks shows that a diet lower in aspartic acid is associated with lower fasting blood glucose, but not a change in body mass index (112186)."

Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in healthy adults over 40 years of age with mild forgetfulness shows that taking a specific combination supplement (BGG Japan Co.) containing astaxanthin 9 mg and tocotrienols 50 mg daily for 12 weeks might improve composite and verbal memory when compared with placebo (105099). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with non-advanced AMD shows that a specific combination product (Azyr, Sifi S.p.A.) containing astaxanthin 4 mg, lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, and copper, taken daily for 12 months, improves selective dysfunction in the central retina, but does not improve dysfunction in the peripheral retinal areas, when compared with baseline (19196). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAging skin. Small studies suggest that oral and topical astaxanthin may be beneficial in aging skin; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding its effects on wrinkles.\nSmall studies in middle-aged adults show that taking astaxanthin (Astavita Astaxanthin, Astavita; AstaReal Oil 50F, Fuji Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) 2-3 mg orally twice daily for 6-8 weeks improves elasticity, fine lines, wrinkles, and skin moisture when compared with placebo (19561, 91734). However, a meta-analysis of small clinical studies in healthy adults shows that taking oral astaxanthin 2-12 mg daily for 4-16 weeks modestly improves moisture content and skin elasticity, but has no effect on wrinkle depth, when compared with placebo (107961). The validity of this meta-analysis is limited due to the population heterogeneity and variety of astaxanthin formulations utilized.\n\nIn addition to oral astaxanthin, one study also used topical astaxanthin 0.094% (AstaTROL-Hp, Fuij Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) 1 mL applied twice daily (91734). A systematic review of two very small, nonblinded studies in healthy adults suggests that topical application, either in combination with oral astaxanthin or alone, might have anti-aging skin effects when used for 2-3 weeks (107961).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this condition.\nAthletic performance. Small studies suggest that oral astaxanthin may improve some aspects of athletic performance.\nTwo small studies in trained cyclists show that taking astaxanthin (Fuji Health Science, Inc. or AstaReal) 4-12 mg daily for 1 or 4 weeks decreases the time to complete a 20-40 km cycling trial by about 50-100 seconds when compared with placebo (91735, 105096). However, a larger study in trained cyclists shows that taking astaxanthin (BioReal) 20 mg, vitamin C 300 mg, and vitamin E 50 mg daily for 4 weeks does not decrease time needed to complete a predetermined amount of cycling work (a timed trial) when compared with placebo (91738). Reasons for the discrepancies are not clear but may relate to the fitness level of the athletes in the studies or the differences in timed trial protocols used in the studies.\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of astaxanthin 4 mg, lutein, beta-carotene, and vitamin E (BioAstin, Cyanotech) orally 3 times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce the rate or duration of pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome when compared with placebo (19164).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin is beneficial for diabetes.\nA small clinical trial in adults with diabetes shows that taking astaxanthin (Nature Vision) 8 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce levels of cholesterol or fasting blood glucose or reduce diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, there were some modest beneficial effects on visceral fat, triglyceride level, and systolic blood pressure (109778).\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin is beneficial for dry eye syndrome.\nA clinical study in adults and elderly patients with mild to moderate dry eye syndrome shows that taking oral astaxanthin 6 mg twice daily for 30 days improves symptom severity, tear break-up time, fluorescein break-up time, and meibomian gland dysfunction, but not visual acuity or intraocular pressure, when compared with baseline (107962). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin improves symptoms of dyspepsia.\nOne clinical study in adults with functional dyspepsia with or without Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking astaxanthin (AstaCarox, AstaReal AB) 16 mg or 40 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce indigestion, pain, or H. pylori counts when compared with placebo. However, astaxanthin 40 mg daily may reduce reflux in H. pylori-positive patients (19165).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Small clinical studies in trained athletes suggest that oral astaxanthin may not improve markers of muscle damage from exercise.\nA small study in professional male soccer players shows that taking astaxanthin 4 mg daily for 90 days does not seem to reduce exercised-induced biomarkers of muscle damage, such as creatinine kinase, when compared with placebo (91739). Taking a combination of astaxanthin 4 mg and lutein 480 mg (BioAstin, Cyanotech) daily for 3 weeks also did not reduce creatinine kinase levels after exercise in trained athletes when compared with placebo (safflower oil) (19199).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in resistance trained athletes shows that taking a combination of astaxanthin 4 mg and lutein 480 mg (BioAstin, Cyanotech) daily for 3 weeks does not reduce muscle soreness or improve muscle performance 96 hours after exercise when compared with placebo (safflower oil) (19199).\nless\nFatigue. Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy patients shows that taking a specific combination product (ASTOTS, Fujifilm Co.) containing astaxanthin 6 mg and sesamin 10 mg after breakfast daily for 4 weeks does not improve overall fatigue after completion of mental and physical tasks when compared with placebo (98769).\nless\nHeart failure. Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) shows that taking a specific supplement containing astaxanthin 12 mg, tocotrienol 40 mg, and L-ascorbic acid 2-glucoside 30 mg (AstaReal ACT, AstaReal Co., Ltd.) daily for 3 months may increase LVEF from 34% to 38% and modestly increase exercise tolerance as measured by the six-minute walk test when compared with baseline (105097). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, this study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral astaxanthin is not beneficial for reducing cholesterol levels.\nOne small clinical study in adults with mild hyperlipidemia shows that taking astaxanthin (AstaReal Astaxanthin, Fuji Chemical Industry) 12 mg or 18 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels, while taking 6 mg or 12 mg daily increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. However, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were not affected (19167). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies mostly in adults without hyperlipidemia have also been conducted. One shows that taking astaxanthin 4-18 mg daily for up to 12 weeks does not reduce total or LDL cholesterol levels, but may increase HDL cholesterol levels, when compared with control (105100). A more recent analysis shows that taking astaxanthin 4-20 mg daily for up to 6 months has no beneficial effects on blood lipid levels and might actually increase levels of LDL cholesterol (109776).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin reduces blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials shows that taking astaxanthin does not have a clinically beneficial effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure (109776). However, none of the trials were conducted in patients with hypertension.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral astaxanthin is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults and adults with prediabetes shows that taking oral astaxanthin 12 mg daily for 12 weeks improves glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose levels were also improved when compared with baseline, but no statistical comparison to the placebo group was conducted (107965). The validity of this study is limited due to unclear reporting.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin improves reproductive outcomes in patients with infertility due to endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nA small clinical study in adults with infertility secondary to moderate or severe endometriosis undergoing assisted reproductive therapy in Iran shows that taking astaxanthin (AstaReal, AstaReal Co.) 6 mg daily for 12 weeks improves the numbers of oocytes retrieved, mature oocytes, and high-quality embryos but not the quantity of immature oocytes, fertilization rate, number of transferred embryos, or clinical pregnancy rate when compared with placebo (112434). Similarly, a small clinical study also conducted in Iran in patients with infertility due to PCOS undergoing assisted reproductive therapy shows that taking astaxanthin (Algalife Pure astaxanthin) 8 mg daily for 40 days prior to egg retrieval modestly improves the high-quality embryo rate, but not the total number of embryos or the clinical pregnancy rate, when compared with placebo (109775).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin improves male infertility.\nA small low-quality clinical study in males with infertility who are participating in intra-uterine insemination shows that taking astaxanthin (AstaCarox, AstaReal AB) 16 mg daily for 3 months does not seem to increase sperm count and quality, but might result in a higher total pregnancy rate of 23% compared with a 3.6% rate in the placebo group (19197). The validity of this finding is limited by poor study methodology and differences between treatment groups. Another small clinical study in males with infertility and oligospermia shows that taking astaxanthin (Astasan, Sensilab) 16 mg daily does not increase sperm concentration or sperm motility when compared with placebo (105098).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this purpose.\nMetabolic syndrome.

Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for NAFLD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this condition.\nObesity. Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for weight loss, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this purpose.\nOsteoarthritis. Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild knee or hip osteoarthritis shows that taking a combination product containing astaxanthin 2 mg, krill oil, and hyaluronic acid daily for 12 weeks (FlexPro MD, Valensa) reduces joint pain and stiffness and improves objective and subjective measures of joint function but does not improve overall physical function when compared with placebo (112432). It is unclear if these effects are due to astaxanthin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this condition.\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin improves physical performance in older adults.\nA small clinical trial in healthy nursing home residents shows that taking astaxanthin (AstaReal) 12 mg twice daily for 16 weeks, in combination with vitamin E 40 mg and vitamin C 30 mg daily, increases the 6-minute walking distance by about 38 meters, a significant increase when compared with placebo containing vitamin E and vitamin C. However, there was no effect on muscle strength (109777). Another small clinical trial in healthy, older adults (aged 65-85 years) undergoing exercise endurance testing shows that a specific combination product (AstaReal; Fuji Health Science, Inc) containing astaxanthin 12 mg, tocotrienol 10 mg, and zinc 6 mg, taken as 2 capsules daily for 12 weeks, reduces the respiratory exchange ratio, but does not improve leg muscle endurance or perceived exertion, when compared with placebo. In a subgroup analysis of males, but not females, those taking astaxanthin had a greater total exercise efficiency when compared with placebo (107963).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral astaxanthin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with RA shows that taking a supplement containing astaxanthin 4 mg, lutein 40 mcg, vitamin A 65 IU, vitamin E 50 IU, and safflower oil 460 mg (BioAstin, Cyanotech) three times daily for 8 weeks reduces pain and improves satisfaction by approximately 40% when compared with placebo (94125).\nless\nStroke. Although there is interest in using oral astaxanthin for recovery from stroke, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astaxanthin for this purpose.\nSunburn. It is unclear if oral astaxanthin might help to prevent sunburn.\nA very small clinical study in Japanese adults shows that taking astaxanthin (Astots, Fujifilm Corporation) 4 mg daily for 9 weeks might increase skin tolerance to ultraviolet (UV) light when compared with placebo (96884). It is unclear if this translates to a lower risk of sunburn.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate astaxanthin for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOrally, astaxanthin is absorbed in the intestines (32658). However, because astaxanthin is a highly lipophilic compound, it has low bioavailability (32644). Human absorption of astaxanthin ranges from 6% to 34% after 4 hours (107961). The bioavailability may be increased when astaxanthin is encapsulated in a lipid-based formation (32622, 32688). Also, the absorption of astaxanthin may be increased when taken after a meal (32682, 107961).\nDistribution\nAnimal research shows that, when taken orally, astaxanthin is largely distributed to muscle and heart tissue (32722). Astaxanthin can also cross the blood-brain barrier, as well as accumulate in the dermis and epidermis (96884).\nExcretion\nPreliminary clinical research shows that the elimination half-life of astaxanthin, taken orally at a dose of 40 mg, is about 16 hours, with a monophasic curve (32622). Other preliminary clinical research suggests that the elimination half-life of astaxanthin, taken orally at a dose of 100 mg, is about 52 hours (32632).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAstaxanthin is a reddish carotenoid pigment found in the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Salmon, trout, red sea bream, shrimp, lobster, fish eggs, and many bird species also contain substantial amounts of astaxanthin (4326, 4332). It is structurally similar to beta-carotene (8467). The concentration of astaxanthin is 1% to 5% in microalgae. A 4-ounce portion of farmed Atlantic salmon contains about 0.5 to 1.1 mg of astaxanthin; 4 ounces of sockeye salmon contains about 4.5 mg (8467).\n5-Alpha-reductase inhibitory activity\nIn vitro, astaxanthin 300 mcg/mL inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, suggesting 5-alpha-reductase inhibitory effects (32638).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that astaxanthin suppresses T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatic subjects. The effect was comparable to common antihistamines cetirizine and azelastine in vitro (32626). In theory, this suggests that astaxanthin may have anti-asthmatic effects.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory and clinical research shows that astaxanthin has anti-inflammatory effects (32686, 112434). Cell culture research shows that the anti-inflammatory effects of astaxanthin are attributable to its ability to inhibit the activation of macrophages by suppressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, and suppressing the upregulation of scavenger receptors (32683). A meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that taking astaxanthin reduces levels of interleukin-6 in patients with type 2 diabetes (107960). However, a clinical study in adults with endometriosis shows that taking astaxanthin decreases serum levels of interleukin-1-beta but not interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha when compared with placebo (112434).\nAnticancer effects\nCell culture research shows that algal extract rich in astaxanthin inhibits the growth and promotes apoptosis of colon cancer cells (32678). Other cell culture research shows that astaxanthin inhibits the proliferation and decreases the viability of leukemia cells (32704). Astaxanthin seems to suppress the growth of tumor cells by increasing concentrations of gamma-interferon and increasing the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It appears that astaxanthin needs to be part of the diet prior to tumor development to inhibit tumor growth (8453).\n\nAdditional animal research suggests astaxanthin might protect against mammary cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, and oral cancer (4337, 4338, 4339, 4340).\nAntioxidant effects\nAstaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant that is structurally similar to beta-carotene (8467). It contains the highest relative antioxidant activity when compared with alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene (10634). Cell culture research shows that astaxanthin inhibits glycated protein/iron chelate-induced cytotoxicity by reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (32680).\n\nClinical research is conflicting on whether astaxanthin reduces markers of oxidative stress and seems to depend on the underlying disease state. Some research shows that taking astaxanthin 4-20 mg daily for 1 to 12 months reduces blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) , a marker of oxidative stress (98768, 107960). Interestingly, greater reductions in MDA are observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, and with doses of 11-13 mg daily. Additionally, astaxanthin may reduce levels of superoxide dismutase in overweight patients, but not in healthy individuals, when compared with placebo (107960). In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), astaxanthin improved the total antioxidant status but did not affect MDA, catalase, or superoxide dismutase (109775). However, in patients with endometriosis, astaxanthin reduces serum levels of MDA and superoxide dismutase but does not improve total antioxidant status or affect catalase when compared with placebo. Additionally, astaxanthin does not reduce any markers of oxidative stress in follicular fluid (112434). Further research is needed to determine the effect of astaxanthin on specific antioxidant levels.\n\nSome preliminary research suggests that the antioxidant effects of astaxanthin can protect against neurodegenerative diseases. Cell culture and animal research shows that astaxanthin prevents beta-amyloid-induced oxidative damage to red blood cells and dopaminergic cells. Theoretically this may help prevent the progression of Alzheimer disease and other dementias (32695, 32702). Also, preliminary research in humans shows that astaxanthin can help reduce the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides in erythrocytes. Abnormal accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides is associated with dementia (32700). Also, oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Cell culture and animal research shows that astaxanthin reduces oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that it may protect against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson disease (32669, 32673, 32676, 32697). Animal research also shows that the antioxidant effects of astaxanthin helps protect against ischemia-induced injury to brain tissue (32674).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research suggests that astaxanthin may reduce blood pressure by normalizing the sensitivity of the adrenoceptor sympathetic pathway, particularly alpha-adrenoceptors, and helping restore vascular tone (32644). In vitro and ex vivo research shows that astaxanthin inhibits low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, which could help prevent atherosclerosis (32612). Animal research shows that intravenous or oral astaxanthin protects the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury when administered prior to the induction of an ischemic event (32703).\nDermatologic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that astaxanthin may be able to prevent oxidative damage to fibroblasts and epithelial cells caused by ultraviolet (UVA) light (8490, 32616, 32633, 32648, 91734). This may help protect the skin from photodamage. In vitro research shows that astaxanthin can suppress the oxidative polymerization in melanocytes and inflammation in the epidermis, which may reduce the formation of melanin that contributes to age spots (91734). In vitro research also shows that astaxanthin reduces the peroxidation of sebum oil, which may reduce rough skin (91734). Preliminary clinical research also suggests that astaxanthin might reverse certain age-related skin changes. In one study in healthy adults, taking astaxanthin 4 mg daily for 4 weeks reduced microbial presence and skin cell desquamation of residual skin surface components (98768).\nErgogenic effects\nAnimal studies have shown that astaxanthin may improve endurance and increase muscle strength (32649, 32722). Animal models suggest that astaxanthin may improve exercise performance by increasing the utilization of fatty acids as an energy source (32649, 91738). However, the effect of astaxanthin on exercise performance in humans is conflicting (91735, 91738).\nGastroprotective effects\nPreliminary data that suggests that astaxanthin might have gastroprotective effects against Helicobacter pylori, possibly by inhibiting inflammation and acting as an antioxidant (4341). However, astaxanthin does not appear to have antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori in clinical research (19165, 19166).\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary data suggest astaxanthin may decrease oxidative liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride. It seems to decrease oxidative consumption of glutathione (GSH) and increase hepatoprotective antioxidant activity (8454). Animal studies suggest that astaxanthin reduces lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits lipid peroxidation. It also inhibits expression of the inflammatory mediator, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1 by nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB), and improves insulin signaling in hepatocytes (95919, 95920). In a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), astaxanthin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, attenuates insulin resistance, decreases lipid accumulation and peroxidation, and reduces fibrosis (95920). One preliminary case report involving a 58-year-old female with Werner Syndrome, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who was taking atorvastatin shows that taking astaxanthin 12 mg orally daily for 6 months improves the appearance of fatty liver on computed tomography scan and returns mildly elevated liver function tests to the normal range. However, neither markers of oxidative stress nor markers of inflammation were improved in this patient; therefore, the mechanism by which astaxanthin improves fatty liver disease in humans is not clear (95918).\nImmunostimulant effects\nPreliminary research suggests that astaxanthin might stimulate immunity (4335, 4336). It appears to enhance Th1 and Th2 cells for humoral (i.e., antibody-mediated) immune responses (4335, 32708). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that astaxanthin can enhance both humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response (32686).\nPhotoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that astaxanthin may be able to prevent oxidative damage to fibroblasts and epithelial cells caused by ultraviolet (UVA) light (8490, 32616, 32633, 32648, 91734). This may help protect the skin and eyes from photodamage.\nRenal protective effects\nAnimal research shows that astaxanthin reduces glomerular hypertrophy and tubular dilatation in diabetic rats (94126). Cell culture research shows that astaxanthin may protect against diabetes-induced kidney damage by suppressing hyperglycemia-induced production of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria of human mesangial cells. This suggests that astaxanthin may protect against diabetic nephropathy (32660).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research shows that astaxanthin reduces fat accumulation and inhibits increases in body weight and adipose tissue weight in obese mice fed a high-fat diet. Astaxanthin may protect against weight gain by stimulating an increase in fatty acid utilization (32654)."

It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for allergic rhinitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific astragalus root extract standardized to contain 40% polysaccharides (Lectranal, Milsing d.o.o.) 160 mg orally twice daily for 3-6 weeks improves symptoms such as rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching when compared with placebo in adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis (17355).\nless\nAmenorrhea. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking a liquid decoction containing astragalus 30 grams, dong quai 30 grams, zizyphus 10 fruits, horny goat weed 15 grams, dodder 30 grams, and three slices of ginger, daily in two divided doses for 3 months, can increase menstrual frequency when compared to baseline in patients with amenorrhea (33050). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to astragalus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAngina. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for angina.\nA preliminary clinical trial shows that taking astragalus 20 grams orally three times daily for 2 weeks can improve cardiac output, but not diastolic function, when compared to baseline in patients with angina (33063). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for preventing cardiotoxicity due to anthracyclines. Oral astragalus has not been evaluated for this use.\nA large unblinded clinical study in patients with breast cancer or lymphoma receiving a chemotherapy regimen containing epirubicin shows that intravenous use of astragalus 500 mg daily for 14 days during 2 courses of chemotherapy modestly attenuates the decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and reduces the occurrence of cardiotoxicity when compared with standard care (110479). However, this study was conducted in China, which limits the generalizability of its results.\nless\nAplastic anemia. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for aplastic anemia. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral astragalus for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients 15 years and older with chronic aplastic anemia shows that giving intravenous astragalus in combination with stanozolol 2 mg three times daily produces greater improvements in symptoms and blood cell counts than stanozolol alone. Astragalus was given as 80-120 grams daily for repeated 15-day courses at 7-10 day intervals for at least 4 months (32840).\nless\nAsthma. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with mild asthma shows that taking a combination of astragalus, cordyceps, Radix stemonae (Bai Bu), bulbus fritillariae cirrhosae, and Baikal skullcap orally for 6 months does not improve asthma symptoms, measures of lung function, or total steroid use when compared with placebo (32935).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. Although there has been interest in using oral astragalus for beta-thalassemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this condition.\nBreast cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral astragalus for breast cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this condition.\nCervical cancer. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials in adults with cervical cancer who are receiving chemotherapy shows that the use of Chinese herbal medicines containing astragalus increases tumor response (complete and partial responses) and Karnofsky performance score and reduces chemotherapy-associated adverse effects when compared with chemotherapy alone (107479). However, most studies included in the meta-analysis were low-quality, and all studies were conducted in China. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, it is unclear if any effects are due to astragalus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced anemia. Oral or intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer shows that oral or intravenous use of traditional Chinese medicine therapies containing astragalus and other ingredients along with conventional chemotherapy reduces the risk of anemia by 51% when compared with chemotherapy alone (102099). It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral or intravenous astragalus is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that intravenous infusion of astragalus 40 grams in 250 mL of solution, given daily for 21 days during each of four courses of chemotherapy, reduces diarrhea by 59% when compared to chemotherapy alone (32747). Additionally, a meta-analysis of low-quality clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer shows that oral or intravenous use of traditional Chinese medicine therapies containing astragalus and other ingredients along with conventional chemotherapy reduces the risk of diarrhea by 45% when compared with chemotherapy alone (102099).

It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Early research suggests that intravenous astragalus seems to reduce nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy use. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for CINV.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer shows that intravenous infusion of astragalus along with platinum-based chemotherapy reduces the risk of vomiting by 38% when compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone (100698). Another preliminary clinical study shows that intravenous infusion of astragalus 40 grams in 250 mL of solution, given daily for 21 days during each of four courses of chemotherapy, reduces nausea by 36% and vomiting by 50% when compared with chemotherapy alone (32747). Higher quality studies are needed to confirm these results.\n\nThe use of astragalus in combination with other ingredients for prevention of CINV has also been investigated. A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer shows that oral or intravenous use of traditional Chinese medicine therapies containing astragalus and other ingredients along with conventional chemotherapy reduces the risk of nausea and vomiting by 44% when compared with chemotherapy alone (102099). It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. Oral or intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer shows that oral or intravenous use of traditional Chinese medicine therapies containing astragalus and other ingredients along with conventional chemotherapy does not reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity when compared with chemotherapy alone (102099). The effects of astragalus when used alone are unclear.\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for chemotherapy-related fatigue. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral astragalus for this condition.\nOne clinical study in patients with advanced cancer shows that treatment with an intravenous infusion of a partially purified astragalus extract (PG2, Pharmagenesis), 500 mg three times weekly for 4 weeks during chemotherapy, improves fatigue scores after one week, but not after two and four weeks, when compared with placebo (33034).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne preliminary clinical study in adults with CFS shows that taking a 200 mL decoction containing astragalus 30 grams, kudzu 30 grams, codonopsis 15 grams, red sage 10 grams, aizoon stonecrop 15 grams, horny goat weed 10 grams, turmeric 10 grams, and calamus 10 grams, in two divided doses daily for 3 months improves fatigue symptoms when compared to baseline (32920). Another preliminary clinical study shows that taking 1.5 grams of a specific product (Myelophil, Samik Pharmaceutical Company) containing 66% of extracts of astragalus and danshen in a 1:1 ratio twice daily for 4 weeks improves fatigue severity when compared with placebo. However, taking 3 grams of the same product twice daily does not seem to have a benefit (32883). It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for CKD. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral astragalus for this condition.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with CKD shows that using astragalus, usually as an injection, along with conventional treatment modestly improves creatinine clearance by 6 mL/min, serum creatinine by 0.25 mg/dL, and hemoglobin levels by 1 gram/dL when compared with conventional treatment alone (90660). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were of low quality. Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes shows that taking astragalus 15 grams daily for 5 days per week in combination with standard care for 48 weeks ameliorates the decline in glomerular filtration rate, but does not improve the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, when compared with standard care alone (114803). The validity of these findings is limited by methodological flaws, including inadequate blinding. Also, it is not known if astragalus reduces mortality or attenuates the progression to kidney failure.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in adults with COPD shows that intravenous astragalus 10-60 mL (concentration not specified) once or twice daily for 2 weeks in combination with ambroxol hydrochloride and other conventional therapies improves COPD clinical symptoms, some measures of pulmonary function, and arterial blood gases when compared with conventional therapies alone (114688). All studies were conducted in China which may limit generalizability of the results. It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, ambroxol hydrochloride, or the combination.\nless\nCirrhosis. Intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral astragalus for this condition.\nA meta-analysis of results from low-quality clinical studies shows that intravenous injection of a combination of astragalus and danshen for up to 90 days might decrease fibrosis when compared with control in patients with liver cirrhosis (90662). However, it is unclear if this is due to astragalus, danshen, or the combination.\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral or intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer shows that oral or intravenous use of traditional Chinese medicine therapies containing astragalus and other ingredients along with conventional chemotherapy improves quality of life scores and increases the rate of tumor response by 52% when compared with chemotherapy alone (102099). It is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral or intravenous astragalus is beneficial for diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that astragalus, given as a daily intravenous injection 40-80 grams or taken orally 40-60 grams daily as an aqueous decoction for up to 4 months, modestly improves fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels when compared to a control group. Oral astragalus seems to improve these outcomes slightly more than intravenous astragalus. Orally, astragalus also seems to improve fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance, although its effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is inconsistent. (95909). Astragalus has also been evaluated as an adjuvant therapy to metformin. A meta-analysis of several mostly small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking astragalus 10-50 grams daily with metformin modestly reduces fasting blood glucose by approximately 12 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose by 12 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.9% when compared with metformin monotherapy (112809). A meta-analysis of mostly low-quality clinical studies in patients with diabetes shows that taking astragalus in the form of traditional Chinese medicine, with or without Western medicine, reduces fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and glycated hemoglobin when compared with Western medicine alone (114805). However, the clinical studies included in both of these meta-analyses are of low methodological quality and include only Chinese patients, which limits the reliability and generalizability of the results.\n\nSome research has evaluated astragalus in combination with other ingredients. One preliminary clinical study in adults with previously untreated type 2 diabetes shows that taking astragalus 210 mg, goldthread 350 mg, and honeysuckle 840 mg three times daily before meals for 3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, or HbA1c when compared with placebo, although glucose disposal rate is modestly improved (32925).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for diabetic nephropathy.\nMeta-analyses of small, low-quality clinical studies including over 4700 patients shows that adding intravenous astragalus to routine therapy for 2-12 weeks modestly improves blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary protein, urinary albumin, and serum albumin when compared with routine therapy alone in patients with diabetic nephropathy (33019, 102100).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nA meta-analysis of mostly low-quality clinical studies in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that taking astragalus in the form of traditional Chinese medicine, with or without Western medicine, modestly reduces signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy when compared with Western medicine alone (114805). However, this improvement may not be clinically significant. Additionally, all studies were conducted in China which may limit generalizability of the results.\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for diabetic retinopathy.\nA meta-analysis of results from preliminary clinical research suggests that taking astragalus-containing products for up to 10 months modestly improves visual acuity and fundus manifestations when compared with control in patients with diabetic retinopathy. However, the included studies had methodological limitations, and the results were heterogeneous (90655).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there has been interest in using oral astragalus for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this condition.\nGastric cancer. Oral and intravenous astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 35 randomized, controlled trials involving 2670 patients with advanced gastric cancer shows that taking either intravenous or oral traditional Chinese medicines containing astragalus in conjunction with platinum-based chemotherapy may improve objective response rate, disease control rate, 1-year survival rate, and quality of life, and may also reduce the severity of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects, when compared with chemotherapy alone (107480). The validity of this meta-analysis is limited by potential publication bias, unclear randomization methods, and substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHearing loss. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for hearing loss.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that injecting 0.5 mL/kg of solution containing astragalus 2 grams/mL daily for 10 days improves hearing in people with sudden deafness or acute acoustic trauma when compared with a control group (33028, 33033).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral or intravenous astragalus is beneficial for heart failure.\nA meta-analysis of small to moderate-sized low quality clinical studies in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) shows that oral astragalus 30 grams twice daily or intravenous astragalus 20-60 mL (concentration not specified) daily for 2-4 weeks combined with conventional treatment modestly increases left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), decreases brain natriuretic peptide levels, and increases 6-minute walking distance when compared with conventional treatment alone (114804). Findings are limited by significant heterogeneity. Additionally, all studies were conducted in China which may limit generalizability of the results.\n\nThe conflicting nature of these results are reflected in other small studies. One preliminary clinical study in adults with CHF shows that intravenous infusion of astragalus 60 grams daily for 20 days improves LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) when compared with conventional treatment (32755). However, another preliminary clinical study shows that intravenous astragalus 60 grams daily for 28 days in combination with conventional treatment for CHF does not improve LVEF, LVEDV, or left ventricular end-systolic volume when compared with conventional treatment alone (32812). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral astragalus 2.25-7.5 grams twice daily for 14-30 days in combination with conventional treatment improves cardiac function, LVEF, and walking distance when compared with conventional treatment alone (33018, 33022). However, each of these studies has methodological problems.\nless\nHepatitis B. Although there has been interest in using oral astragalus for hepatitis B, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this condition.\nHIV/AIDS. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a combination containing mainly Baikal skullcap root, glossy privet fruit, astragalus root, and Eupolyphaga et polyphage (Ailing granules) 20 grams twice daily for 4 months improves HIV/AIDS symptoms and CD4 cell counts (32824). However, taking a different combination containing licorice, yin chen, white mulberry, astragalus, and safflower orally for 12 weeks is associated with only a slight decline in viral load and no change in CD4 cell counts (32795). The effects of astragalus alone are unclear.\nless\nIgA nephropathy. Although there has been interest in using intravenous astragalus for IgA nephropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral or intravenous astragalus for this condition.\nLung cancer. Early research suggests that oral or intravenous astragalus seems to increase the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nOne meta-analysis in patients with advanced NSCLC shows that intravenous administration of astragalus along with platinum-based chemotherapy increases the rate of one-year survival by 40% when compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone (100698). Other meta-analyses in these patients show that use of oral or intravenous astragalus-containing herbal products appears to reduce the risk of death at six months by 42%, at one year by 33%, at two years by 27% to 33%, and at three years by 15% to 24% when compared with platinum-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone (15001, 90656). Additionally, a network meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with NSCLC ranks intravenous administration of astragalus along with a combination of docetaxel and cisplatin as the most effective of various Chinese herbal medicine injection and docetaxel and cisplatin combinations (114689). However, most studies included in the meta-analyses were low-quality, and all studies were conducted in China. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nMembranous nephropathy. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 48 small, low-quality clinical studies in adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy conducted in China shows that taking astragalus 20-90 grams per day in combination with a variety of other supplements, in addition to conventional therapy, modestly improves the rate of complete or partial renal remission when compared with conventional therapy (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, immunosuppression). Adding astragalus combinations to conventional therapy also modestly reduces proteinuria and serum creatinine (112010). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and variable definitions of complete and partial renal remission. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking Dang Gui Buxue Tang, an herbal decoction containing astragalus and dong quai extract, 3 grams daily for 6 months does not reduce the incidence of menopausal hot flashes (32857). However, another preliminary clinical study shows that taking Dang Gui Buxue Tang 3-6 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces hot flash frequency by up to 40% and night sweat frequency up to 53% when compared to baseline (90659). Each 1.5 grams of Dang gui Buxue Tang contains extract prepared from dong quai 1.5 grams and astragalus 7.5 grams (90659). Another small clinical study in females with moderate or severe menopausal symptoms shows that taking a tablet containing astragalus and Rubus coreanus extract 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly improves symptom and quality of life scores when compared with placebo (110478).

Although there has been interest in using intravenous astragalus for MI, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral or intravenous astragalus for this purpose.\nMyocarditis. It is unclear if oral or injectable astragalus is beneficial for viral myocarditis.\nA meta-analysis of 13 mostly small, low-quality clinical studies in adults and children with viral myocarditis shows that astragalus injection may improve the total effective rate and reduce markers of inflammation when compared with conventional treatment (110477). However, most studies included in the meta-analysis were low-quality, dosing was variable, and all studies were conducted in China. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings. Several clinical studies report improvements in cardiac enzymes, cardiac function, or viral load in peripheral leukocytes with the use of astragalus preparations, but results are inconsistent and the methodological quality of these studies is low (33084, 33105, 33217, 33218, 33220, 33221, 33223). Doses demonstrating benefit include intramuscular astragalus extract, equivalent to 8 grams daily for 3-4 months (33105) and intravenous astragalus extract 40 grams daily for 2 weeks (33218, 33221). It is unclear if astragalus speeds recovery or reduces the risk of mortality due to myocarditis.\nless\nNephrotic syndrome. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for preventing infections in patients with nephrotic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of results from two preliminary clinical studies shows that taking astragalus 7.5-15 grams twice daily for 3-6 months reduces the risk of infection by 38% when compared to control in children with nephrotic syndrome (33036).\nless\nObesity. Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of astragalus, rhubarb, turmeric, red sage root, ginger, and gallic acid concurrently with a reduced-calorie diet does not improve weight loss when compared with a reduced-calorie diet alone in adults who are overweight or obese (20347).\nless\nPost-stroke fatigue. It is unclear if oral astragalus is beneficial for post-stroke fatigue.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking astragalus extract (Sun Ten Pharmaceutical Co.

It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for lupus nephritis. There is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of oral astragalus for this condition.\nA preliminary clinical study in adults with lupus nephritis shows that intravenous infusions of astragalus 40 grams daily for 12 consecutive days monthly for 3 months, in combination with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide once monthly as an intravenous drip, can improve symptoms, reduce infections, and reduce urinary protein excretion when compared to treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide alone (32838).\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if intravenous astragalus is beneficial for tinnitus.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that injecting 0.5 mL/kg of solution containing astragalus 2 grams/mL daily for 10 days reduces tinnitus in patients with acute acoustic trauma when compared to a control group (33028).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using oral astragalus for URTI prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this purpose.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral astragalus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-size clinical study in females aged 18-45 with uncomplicated UTIs shows that taking a supplement containing astragalus root extract 100 mg, d-mannose, citric acid, dandelion, and prebiotics as a sachet dissolved in water twice daily for 5 days improves complete resolution of UTI symptoms and clearance of bacteriuria at days 6 and 35 when compared with placebo (111757). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to astragalus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using topical astragalus for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of astragalus for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate astragalus for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nA pharmacokinetic evaluation in a healthy human volunteer suggests that astragalus flavonoids can be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The major metabolites of the flavonoid constituents are glucuronides (15002).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of astragalus is the root. Astragalus contains a variety of active constituents including more than 40 saponins such as astragaloside, several flavonoids including isoflavones, pterocarpans, and isoflavans, polysaccharides, multiple trace minerals, amino acids, and coumarins (303, 15001, 32784, 32844, 98685).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of astragalus may play a role in many of its clinical effects. Mechanisms of action may involve the NF-kappaB pathway modifying gene expression (32771). There is also evidence from laboratory and human research that astragalus and its constituents reduce the formation of various inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids (12451, 32770, 32858, 32914, 32923, 33013, 110477, 112811). Meta-analyses of clinical studies shows that taking astragalus reduces levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon gamma and reduces levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (112811, 114804, 114805).\nAntibacterial effects\nAstragalus also seems to have broad-spectrum in vitro antibiotic activity (303). In animal research, the saponin fraction from astragalus protected mice against induced polymicrobial sepsis by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating the protein C pathway (32902).\nAnticancer effects\nAstragalus is commonly used in individual or multi-ingredient herbal formulations for cancer. In laboratory research, astragalus appears to promote apoptosis (32851, 32867, 32930). Also, astragalus extract appears to reverse Th2 predominant status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of lung cancer patients. Th2 cytokine production in lung cancer patients has been associated with tumor progression (32758). Lymphocyte activity has also been shown to be improved in laboratory research (419, 423, 10777, 14460, 32836, 33041, 33065, 33068).\nAntioxidant effects\nAstragalus inhibits free radical production, increases superoxide dismutase, and decreases lipid peroxidation, suggesting antioxidant effects (303, 14462, 32907, 98685). However, not all clinical research has demonstrated antioxidant effects (114805).\nAntiviral effects\nAstragalus is commonly used as an antiviral agent for various infections. Preliminary clinical research shows that astragalus can increase seroreversion of a hepatitis B viral protein (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA similarly to interferon-alpha in patients with hepatitis B (32735, 32908). Other laboratory evidence suggests that astragalus can inhibit cytomegalovirus (CMV)-AD169 (32794) and herpes simplex-1 virus (HSV-1) (32778). Possible mechanisms of action may include effects on interferon production (15104, 33079). In mice with viral myocarditis, astragalus resulted in reduced viral load and replication (33055, 33076, 33109). In contrast, astragalus exhibited no in vitro cytotoxic or antiviral activity against HIV infection (32767, 33079).\nBone effects\nWhen administered intravenously, some evidence suggests astragalus extract might increase proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells and progenitor cells (303). Astragalus extract might also inhibit the development of osteoclasts, increasing bone area (32776). Other laboratory research shows that an isoflavonoid isolated from astragalus, formononetin, increases activity of osteoblasts and differentiation of mesenchymal cells at a fracture site (32919, 32965).\nCardiovascular effects\nAstragalus is often promoted for its effects on the cardiovascular system. Astragalus is thought to cause vasodilation and increase cardiac output which might be beneficial in angina, congestive heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction (303). In animal models of heart failure and in humans, astragalus appears to increase myocardial and renal function, possibly due to diuretic and natriuretic effects (15103, 32849). In animal models of coxsackie viral myocarditis, astragalus appears to reduce myocardial lesion size and viral titers (15105).\nFertility effects\nThere is interest in astragalus for increasing fertility. In vitro, astragalus appears to increase sperm motility (14461, 32785).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThe anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of astragalus may play a role in the gastroprotective effects of astragalus. In an animal model, astragalus reduced symptoms of colitis, possibly by acting as an antioxidant and reducing synthesis of adhesion molecules or cytokine activity (32814, 32900).\nGlucose-lowering effects\nIn animal and human research, astragalus and its constituents have been shown to lower blood glucose (33101, 32805, 114805). This may be due to the effect of constituents on protein tyrosine phosphorylase, protein kinase C, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities, thereby altering insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake and use (32822, 32949, 33107). Also, the isoflavone constituents, formononetin and biochanin A, are potent activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), used to restore glycemic balance (32818). Both human and laboratory research suggests that astragalus may also aid in the protection against the formation of glycated end products, including protein (32854, 32873, 32917).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAstragalus is often promoted for its effects on the liver. In individuals with chronic hepatitis, astragalus seems to improve liver function as demonstrated by improvement in serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels (303). Laboratory research suggests the liver protective effects of astragalus may be related to the matrix collagen through effects on levels of metalloproteinases and inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines (32931, 32950, 32999).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nAstragalus is often promoted for its effects on the immune system and seems to improve the immune response. In vitro, the polysaccharide constituents appear to bind and activate B cells and macrophages, but not T cells (14500). Astragalus potentiates the effects of interferon, increases antibody levels of IgA and IgG in nasal secretions and serum, and increases interleukin-2 levels (IL-2) (303, 14464, 15104, 32859). It also seems to improve the response of mononuclear cells and stimulate lymphocyte production (10777). Astragalus seems to potentiate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity in vitro when used in combination with IL-2 (14460), as well as natural killer cell activity (32764).\n\nIn laboratory research, astragalus may increase the number or activity of T helper cells (32746, 32825, 32837, 32997, 33025), alter cytokine production levels (32746, 32837, 32953, 33069, 112811), and increase the activation of macrophages (33039, 33061). In humans, astragalus may also increase T cell activity and the quantity and activity of dendritic cells (32815, 32831, 32897, 32924). A meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies shows that taking astragalus stimulates the immune system as suggested by increased levels of CD3, a biomarker and activator of T cells, and increased CD4/CD8 ratio, indicating a shift toward favorable immune responses (112811).\n\nThere is preliminary evidence that astragalus extracts can restore or improve immune function in cases of immune deficiency (423, 3713, 32841). Astragalus seems to restore in vitro T-cell function which is suppressed in cancer patients (423, 14463). In animal models, an astragalus extract can reverse cyclophosphamide-induced immune deficiency (3713). However, although lower doses of astragalus appear to stimulate the immune system, but doses in excess of 28 grams might suppress immunity (303).\n\nThere is also interest in using astragalus to prevent exercise-induced changes in immune function. A very small clinical study in male professional rowers shows that taking astragalus root 1000 mg daily for 6 weeks may attenuate some of the immunologic changes associated with acute and long-term training, such as changes in levels of interleukin (IL)-2, natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells (107478).\nRenoprotective effects\nLaboratory research suggests that astragalus may improve microvascular lesions by increasing local renal blood flow and promoting the glomerular filtration rate. Some evidence also suggests that there are improvements in the imbalance of vasoactivators and improving the function of endothelial cells (32862). Renoprotection has been shown in animal models with astragalus alone or in combination with dong quai (32890, 32903).\nVasorelaxant effects\nAstragalus is commonly used for its vasorelaxant effects. Its isoflavone constituent formononetin has been shown to have vasorelaxant effects in laboratory research, by a mechanism possibly related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (32906).\nWound-healing effects\nAstragalus is commonly used for its wound-healing effects. The viability of fibroblasts taken from patients with diabetic foot ulcer was found to be enhanced when exposed to a combination of astragalus and rehmannia (32868)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, the pharmacokinetics of atractylodin, a major bioactive constituent of Atracytylodes lancea, follow a one-compartment model and are comparable following single- and multiple-dose administration. In healthy volunteers, oral administration of Atractylodes lancea rhizome results in rapid and variable absorption of atractylodin with an overall low bioavailability. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 0.5-2 hours, with a mean of 1 hour, and range from 7.1-152.7 ng/mL. No accumulation or dose-dependent effects were observed (106045).\nDistribution\nFollowing single- and multiple-dose oral administration of 1 gram of a standardized ethanolic extract of Atractylodes lancea rhizome to healthy volunteers, the apparent volume of distribution of atractylodin is large, ranging from 3.6 to 31.6 L/kg (106045).\nMetabolism\nAtractylodin does not appear to undergo autoinduction or autoinhibition (106045).\nExcretion\nAtractylodin undergoes rapid clearance from plasma with a half-life of about 1 hour. Most patients clear atractylodin within 4 hours of oral administration (106045).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of atractylodes is the rhizome. The rhizomes of several closely related atractylodes species contain multiple constituents, including sesquiterpenoids, such as atractylenolides and atractylon, sterols, L-phenylalanine, and essential oils that contain beta-eudesmol and hinesol (12445, 12446, 12447, 12457, 94302, 94305). Other constituents include juniper camphor, atractyloside A, and eudesm4(15),7-diene-9a,11-diol (94302). Preparing atractylodes as a stir fry, a common method of processing, changes the sesquiterpene content. After stir frying, levels of atractylon decrease, while levels of atractylenolide II and III increase. Atractylon is degraded by the stir frying process to atractylenolide II and III (15710, 94305). This is thought to lower the toxic potential of atractylodes products (15710, 94305). Atractylenolide levels also appear to depend on the growth habitat of the plant (94306).\nAcaricidal effects\nIn vitro, a methanolic extract of Atractylodes ovata rhizome demonstrates activity against the dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, with a higher rate of toxicity and efficacy than DEET and other chemicals, such as benzyl benzoate. The sesquiterpenoid constituents atractylenolide III and atractylon are the active constituents against these mites (15707).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using atractylodes to treat cancer. Laboratory research suggests that it can inhibit the invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells and neuroblastoma cells. In animal models, atractylodes extract inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, prolonging survival. There is also evidence indicating that atractylodes constituents have both apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects (94303). Atractylenolide I and atractylon constituents are thought to have anticancer activity by inducing apoptosis and cytotoxic effects against leukemia and other cancer cell lines. Atractylenolide II and III do not seem to have similar anticancer effects (12457, 15706, 15710, 15712). The sesquiterpenoid beta-eudesmol from Atractylodes lancea is thought to have anticancer activity by inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro and in animal models (15708).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn laboratory research, atractylodes japonica improves glucose uptake by reducing insulin resistance in adipocytes (94300).\nAnti-gout effects\nAnimal research in mice with chemically-induced hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis shows that taking atractylodes extract 50-200 mg/kg orally daily for 7 days lowers serum uric acid levels and improves renal fibrosis, renal tubule dilation, and synovial inflammation when compared with control (110617).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAtractylodes has anti-inflammatory activity. Extracts of Atractylodes macrocephala, japonica, and lancea seem to have cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity (12451, 12452, 12454, 94303). A lipophilic extract of Atractylodes lancea also appears to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase, likely due to the constituents atractylon and atractylochromene (15293, 94303). In vitro, the constituents atractylenolide I and III also decrease tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages; however, atractylenolide I appears to be a more potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha than atractylenolide III (15709). Atractylenolide III also seems to decrease the production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 (94303).\n\nIn vitro, a standardized ethanolic extract of Atractylodes lancea, beta-eudesmol, and atractylodin significantly inhibit the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Single- and multiple-dose oral administration of the standardized ethanolic extract of Atractylodes lancea also appears to decrease the production of other inflammatory cytokines (106046).\nAnti-platelet effects\nIn laboratory research, the atractylodes constituents, atractylenolides II and III, have been shown to reduce platelet activation (94299).\nAnti-viral effects\nAtractylodes might have activity against HIV protease (12456).\nAntimicrobial effects\nAtractylodes might have antifungal and anti-bacterial activity (12455, 94303). An extract of Atractylodes japonica and a specific constituent, (6E,12E)-tetradecadiene-8,10-diyne1,3-diol (TDEA), has antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (94301).\nAppetite effects\nAtractylenolide I, a constituent of atractylodes, appears to stimulate appetite and improve functional status in cancer patients with cachexia. This activity is possibly attributed to a reduction in interleukin 1 (IL-1) levels, an increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels, and a decrease in proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) (15706).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAtractylodes is used in traditional Japanese and Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal conditions. Preliminary research shows that atractylodes essential oils might delay gastric emptying and inhibit gastric secretion (12448). The beta-eudesmol constituent seems to have an H2-antagonist effect (12449). Beta-eudesmol and hinesol seem to enhance intestinal motility (12450). In addition, atractylodes might protect against ulcers. Animal research suggests that this may be due to an inhibition of gastric secretion and reduced ulceration (94303).\n\nSome research suggests that atractylodes might protect against gastrointestinal damage caused by some medications. The atractylodes constituent (6E,12E)-tetradecadiene-8,10-diyne-1,3-diol diacetate (TDEYA) seems to protect against gastric mucosal damage caused by indomethacin. This constituent might protect against oxygen radical formation and gastric mucosal damage by suppressing xanthine oxidase (15292). Additionally, animal research suggests that atractylodes taken with cefradine and gentamycin protects the diversity and richness of microbial colonies normally damaged by antibiotics. Researchers theorize that atractylodes could impact phospholipid and amino acid metabolism, increasing the level of prostaglandin E2, and thereby inhibiting gastric output and inflammatory action. Additionally, concomitant treatment with atractylodes promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria and impedes pathogenic bacteria proliferation, protecting microbial equilibrium disturbed by antibiotic administration (112829).\n\nIn an animal model of ulcerative colitis, treating subjects with atractylodes volatile oil (AVO) relieves bloody diarrhea, colon shortening, and colonic inflammation. An investigation into immune-related cytokines normally dysregulated in ulcerative colitis shows that AVO increases anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 but does not impact levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-17 and interferon-gamma. This research also supports the assertion that AVO decreases harmful gut bacteria, increases levels of beneficial bacteria, and regulates microbiota metabolic pathways related to intestinal homeostasis (112826).\nImmune effects\nSome atractylodes species might modulate the intestinal immune system (12452, 12453). Glycoproteins extracted from Atractylodes macrocephala also stimulate splenocyte and lymphocyte proliferation, antibody production, and cytokine secretion (15711). Single- and multiple-dose oral administration of a standardized ethanolic extract of Atractylodes lancea appears to increase production of lymphocyte subpopulations, including natural killer, CD4+, and CD8+ cells (106046).\nWeight effects\nAnimal research in mice fed high-fat diets shows that taking atractylodes root extract 25-50 mg/kg orally daily for 8 weeks ameliorates weight gain when compared with control. Atractylodes also improved cholesterol levels and hepatic steatosis (110616)."

It is native to Europe and North Africa, growing primarily in damp meadows (99059). It has been known for over 2000 years that the autumn crocus plant is poisonous (99058). It contains significant amounts of colchicine. The plant resembles onion, wild garlic, and wild leek, which can lead to accidental ingestion resulting in colchicine poisoning (33947, 99056, 99058, 99059, 99060). Since the 6th century AD, extracts of autumn crocus have been used to treat gout and rheumatoid arthritis (99058).

Autumn crocus contains colchicine and can cause acute poisoning. Accidental poisoning has occurred after oral ingestion when autumn crocus is mistaken for onions, wild garlic, or wild leeks (99057, 99060). Long-term use of prescription colchicine is associated with agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and peripheral neuritis (6).\n\nTopically, handling fresh slices of autumn crocus corms can cause finger numbness (6).\nCardiovascular\nPredominant cardiovascular symptoms of oral autumn crocus poisoning include tachycardia, hypotension, and reduced cardiac output (99057, 99058, 99059, 99060, 111190). Arrhythmias can also occur, and cardiovascular collapse, refractory cardiogenic shock, or sudden asystole have been reported as causes of death within 30-72 hours after poisoning (33947, 99057, 99058, 99059). Acute myocardial injury is associated with an elevated troponin 1 level, which can be used as a marker of severe toxicity (111190).\nless\nDermatologic\nAlopecia has been reported during the recovery phase from acute oral autumn crocus poisoning, about 7-21 days after oral ingestion (33947, 99057, 99060).\nless\nEndocrine\nPredominant endocrine symptoms of autumn crocus poisoning include metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypoglycemia (99057, 99058).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal symptoms are often the first signs of autumn crocus poisoning and include burning of the mouth, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ileus.

All parts of the plant contain colchicine, with the highest concentration being found in the corm (99058). Colchicine is the constituent responsible for both the therapeutic and adverse effects of autumn crocus (2). Cases of toxicity are generally due to ingestion of the leaves, which contain 0.15% to 0.4% colchicine (111190).\nToxic effects\nColchicine's toxicity is primarily due to inhibition of cell division and preventing DNA synthesis. It arrests mitosis in metaphase by binding to the intracellular protein tubulin, preventing microtubule polymerization and spindle formation (33947, 99056, 99057, 99058, 99059, 111190). Colchicine is especially toxic to tissues with rapid cell turnover, such as the intestinal mucosa and bone marrow (33947, 99059). In tissues with slower cell turnover, colchicine interferes with other cell processes involving tubulin, including protein assembly, cell shaping, mobility, transport, phagocytosis, and exocytosis (33947)."

Consuming a diet rich in avocados seems to improve serum lipid levels.\nConsuming a diet rich in avocados (e.g., 0.5-2 avocados daily or a diet in which avocados account for 75% of total daily fat intake) for 1-4 weeks seems to lower total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. It may also increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) serum cholesterol levels (668, 669, 670, 671, 33256). In contrast, a meta-analysis of 8 clinical studies in adults with various metabolic conditions shows that consuming avocado 99-330 grams daily for 3-24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 5 mg/dL but does not reduce LDL cholesterol or triglycerides or increase HDL cholesterol when compared with diets containing no or low amounts of avocado.

It is unclear if consuming avocados is beneficial for weight loss or prevention of weight gain.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials and a very large clinical study in adults with overweight, obesity, and elevated waist circumference shows that consuming one avocado daily or 136-200 grams daily for 6 weeks to 6 months does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), percent fat mass, or visceral adipose tissue when compared with control (112433, 112436). However, a small study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that consuming one avocado daily for 12 weeks changes abdominal adiposity distribution among females, but not males, when compared with no avocado consumption. No significant effects were observed for glucose or insulin outcomes (108008).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that eating half of an avocado with lunch increases satisfaction by 23% to 26% and decreases desire to eat by 28% to 40% when compared with a control lunch with no avocado (93109). A large observational study in the same population has found that habitual consumption of avocado at an average intake of 32 grams or more daily is not associated with reductions in body weight or body mass index (BMI) over 5 years when compared with no avocado consumption. Additionally, this study suggests that while habitual avocado consumption in patients with normal weight may slightly attenuate increases in body weight and BMI, it does not seem to reduce the odds of these patients becoming overweight or developing obesity over time when compared with no avocado intake (100936).\nless\nPsoriasis. Topical avocado has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with psoriasis shows that applying a specific cream containing avocado oil and vitamin B12 (Regividerm, Regeneratio Pharma AG) 0.7 mg/gram to the affected area for 12 weeks reduces symptoms to a similar extent when compared with calcipotriol ointment (Psorcutan). The avocado combination cream also causes significantly less irritation than calcipotriol (14909). It is unclear if these effects are due to avocado, vitamin B12, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate avocado for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn general, avocado fruits weigh between 200 grams and 500 grams (668). The most commonly consumed variety of avocado in the US is Hass. A medium-sized fruit weighs about 136 grams and contains about 13 grams of oleic acid, which is comparable to the amount of oleic acid in 1.5 oz (42 grams) of almonds or 2 tablespoons (26 grams) of olive oil (108007).\n\nAvocado oil products are commonly used for cooking and other purposes; however, concerns about the quality and purity of these products exist. An analysis of several commercially available avocado oils in the US has found that most products were oxidized prior to reaching the labelled expiration date, suggesting the use of rotten or damaged fruits, as well as improper storage. Additionally, many products were adulterated with soybean oil. In fact, some were found to be 100% soybean oil rather than avocado oil. The fatty acid and vitamin E content in these avocado oil products also varied considerably (103897).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of avocado are the fruit, leaves, and seed. Among fruits, avocado contains more protein and fiber than most. Avocado is rich in oil (15-30 grams/100 grams of fresh fruit) that is mainly monounsaturated. It is a good source of linoleic acid. Its high fiber content might be responsible for its cholesterol-lowering effects (11010). Avocado is also rich in potassium and beta-sitosterol and contains a variety of phytochemicals and essential nutrients, including manganese, phosphorous, iron, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, and folate (11010, 93116). Avocado is relatively low in sodium and simple sugars and is cholesterol-free (11010, 93116).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with overweight or obesity shows that adding a half or whole avocado to a single meal in place of isocaloric carbohydrate contents improves flow-mediated vasodilation, a marker of endothelial function, when compared with an isocaloric control meal consisting mostly of carbohydrates. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it may be related to a reduction in peak postprandial blood glucose which was also observed in this study (100937). Taking avocado pulp 600 mg before exercise also seems to allow a more rapid return to normal heart rate and blood pressure when compared with placebo (103896).\nChemopreventive effects\nPersenone A and B, compounds extracted from avocado, function as antioxidants and may be effective chemopreventive agents in inflammation-associated carcinogens (33237, 33258). The tumor-protective effect of avocado has also been speculated to be due to high amounts of polyunsaturated acids (linolenic and alpha-linolenic acid). The anti-carcinogenic effect exhibited by olive oil is thought to be due to monounsaturated fatty acids present, including oleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. Avocado oil and olive oil were found to have similar amounts of free fatty acids, but it is hypothesized that differences in their effects on cancer development is related to the interaction of these acids with factors that promote tumor development. Avocado contains a higher percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids than polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (33255).\nGlycemic effects\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with overweight or obesity shows that adding a half or whole avocado to a single meal in place of isocaloric carbohydrate content reduces peak postprandial blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL and lowers the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses overall when compared with an isocaloric control meal consisting mostly of carbohydrates (100937). This effect is due to the replacement of carbohydrates which, when ingested, increase glucose concentrations in the blood and stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. It is not clear if the consumption of avocado with a normal diet would reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.\nLipid effects\nSeveral clinical trials have demonstrated that diets rich in avocado can lower plasma lipids. The cholesterol lowering effects may be due to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids and other compounds, including tocopherols, oleic acid, vitamin E, sterols and volatile oils (669, 670, 671, 668, 675).\nLysyl oxidase inhibitory effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that compound C, isolated from avocado seed oil, inhibits lysyl oxidase activity. Its activity is increased in the presence of tissue remodeling, as in burn scars, wound healing, hepatic fibrosis, granuloma, and lung fibrosis. The lysyl oxidase inhibitory activity of avocado seed oil may explain its use in the treatment of connective tissue disorders (33242, 33246).\nRenal effects\nIn hypertensive rats subjected to adrenergic stimulation, avocado oil decreases blood pressure, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the kidneys, and alleviates kidney damage, possibly through improvements in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (108012).\nWeight effects\nCross-sectional population studies have found that greater avocado consumption is associated with improvements in anthropometric measurements of obesity and body composition (e.g., body weight, body mass index, waist circumference) in adults (108009), but not in adolescents (108011)."

Short-term use of oral avocado soy unsaponifiables in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis seems to reduce pain, disability, and analgesic use. Longer-term use in patients with hip osteoarthritis might reduce disease progression and joint space narrowing in those with more severe disease, but effects on pain and joint space narrowing in those with less severe disease are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific type of avocado soy unsaponifiables (Piascledine 300, Laboratoires Expanscience) 300 mg or 600 mg daily for 3-12 months reduces pain and overall disability by small to moderate amounts. Specifically, six patients would need to take this product in order for one patient to see an improvement (100556). Individual clinical studies included in the meta-analysis also show that avocado soy unsaponifiables improve osteoarthritis pain and severity scores and reduce analgesic use when compared with placebo (10693, 33238, 33257). Avocado soy unsaponifiables also seem to be as effective for pain reduction as chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily when used for 6 months (100559). However, not all evidence shows that avocado soy unsaponifiables are beneficial for treating osteoarthritis. Another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific type of avocado soy unsaponifiables (Arthrocen, Pharmin) 300 mg daily for 6 months improves joint internal and lateral joint tenderness but does not improve crepitus, shrug sign, pain, stiffness, activities of daily living, or function when compared with placebo (112283).\n\nLonger-term studies in patients with hip osteoarthritis have investigated the effect of avocado soy unsaponifiables on disease progression. Taking avocado soy unsaponifiables 300 mg daily for 3 years reduces the number of patients with disease progression by approximately 20% when compared with placebo (100557). Also, in patients with advanced joint space narrowing, taking avocado soy unsaponifiables 300 mg daily for 2 years decreases the progression of joint space narrowing by approximately 50% when compared with placebo (10694). However, avocado soy unsaponifiables may not be effective for reducing pain or joint space narrowing in patients with less severe hip osteoarthritis when used for more than one year (10694, 100557). It is possible that these studies were not adequately powered to detect a difference between groups for these outcomes.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBack pain.

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nOne commercially available product (Piascledine 300, Laboratoires Expanscience) has been used in the majority of the available clinical research. This product has a 1:2 ratio of avocado to soy unsaponifiables (10693, 10694, 33238, 33257, 100551, 100552, 100556, 100557, 100560, 100561, 108038). Another commonly studied product (Flexi-Smart, Smart City, Smart Nutrition Ltd.) also has a 1:2 ratio of avocado to soy (100558).\n\nA manufacturer-funded (Laboratoires Expansciene) analysis of seven commercially available avocado soy unsaponifiable products has found highly variable compositions of these products. Nearly all products have been found to contain tocopherols and sterols in varying amounts, but only one product (Piascledine E-ASU, Laboratoires Expansciene) has been found to contain alkyl furans, alkyl triols, and more than trace amounts of squalene (108038). However, it is unclear which constituents contribute to the clinical effects of avocado soy unsaponifiables or whether there are constituents in the other six products that are not present in Piascledine E-ASU.\n\nIn some countries, avocado soy unsaponifiable products are considered a drug and are available by prescription (100551). In the United States, avocado soy unsaponifiables are classified as a dietary supplement. Various supplement products are available (Avoca ASU, Nutramax Laboratories Inc.; Maximize ASU 300/SierraSil, Maximum International Inc.; Arthrocen, Pharmin, USA, LLC; AvoSol, Helseudsalg; Avosoy, Dr. Theos Official; AvoVida, Swanson Health Products Cosamin ASU, Nuramax Laboratories) (100551, 100554, 100555). However, many of these products have not been clinically studied, and many contain other ingredients, including glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, iron, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), green tea extract, vitamin C, vitamin E, manganese, and/or phytosterols (100551).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of avocado soy unsaponifiables.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAvocado soy unsaponifiables are an extract derived from avocado oils and soybean oils (100551). Products typically consist of approximately 33% avocado and 66% soybean compounds (100551, 100552). Unsaponifiables are compounds that do not saponify, which means that they are not capable of turning to soap during the appropriate reactions (100551).\n\nAvocado soy unsaponifiables contain tocopherols, phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, and other constituents (100551, 100562, 108038). Not all products containing avocado soy unsaponifiables contain the same constituents. For example, only some products appear to contain citrostadienol, a compound from avocado unsaponifiables, and others contain brassicasterol, which is not thought to be common in avocado or soy (100551, 100552, 108038). Also, since some products are proprietary and contain compounds obtained by a patented process, the exact composition is not known (100551, 100552). The differences in constituents between products are potentially due to differences in methods of analysis or preparation (100551, 100553, 108038).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAvocado soy unsaponifiables may reduce inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, increase anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, and decrease levels of inflammatory mediators and enzymes such as prostaglandin E2 and metalloproteinase (33259, 100562, 112283). Furthermore, in gingival cells, avocado soy unsaponifiables have anti-inflammatory effects which reduce the quantity of enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of gingival connective tissue (33239).\nAnti-parasitic effects\nIn an animal schistosomiasis model, avocado soy unsaponifiables reduced worm burden, when used alone and with praziquantel. The anti-inflammatory effects of avocado soy unsaponifiables possibly played a role (100564).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn humans, avocado soy unsaponifiables have been shown to reduce levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, suggesting at least some antioxidant effects (100551).\nJoint health effects\nThere is interest in using avocado soy unsaponifiables in osteoarthritis. In vitro, avocado soy unsaponifiables have been shown to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as inflammatory mediators and enzymes such as prostaglandin E2 and metalloproteinase in chondrocytes (33259, 100551, 100555, 100562). Furthermore, avocado soy unsaponifiables seem to have structure modifying effects in vitro, by inhibiting cartilage degradation and promoting cartilage repair (10695, 33262, 100551). Some laboratory evidence suggests that inhibition of inflammatory cells in the joint and the free radical scavenger constituents of avocado soy unsaponifiables, such as tocopherol and beta-sitosterol, might play a role in this effect (33260).\nPeriodontal effects\nIn an animal periodontitis model, giving avocado soy unsaponifiables improves bone repair. The anti-inflammatory effects of avocado soy unsaponifiables possibly affected gene expression, resulting in reduced activity of osteoclasts and increased activity of osteoblasts (100565). In vitro, avocado soy unsaponifiables inhibited the effects of inflammatory mediators, resulting in increased activity of mediators involved in the protection against periodontal erosion (100566).\nWound healing effects\nIn animal research, topical treatment with avocado soy unsaponifiables improved wound healing. The treatment reduced inflammation and increased tissue levels of glycosaminoglycans and collagen, resulting in improved formation of scar tissue. Later, avocado soy unsaponifiables improved wound contraction and epithelialization, resulting in a smaller scar (100563)."

Although there is interest in using oral ayahuasca for COVID-19, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ayahuasca for this purpose.\nDepression. Small clinical trials suggest that oral ayahuasca may be beneficial in patients with depression.\nIn patients with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression who are not presently using antidepressant medication, a small clinical trial shows that taking a single dose of ayahuasca 1 mL/kg moderately improves symptoms of depression after seven days when compared with placebo. The response rate of ayahuasca was 2- to 3-fold greater than that of placebo (101573). A secondary analysis of this study found a non-significant trend toward reduced suicidal ideation with ayahuasca use (101571). In addition, two small, open-label clinical trials in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder show that taking a single dose of ayahuasca 120-200 mL (2.2 mL/kg) improves symptoms of depression starting at 80 minutes after intake and continuing for up to 3 weeks when compared with baseline (92485, 92486). A secondary analysis of this research has found that ayahuasca might acutely reduce suicidality in these patients (105641). Improvements in depression have also been found in observational research (101569, 101572). However, the small size and lack of control group in most studies limit the validity of these findings. Furthermore, there is some concern that improvements in depressive symptoms with ayahuasca may be due to a placebo effect from non-pharmacological factors such as the traditional ceremony process (105640). The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Task Force suggests that only low-level evidence supports the use of a single dose of ayahuasca for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (110793).\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. Although there is interest in using oral ayahuasca for opioid withdrawal, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ayahuasca for this condition.\nProlonged grief disorder (PGD). It is unclear if oral ayahuasca is beneficial in patients with PGD.\nObservational research in patients with PGD has found that taking part in a retreat including 4-9 ceremonial ayahuasca experiences is associated with moderately reduced grief severity when compared with baseline. In addition, there were improvements in overall quality of life, as well as symptoms of distress, such as anxiety, depression, and hostility. About 50% of the patients at the retreat attributed healing to the ayahuasca (101570). However, it is unclear if these benefits are due to ayahuasca or other aspects of the retreat, such as spiritual healers, socialization, the location, and other retreat activities.\nless\nSocial anxiety disorder. It is unclear if oral ayahuasca is beneficial in patients with social anxiety disorder.\nA small study in adults with social anxiety disorder shows that taking a single dose of ayahuasca (Brazilian Santo Daime church) 2 mL/kg 5 hours before performing a public speech does not improve anxiety or discomfort, but does improve self-perceived speech performance, when compared with placebo (105634). These findings are limited due to small study size and inadequate blinding.\nless\nStress.

            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nAyahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine and beta-carboline alkaloids; the levels of these constituents vary depending on the plant sources used and the preparation methods (105637). The alkaloid quantities also seem to degrade over time (105634, 105639). An analysis of 103 ayahuasca samples acquired mostly from Europe and Brazil found large variability in active alkaloid amounts between samples. The average content and range of specific constituents (in mg/mL) were as follows: dimethyltryptamine 0.764 (0.088-2.687), tetrahydroharmine 0.995 (0.032-3.875), harmine 1.318 (0.141-4.440), and harmaline 0.085 (0.004-0.387). These samples had the following average alkaloid concentrations, with large inter-sample variability: harmine 41%, tetrahydroharmine 30%, dimethyltryptamine 26%, and harmaline 2.5% (105637).\n\nAn ayahuasca preparation used in clinical research was obtained from the Santo Daime religious group and formulated to contain dimethyltryptamine 0.8 mg/mL and the beta-carboline alkaloid harmine 0.21 mg/mL (92485, 92486). Another preparation was prepared by the Barquinha church based at Ji-Paraná-RO, Brazil and adjusted to contain dimethyltryptamine 0.36 mg/mL. It also contained harmine 1.86 mg/mL, harmaline 0.24 mg/mL, and tetrahydroharmine 1.2 mg/mL (101573). Two other batches of ayahuasca prepared by Shipibo shamans at the Temple of the Way of Light provided dimethyltryptamine 2 mg/mL, harmine 2 mg/mL, harmaline 0.37 mg/mL or 0.65 mg/mL, and tetrahydroharmine 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL (101570).",

The dimethyltryptamine and tetrahydroharmine constituents of ayahuasca have also demonstrated serotonergic activity (92499). A case of serotonin syndrome characterized by tremors, sweating, shivering, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and disorientation has been reported in a 36-year-old male who consumed 100 mL of ayahuasca while taking fluoxetine 20 mg daily (93253).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with ayahuasca.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, ayahuasca results in increased blood levels of beta-carboline alkaloids, including harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH), and dimethyltryptamine (92488, 93282). Peak levels occur approximately 1.5-2 hours after ayahuasca use (93279, 93280, 93282). Acute effects of ayahuasca start about 15-30 minutes after ingestion, reach maximum intensity after around 1.5 hours, and last for 2-6 hours (105637).\nMetabolism\nSome of the ayahuasca constituent DMT appears to be metabolized to DMT-N-oxide. This compound is found in both blood and urine (92488). The metabolism of harmine is dependent on cytochrome P450 2D6. Therefore, metabolism of harmine depends on the user-specific polymorphism of this enzyme (93281). Harmol and harmalol, the O-demethylation metabolites of harmine and harmaline, may also be found in plasma in human research (93282).\nExcretion\nIn humans, use of ayahuasca results in the excretion of both DMT and DMT-N-oxide in the urine. However, levels of DMT are low (92488, 92495, 93283). THH is the major ayahuasca alkaloid excreted in urine; the metabolites harmol and harmalol are found in higher levels than harmine and harmaline (93283).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAyahuasca is a brew that is most often prepared by boiling the Banisteriopsis caapi vine with the leaves of the Psychotria viridis bush. Occasionally, ayahuasca is made with Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of other plants, such as Diplopterys cabrerana or even other species of Psychotria. Sometimes ayahuasca is prepared using Banisteriopsis caapi vine alone.\n\nAll ayahuasca preparation methods produce a brew that contains beta-carboline alkaloids and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The alkaloids include harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (92494, 101570, 101572, 101573, 105637, 110799).\nAnticancer effects\nAyahuasca is commonly used as part of an alternative cancer treatment program. Preliminary evidence suggests that the ayahuasca constituent harmine can reduce the growth of cancer cells and induce apoptosis (92488). The ayahuasca constituent DMT is also thought to induce cancer cell apoptosis (92488).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nAyahuasca has a long traditional use for depression and anxiety (92499, 101569). However, there is some concern that reduced depression and anxiety after ayahuasca may be due to placebo effect or expectation bias (105640). Ayahuasca seems to increase blood perfusion in brain regions involved in emotional processing, introspection, and memory (92485, 101569). Some human research shows that taking ayahuasca increases brain activity (110806).\n\nIn an animal study evaluating the behavioral and neurobiological effects of repeated administration of ayahuasca in rats exposed to a new environment, low doses produce stimulant effects, whereas extremely high doses reduce activity. Repeated ayahuasca administration also influenced the neural systems involved in learning and processing cognitive events and emotions (108611). In an animal model of dependence, ayahuasca demonstrates anti-alcoholism effects by inhibiting the conditioning caused by ethanol (108612).\n\nIn humans, ayahuasca increases mindfulness and creative flexibility. These changes might play a role in the purported antidepressant effects of ayahuasca (101572, 101574). Small clinical studies suggest that acute intake of ayahuasca might have differing effects on levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in healthy adults when compared with patients with social anxiety disorder. However, these findings are limited by high interindividual variability and small sample size (108614). Some clinical research shows that the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca may be related to changes in serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and salivary levels of cortisol (110802).\n\nThere is concern that ayahuasca might reduce recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE), especially negative emotions such as fear. However, one small study in healthy volunteers suggests that consuming a single dose of ayahuasca from a Brazilian Santo Daime church 200 mL (containing an average of dimethyltryptamine 109 mg, harmine 78 mg, tetrahydroharmine 51 mg, and 7.4 mg harmaline) does not reduce the recognition of negative or positive emotions when compared with placebo (105639).\n\nAyahuasca contains the beta-carboline alkaloid harmine, which is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). By inhibiting MAO-A in the gastrointestinal tract, harmine allows another ayahuasca constituent, dimethyltryptamine, to avoid being metabolized and to reach the central nervous system. In the central nervous system, dimethyltryptamine functions as a 5-HT 2A/2C/1A receptor agonist. Ayahuasca also contains tetrahydroharmine, which is a selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake (92499).\n\nThe average corpus colosum of frequent users of ayahuasca has been found to be slightly thicker than non-users of ayahuasca, with a correlation between thickness and frequency of use. The thickness of the corpus colosum is thought to be related to an increased number and/or thickness of axons, suggesting that ayahuasca may be beneficial for the prevention of some neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro, alkaloids found in ayahuasca stimulate neurogenesis and reduce inflammation (110801).\nSubstance use effects\nObservational research in patients with multiple addictions has found that taking ayahuasca twice during a 4-day group-counseling retreat improves feelings of hopefulness, empowerment, mindfulness, and quality of life by 6 months after the retreat. Use of alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine, but not cannabis or opioids, also appears to decrease (92487). Observational research has also found that traditional ayahuasca therapy combined with purgative treatments is associated with reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with alcohol, cannabis, opioid, and other substance use disorders (105635). The mechanism of action by which ayahuasca may reduce substance abuse is not clear. There is some evidence that it may be related to both monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibition by the beta-carboline alkaloids and binding of the 5-HT2A receptors by dimethyltryptamine (92482, 92483)."
