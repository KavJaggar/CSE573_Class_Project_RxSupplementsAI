            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of damiana are the leaf and stem. Damiana constituents include as many as 35 compounds including flavonoids, terpenoids, saccharides, and cyanogenic glycosides. Some of these include triacontane, beta-sitosterol, hexacosanol, 5-hydroxy-7,3,4-trimethoxyflavone, arbutin, tannins, resins, hydroquinone glycosides, apigenin,luteolin 8-C-E-propenoic acid, and others (16304, 16115, 46935, 92313, 92314). The damiana essential oil primarily consists of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes, such as caryophyllene, cadinene, elemene, 1,8-cineol, alpha and beta-pinene, limonene, and others (16116, 92314).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that damiana leaf and stem extract has cytotoxic effects against breast cancer cells. The constituent apigenin is thought to play a role (92313). However, investigation in various cell lines suggests that damiana is unlikely to be useful in cancer treatment (92314).\nAnti-hyperglycemic effects\nAnimal research on damiana's anti-hyperglycemic effects is conflicting. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear; however, the type of extract or plant used may play a role (46934, 46940, 92314).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research suggests that damiana has antibacterial activity, likely due to the quinone arbutin constituent (4, 92314).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal research suggests that damiana might have anxiolytic effects; apigenin may play a role in this activity (92314, 102789).\nGastrointestinal effects\nDamiana has been traditionally used for gastrointestinal health, including for the relief of ulcers. Laboratory research suggests that benefits of damiana may be related to constituent flavonoids and arbutin. Damiana extracts have shown anti-ulcer properties possibly related to gastric antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (92314).\nNeurological effects\nDamiana extracts are reported to have CNS depressant activity in animal models (4).\nSexual potency effects\nDamiana is often used as an aphrodisiac or sexual stimulant. Animal research suggests that damiana leaf extract can improve sexual motivation, sexual performance, and achievement of ejaculation in impotent rats. However, it has no effect in sexually potent animals (16304). Constituents of damiana possibly induce neurotransmitter pathways in animal models (102789)."

The adverse effect was attributed to the high oxalate content of dandelion tea (258 mcmol/L) and reduced renal oxalate clearance caused by renal impairment (90639). In another report, a 58-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who was being treated with insulin developed hypoglycemic symptoms 2 weeks after beginning to eat salads containing dandelion (46960). The hypoglycemic effect was attributed to the potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of dandelion.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal symptoms, including stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and heartburn, have been reported following oral use of dandelion (19146, 36931). A case of intestinal blockage has been reported for a patient who ingested a large amount of dandelion greens three weeks after undergoing a stomach operation (46981). Also, a case of hemorrhagic cystitis has been reported for a 33-year-old woman who took a specific herbal product (Slim-Kombu, Balestra and Mech, Vicenza, Italy) containing 20 herbal extracts, including dandelion extract. Symptoms resolved after the patient discontinued using the product, and symptoms resumed when the patient began taking the supplement again four months later. While various ingredients in the supplement may have contributed to the symptoms, it is possible that dandelion extract may have contributed to the effect due to its diuretic, laxative, cholagogue, and antirheumatic properties (46959).\nless\nOther\nOrally, products containing dandelion pollen can cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (13479, 13480).

For every 5 patients treated with this combination over placebo, one additional UTI was prevented (1932). In this combination, uva ursi is used for its antibacterial properties and dandelion is used to increase urination. However, this combination is not recommended for extended use because uva ursi may be unsafe when used long-term.\n\nAnother small clinical study in premenopausal females with acute, uncomplicated lower UTIs shows that taking a combination product containing dandelion extract 50 mg, D-mannose, prebiotics, arabinogalactan, and astragalus root extract twice daily for five days, along with phenazopyridine and alkylating agents as conventional therapy, improves UTI symptoms and bacteriuria when compared with placebo plus conventional therapy (111757).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of dandelion.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of dandelion are the above ground parts and root. Dandelion leaves and root contain quercetin, luteolin, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, germacranolide acids, chlorogenic acid, chicoric acid, and monocaffeyltartaric acid. These parts also have high potassium content. The leaves contain scopoletin, aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, arnidiol, and faradiol. The roots contain caffeic acid, taraxacoside, taraxasterol, and large amounts of the polysaccharide, inulin (13465, 13476).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that dandelion might have anti-inflammatory effects (13466). Luteolin and luteolin-7-O-gluccoside possibly reduce the production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, via inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (13467). Aqueous extracts of dandelion also seem to inhibit production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (13472). Also, preliminary research suggests dandelion root extract might have leukotriene-inhibiting activity (13473).\nAntineoplastic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that dandelion flower and root extracts have antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells (13468, 13469, 13470, 46949, 46963, 46965, 46973, 46975). In a human hepatoma cell line, the apoptotic effects of dandelion were attributed to increased production of inflammatory cytokines (46949).\nAntioxidant effects\nSeveral laboratory studies have reported on the antioxidant properties of dandelion flower extract (13468, 46944, 46963). The antioxidant effects of dandelion may explain some of its potential clinical effects.\nAntiurolithiatic effects\nIn animal research, the dandelion constituent taraxasterol has antiurolithiatic effects. Taraxasterol possibly improves liver and kidney function by maintaining an antioxidant environment, which might help reduce crystal deposition in the urinary tract (99268). There may be other constituents in dandelion besides taraxasterol that also play a role in the antiurolithiatic effects. In vitro, although taraxasterol also prevented crystallization, the effects were not as large as dandelion extract itself (99244).\nAntiviral effects\nDandelion is traditionally used to treat viral infections. In laboratory research, dandelion extracts had anti-influenza viral properties (46971) and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication and activity (46970).\nDiuretic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that dandelion has diuretic activity (13475). It appears the sesquiterpene lactones found in dandelion are responsible for its diuretic effects (13466).\nGastrointestinal effects\nDandelion is traditionally used to increase appetite and bile stimulation and reduce symptoms of dyspepsia, flatulence, and gallstones. As a choleretic, dandelion is thought increase both bile production and flow to the gallbladder, and as a cholagogue, it may exert a direct effect on the gallbladder, causing contraction (46985). Also, dandelion root contains high concentrations of inulin. Oligofructans, such as inulin, are used as food sources by beneficial intestinal bacteria. Dandelion root enhances the growth of bifidobacteria and may be useful as a \"prebiotic\" (13476).\nHypoglycemic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that dandelion extract may have moderate alpha-glucosidase inhibitor activity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.83 to 3.5 mg plant/mL extract (90926). Also, preliminary laboratory research suggests dandelion might increase insulin secretion (13474).\nImmune effects\nPreliminary research suggests dandelion might enhance immune system function (13471)."

            "Overview": "Danshen is a root widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations and concoctions (47025, 94396). According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, more than 35 formulations and concoctions contain danshen, with at least 11 using danshen as the major ingredient (94398). The most common combination includes extracts of danshen with Panax notoginseng and borneol, and is known as danshen droplet pill, composite danshen pill, compound salvia pellet, dantonic pill, fufang danshen diwan, fufang danshen dripping pill, compound danshen dripping pill (47025, 94388, 94389).",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nAngina. Preliminary clinical research suggests that compound danshen dripping pill, containing danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, reduces symptoms and improves electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in adults with angina. The effect of danshen alone is unclear.\nAnalyses of preliminary clinical research, as well as individual lower-quality clinical studies, have shown that danshen dripping pill is effective in reducing symptoms of angina, although the extent of this effect and place in therapy is unclear (47021, 47025, 96442, 96443, 96445). Analyses of the available clinical research, involving up to 109 studies with 11,973 patients, show that compound danshen dripping pill, 216-270 mg, taken as 8-10 pills, three times daily for 1-6 months, is more effective than isosorbide dinitrate taken as 5-20 mg three times daily in improving the symptoms and ECG parameters associated with angina (96442, 96445). Another analysis involving 17 studies with 1,433 patients found that danshen injection as an adjunct to standard treatment options was more effective in improving symptoms of angina and ECG parameters when compared with standard treatment alone. However, details on the dose of danshen injection and the standard treatments used in the reviewed studies were not provided (96443). The low quality and high heterogeneity of the reviewed studies limit the validity of these findings. Also, the optimal dose and optimal form of danshen for treating angina has not been identified. Additionally, the effects of danshen alone are unclear.\n\nSalvianolate, a component of danshen, has been evaluated for the treatment of angina. A review of the available research shows that giving salvianolate as an intravenous infusion 250 mg in 250 mL dextrose daily for 10-14 days reduces angina severity and nitroglycerin tablet use in about 28% of people with stable angina. The patients most likely to respond are overweight, hypertensive, or experience at least 3 angina episodes per week (99069).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using oral danshen for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nCancer. It is unclear if oral danshen is beneficial for cancer treatment.\nA meta-analysis of 13 small, heterogenous clinical trials shows that taking various formulas containing danshen in combination with chemotherapy increases the odds of response and survival over 1-5 years when compared with chemotherapy alone. In patients with various types of cancer, including leukemia, and lung, liver, breast, colon, and gastric cancer, the odds of survival were increased by at least 1.7-fold (101976). It is unclear what other treatments these patients were receiving.\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral or intravenous danshen are beneficial for cirrhosis.\nA meta-analysis of results from low-quality clinical research, including 11 studies involving 1,086 patients, suggests that compound danshen injection or danshen injection 16-30 mL in conjunction with astragalus injection 10-30 mL daily for up to 90 days is superior to control in reducing liver function enzyme levels, increasing albumin levels, and reducing markers of fibrosis in adults with cirrhosis. However, the variability of treatments used as control, the wide range of outcomes assessed, and the significant heterogeneity between trials limits the validity of these findings (90662). Additionally, the effect of danshen injection alone is unclear.\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking compound danshen dripping pills containing danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol may improve some cardiac symptoms, surrogate markers of cardiac function, and metabolic indices in patients with CHD. The effect of danshen alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of the results of low-quality clinical research, including 10 studies involving 1,367 patients, shows that taking compound danshen dripping pills 240-270 mg as 10 tablets three times daily in combination with aspirin 25-100 mg daily for 4 weeks to 2 years reduces symptoms of CHD and pain when compared with aspirin alone in adults with CHD (96439). Also, meta-analyses of low-quality clinical research, including up to 19 studies, show that taking compound danshen dripping pills in combination with aspirin reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, as well as plasma viscosity and platelet aggregation, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with aspirin alone in adults with CHD (96439, 109369). The low quality and high heterogeneity of the reviewed studies limit the validity of these findings.\n\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with CHD that require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shows that taking compound danshen dripping pills three times daily for 1-6 months reduces the risk of recurrent angina by 80%, coronary restenosis by 71%, heart failure by 55%, and malignant arrhythmia by 47% when compared with usual treatment, although there was no reduction in the risk for acute myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death. Taking compound danshen dripping pills also improved LDL cholesterol levels, but not HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels (105516). The validity of this study is limited by an unreported dose of compound danshen dripping pills, unclear use of antiplatelet and other adjunctive therapies in the control group, and possible publication bias. A more recent large clinical trial in adults with CHD complicated with anxiety and depression who recently underwent PCI shows that taking compound danshen dripping pills 400 mg three times daily for three months improves quality of life, anxiety, angina symptoms, and surrogate biomarkers such as endothelin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with placebo (112398).\nless\nDiabetes. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for diabetic foot ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral or intravenous danshen are beneficial for diabetic nephropathy.\nA meta-analysis of up to 13 preliminary clinical trials in patients with early diabetic kidney disease shows that intravenous administration of danshen and Ligusticum striatum extract for 2-4 weeks, in combination with conventional medications such as angiotensin receptor blockers, alprostadil, benazepril, and others, modestly reduces urinary albumin and serum creatinine levels when compared with conventional medications alone (109380). The effects of oral danshen or intravenous danshen alone in patients with diabetic nephropathy are unclear.\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking compound danshen dripping pills, containing danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, may improve visual acuity and the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of danshen alone is unclear.\nMeta-analyses of available preliminary clinical research in adults with diabetic retinopathy, including up to 13 studies, show that taking compound danshen dripping pill at doses of 270-540 mg or ten pills three times daily improves retinal and choroid circulation, visual field, and visual acuity, and reduces the occurrence of microaneurysm and retinal hemorrhage when compared with placebo, control, or conventional treatment alone. However, the low quality and high heterogeneity of the reviewed studies limit the validity of these findings (96437, 109376). Some clinical research shows that taking compound danshen dripping pill 5 mg three times daily for 6 months may be more effective than taking captopril 12.5 mg two or three times daily for reducing macular edema and the severity of retinopathy and improving vision (109372). Additional clinical research shows that higher doses of compound danshen dripping pill of 540-810 mg three times daily may be most effective in improving symptoms of diabetic retinopathy when compared with placebo (96444).\nless\nEndometriosis. Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking danshen-containing herbal products with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) may improve postoperative management of endometriosis. The effect of danshen alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of eight preliminary clinical trials shows that taking danshen-containing herbal products along with GnRH-a following surgery for endometriosis reduces the recurrence of endometriosis by 74% when compared with GnRH-a alone. Some research also suggests that danshen-containing products reduce symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding and hot flashes and increase the pregnancy rate (109381).\nless\nHeart failure. Oral danshen has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in adults with heart failure shows taking a danshen decoction 400 to 1600 mL daily for 2 to 8 weeks in combination with conventional therapy improves some markers of cardiac function such as left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and serological indicators such as brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein when compared with conventional therapy alone (112397). Danshen comprised 75% of the herbs in the decoction and Tanxiang and Sha ren equally comprised the other 25%. It is unclear if these findings are due to danshen, other ingredients, or the combination. The moderate to low quality of the evidence limits the validity of these findings. All studies in this analysis were conducted in China which may limit generalizability to other geographic regions.\nless\nHepatitis. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for chronic hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral or intravenous danshen are beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking lipid-lowering medication and injecting 1 mL of danshen into two of four possible acupuncture points daily for 30 days decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Improvements appear to occur in 90% of patients using danshen plus lipid-lowering medication, compared with only 44% of patients using lipid-lowering medication alone (47072). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking danshen extract 3 grams three times daily for 28 days leads to increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, with no change in HDL cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo in adults with hyperlipidemia and hypertension (96441).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral danshen is beneficial for hypertension.\nClinical research in adults with uncontrolled hypertension shows that taking a mixture of extracts of danshen 450 mg, rhodiola 40 mg, chrysanthemum 200 mg, and kudzu 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks along with antihypertensive drugs does not increase response to treatment, defined as a sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 140 mmHg and/or sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mmHg OR achieving a reduction of more than 10 mmHg in SBP or more than 5 mmHg in DBP. However, taking this combination along with antihypertensive drugs increases the percentage of patients with a sitting SBP less than 140 mmHg and/or sitting DBP less than 90 mmHg by about 3.5-fold when compared with antihypertensive drugs alone (94396). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking danshen extract 3 grams three times daily for 28 days does not lower SBP or DBP when compared with placebo in adults with hyperlipidemia and hypertension (96441).\nless\nHypoparathyroidism. Intravenous danshen has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. The effect of oral danshen is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism after a total thyroidectomy shows that intravenous danshen and the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong 10 mL daily for one week reduces the time to recovery of parathyroid function by about 2 weeks, and results in increased serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels over 6 months, when compared with conventional treatment including calcitriol and calcium gluconate. Also, there was a reduction in the number of patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism (109379).\nless\nIntrauterine adhesions. Intrauterine danshen has only been evaluated in combination with various oral ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. The effect of oral danshen is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with moderate to severe intrauterine adhesions shows that use of intrauterine danshen (Harbin Pharm Group Sanjing Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd.) 5 mL, along with oral Chinese medications for 6 months after adhesion resection and balloon uterine stent placement, may improve clinical efficacy when compared with a control group receiving hyaluronic acid and an intrauterine device (IUD). Clinical efficacy, defined as normal menstruation with at least a near normal intrauterine lining and normal or slightly reduced blood volume, was 89% after treatment with danshen, compared with 69% in the control group. Uterine re-adhesion after 3 months was also reduced. However, there was no difference in the 6-month follow-up pregnancy rate (109374).\nless\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if oral or intravenous danshen are beneficial following kidney transplantation.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that injection with danshen 60 mL daily for 10 days in addition to conventional treatment improves urinary volume and creatinine clearance and reduces the incidence of renal function recovery after kidney transplantation when compared with conventional treatment alone. However, the risk of acute rejection does not seem to be affected (47019).\nless\nObesity. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nOral submucous fibrosis. It is unclear if oral or intravenous danshen are beneficial for oral submucous fibroids.\nA meta-analysis of 13 generally low-quality randomized controlled trials shows that danshen injection with corticosteroids, usually triamcinolone acetonide, improves symptoms of oral submucous fibrosis better than conventional corticosteroid treatment alone. Danshen modestly improved maximal mouth opening and moderately improved the oral mucosal lesion area and sensation of burning (101975). The effect of oral danshen is unclear.\nless\nPancreatitis. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for pancreatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral danshen is beneficial for PCOS.\nA meta-analysis of two preliminary clinical trials in patients with PCOS shows that taking danshen along with medication does not increase the pregnancy rate when compared with medication alone. However, these studies differed in their findings, with a 2.6-fold increase in pregnancy rate when compared with letrozole alone in one study and no increase when compared with cyproterone acetate in the other. Taking danshen may decrease fasting levels of glucose and insulin and improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and reproductive hormones when compared with placebo or medications alone (109378). However, the number of clinical trials in each meta-analysis was small.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if intravenous or oral danshen is beneficial for pre-eclampsia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with severe pre-eclampsia on bed rest shows that intravenous danshen 16 mL in combination with magnesium sulfate up to 30 grams daily for 7 days results in clinical improvements when compared with magnesium sulfate alone. Blood pressure reductions to below 150/100 mmHg and improvement in clinical symptoms occurred in 93% of patients, compared with 77% of those in the control group. There were also modest improvements in liver and kidney function indices (109382). The effect of oral danshen is unclear.\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if intravenous or oral danshen is beneficial for pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension shows that intravenous danshen 10-20 mL in combination with magnesium sulfate 4-10 mL once daily for 10 days modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as 24-hour urinary protein levels, when compared with magnesium sulfate alone. Also, the number of patients with a reduction or elimination of clinical symptoms was increased (109373).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this condition.\nStroke. Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral or intravenous danshen may be beneficial for reducing symptoms following a stroke.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking danshen orally or intravenously, usually as composite products, or administering the constituent salvianolic acid intravenously, might produce some improvement in neurological deficits, sleep quality, and blood flow indices after acute ischemic stroke (15538, 47002, 47017, 101978, 109371, 109377). In one study, compound danshen dripping pills prepared with Panax notoginseng, borneol, and extracts of danshen, 270 mg (10 pills) three times daily for 28 days was used (15538). Compound danshen 16 mL or 20 mL and danshen 30 mL injection have been used for up to 28 days, occasionally in combination with snake venom (15538, 96436). Other research shows that danshen injection is not as effective as danhong injection, an extract of danshen and safflower, in improving neurological deficits after acute ischemic stroke; however, the clinical relevance of this finding in the context of standard treatments is unclear (96436).\nless\nUnstable angina. Oral danshen has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with unstable angina shows that taking danshen dripping pill 0.4 grams three times daily, alone or in combination with andrographis 0.2 grams three times daily, for 4 weeks modestly improves symptoms, although the combination of andrographis with danshen dripping pill was more effective than danshen dripping pill alone (109370).\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). Oral danshen has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with multiple myeloma receiving treatment with thalidomide shows that taking compound danshen dripping pill, containing danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, 108 mg (4 tablets) three times daily for 8 months is as effective as warfarin for preventing VTE. Compound danshen dripping pills and warfarin demonstrate equal efficacy in preventing thalidomide-induced elevations in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels after 3 months of prophylaxis (96440). The effects of danshen alone are unclear.\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using oral danshen for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of danshen for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate danshen for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDanshen is most commonly used in compound danshen dripping pills, which contain danshen, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, for 1-24 months. Occasionally, danshen is used alone or in combination with other ingredients. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Doses have varied. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nDanshen is commercially available as tablets, capsules, granules, injections, oral liquids, sprays, and dripping pills, which are made by blending with excipients and dripping into an insoluble cooling liquid (47081).",

This may have been due to induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by danshen, which has been demonstrated in vitro (101977). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, danshen may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\nDanshen has been reported to have antithrombotic effects (6048, 96440).

Animal research also shows that taking a combination of danshen and kudzu (danshen-gegen formula) with aspirin increases maximal blood levels of aspirin and salicylic acid by approximately 4-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, without impacting blood loss (94399). Taking danshen increases the antiplatelet activity of aspirin and might increase the side effects of aspirin (105517).\nless\nCLOPIDOGREL (Plavix)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, danshen may increase the risk of bleeding if taken with clopidogrel.\nClopidogrel is an antiplatelet prodrug that is metabolized by carboxyl esterase 1 (CES1) to an inactive metabolite. Animal research shows that a danshen combination formula decreases the activity of CES1, decreasing levels of the inactive metabolite in the blood and possibly increasing levels of the active metabolite (94389). Animal research also suggests that taking a danshen combination formula with clopidogrel exhibits a synergistic increase in antiplatelet aggregation and prolongation of coagulation time when compared with either taken alone (112399).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, danshen may increase the levels and clinical effects of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.\nIn vitro research shows that danshen tincture and various constituents of danshen inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 (94393, 94394). However, this activity has not been shown in humans when theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, was used as a target drug (94398).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, danshen may increase the levels and clinical effects of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.\nIn vitro research shows that various constituents of danshen inhibit the activity of CYP2C9 (94393).

The maximum concentration of midazolam was decreased by 31% to 67%, and drug levels were decreased by 27% to 80% (17404, 94390). However, a single dose of danshen has the opposite effect, increasing maximum concentrations of midazolam by 87% (94390).\nless\nDIGOXIN (Lanoxin)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, using danshen with digoxin might increase the risk of adverse effects.\nDanshen has structural and pharmacological similarities to cardiac glycosides (5884, 6048, 7311).\nless\nFEXOFENADINE (Allegra)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nDanshen might increase the levels and clinical effects of fexofenadine.\nPharmacokinetic research in healthy volunteers shows that taking danshen extract 1 gram three times daily for 10 days prior to receiving fexofenadine 60 mg increases peak levels of fexofenadine, a p-glycoprotein substrate, by 27.4% and area under the curve (AUC) by 37.2% (94391).\nless\nGLUCURONIDATED DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, danshen might affect the levels and clinical effects of drugs requiring glucuronidation.\nIn vitro research shows that danshen induces the expression of glucuronosyltransferases. However, it also inhibits the activity of glucuronosyltransferases, including various members of the 1A and 2B families. The extent of inhibition of a specific glucuronosyltransferase seems to be dependent on whether or not the danshen is processed via 'sweating'. This type of processing may affect the levels of constituents in danshen that alter glucuronosyltransferase activity (109375). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nMIDAZOLAM (Versed)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nDanshen might alter the levels and clinical effects of midazolam.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy males shows that the administration of danshen for 10-14 days induces intestinal CYP3A4 and increases midazolam clearance. The maximum concentration was decreased by 31% to 67%, and drug levels were decreased by 27% to 80% (17404, 94390).

Taking danshen extract 1 gram three times daily for 10 days prior to receiving fexofenadine 60 mg increases peak levels of fexofenadine, a p-glycoprotein substrate, by 27.4% and area under the curve (AUC) by 37.2% (94391).\nless\nROSUVASTATIN (Crestor)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, danshen might increase the levels and clinical effects of rosuvastatin.\nAnimal research shows that a single dose of danshen increases levels of rosuvastatin at least 2-fold, possibly by increasing absorption and/or decreasing elimination (94395). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, danshen may increase the risk of bleeding if used with warfarin.\nThere have been several case reports of increased international normalized ratio (INR) after concomitant use of danshen and warfarin. Elevations in INR have occurred as early as 3-5 days after start of danshen (611, 612, 2237, 5883, 5884). However, a clinical trial in adults taking warfarin with stable INR found that the addition of compound danshen dripping pills, containing danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, 270 mg three times daily for 4 weeks did not alter INR levels or the average required warfarin dose when compared to baseline (96438). These findings are consistent with animal research, which found no change in warfarin pharmacokinetics with the use of danshen (94388, 94397, 94399). Other research in healthy adult males also shows that taking a combination of danshen and kudzu with warfarin does not increases plasma warfarin area under the curve, but may reduce plasma soluble thrombomodulin levels (105517). However, other research shows that danshen might increase the rate of absorption and decrease the elimination rate of warfarin (5884, 6048, 94398). Also, research in healthy adult males shows that taking a combination of danshen and kudzu with warfarin increases plasma area under the curve of danshensu, a constituent of danshen, by approximately 29.5-fold (105517). Danshen should be used cautiously in patients taking warfarin.\nless",

Interference can be eliminated by monitoring the free digoxin concentration (7331). Danshen falsely elevates serum digoxin concentrations when fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) is used (7311, 15587, 19174). It falsely lowers digoxin concentrations when microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) is used (7311, 19174). Danshen does not interfere with serum digoxin measurements using the Roche Tina-Quant turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay, or the Beckman Synchron LX assay (15587).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation and treatment of overdose with danshen.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral use of compound danshen dripping pills, danshensu and tanshinone IIA are absorbed rapidly, peaking after 3-4 hours (47014). Concentrations of tanshinones in plasma increase 3- to 6-fold following oral use of danshen (94390). However, the absolute bioavailabilities of some constituents are low (94398).\nDistribution\nSome constituents of danshen, such as tanshinone IIA and salvianolic acid B have wide distribution in the body based on animal models (94398). However, some constituents such as tanshinone IIA and danshensu do not penetrate well in to the brain (94398).\nMetabolism\nMetabolism of the danshen constituents is mainly via methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation, as well as hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and oxidation (94398).\nExcretion\nThe elimination half-life for danshensu following oral intake of danshen was under one hour. Over a period of 8 hours, urinary excretions were approximately 6% to 14% of the dose (47010). In animal research, some phenolic acids and tanshinone metabolites were excreted in the feces (94398).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of danshen is the root. The main constituents of danshen include fat-soluble diterpene quinones, such as cryptotanshinone, tanshinones, and dihydrotanshinone. Water-soluble phenolic acids, such as danshensu, salvianolic acids, rosmarinic acid, and protocatechuic acid and water-insoluble phenolic acids, such as lithospermic acid, are also found (94390, 94398, 105517). Commercially available danshen-containing products differ in the levels of these compounds, possibly due to growth conditions and habitat, or extraction and processing methods (94398).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nDanshen has shown anti-inflammatory activity in laboratory models, possibly due to the effect of constituents on the production of inflammatory lipid mediators (47038, 47045). In one clinical trial, danshen, in the form of danshen dripping tablets which contain danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, has been shown to decrease levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (109370), while in another clinical trial it did lower hs-CRP (112398). Danshen alone seems to inhibit both IL-6 and CRP (109371). Additionally, a decoction containing danshen, tanxiang, and sha ren has also been shown to lower hs-CRP in humans (112397).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn an animal model, danshen constituents protected against lethal sepsis (47047).\nCardiovascular effects\nDanshen constituents and digoxin have some structural and pharmacological similarities. The tanshinone constituents of danshen have an aglycon ring that contains a common phenanthrene ring structure like digoxin and other cardiac glycosides (7311). Danshen is thought to work for cardiovascular diseases by dilating coronary arteries and affecting cardiac function. It appears to produce dose-dependent hypotensive effects, positive inotropic effects, and negative chronotropic effects (5884, 6048, 7311).\n\nThe constituents protocatechualdehyde and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acid may play a role in vasoactivity (6048). Other constituents, including the diterpenoids miltirone, Ro090680, and salvinone, as well as tanshinone derivatives, seem to have anticoagulant properties (7162, 10649). Danshen appears to alter hemostasis and improve circulation by causing vasodilation, inhibiting platelet aggregation and decreasing clotting, interfering with extrinsic blood coagulation, mimicking the activity of antithrombin III, and promoting fibrinolytic activity (2237, 15538).\nCoagulation effects\nDanshen, in the form of danshen dripping tablets which contain danshen extract, Panax notoginseng, and borneol, has been shown to have antithrombotic properties (112399). In patients receiving thalidomide, danshen dripping tablets may prevent thalidomide-induced increases in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels (96440). The mechanism of action and the effect of danshen alone on coagulation remain unclear.\nHepatoprotective effects\nDanshen is traditionally used for hepatitis and cirrhosis. In human research, danshen reduced levels of elevated liver markers (47011, 90622). Danshen protected against liver injury in animal models, perhaps by modifying cellular messaging (47042, 47069).\nIschemic protective effects\nIn an animal study, danshen decreased cerebral cortex levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide, which plays a role in ischemia (47055). Other animal studies suggest danshen offers cellular protection during stroke, possibly by protecting against apoptosis or oxidative stress (46994, 46995, 46998, 47061, 47063, 47066, 47067). In another animal study, pretreatment and treatment with danshen for focal cerebral ischemia reduced infarct volume and significantly improved neurological function. However, when treatment was given after ischemia brain injury was aggravated (47070).\nPancreatic effects\nDanshen has been used for pancreatitis. Danshen appears to protect the pancreas from ischemic damage and improves blood flow (47045, 47079, 47080)."

When inhaled, allergy to date palm pollen is fairly common (30207, 47102).\nImmunologic\nBy inhalation, date palm pollen has been reported to cause allergic rhinitis, wheezing, rhinoconjunctivitis, and bronchial asthma (30207, 47102). Orally, date palm fruit has been reported to cause allergic reactions (30204).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. A small preliminary clinical study in females 46-58 years of age shows that applying a cream containing date palm kernel extract 5% around the eyes twice daily for 5 weeks might reduce skin wrinkles. Applying the cream reduces the surface area of wrinkles by 28% and the depth of wrinkles by 3.5% and also improves the subjective appearance of wrinkles in 60% of the patients (47093).\nInfertility. Preliminary clinical research in females with infertility shows that taking date palm pollen 300 mg daily for 1 month improves overall sexual function, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm when compared with placebo (115326). It is unclear whether pregnancy rates are increased.\nMale infertility. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking date palm pollen powder 120 mg/kg every other day for 2 months improves sperm count by 52% and sperm motility by 27% when compared with baseline in infertile males. However, these measures did not reach normal values (98655). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another preliminary study in young males with asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia, or teratozoospermia shows that taking date palm pollen 3 grams every 12 hours for 90 days improves sperm counts, sperm morphology, and sperm motility when compared with pentoxifylline 400 mg daily (115328).\nNeutropenic fever. Preliminary clinical research in children (mean age of about 9 years) with various types of cancer shows that eating 3-5 Ajwa date palm fruits (average intake 7 grams) with breakfast daily throughout cancer treatment reduces hospital admissions for neutropenic fever and infections, and is associated with a better survival rate, when compared with patients not eating date palm fruit (106734). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of randomization, dose standardization, or blinding, and the variability in types of tumor and stage.\nOral mucositis. Preliminary clinical research in patients receiving radiation and chemotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that swishing and swallowing a solution containing date palm pollen at bedtime for 6 weeks prevents the development of oral mucositis when compared with standard care with an antifungal agent and analgesics. Only 10% of patients using the date palm pollen solution required soft or liquid food compared with 80% of patients receiving standard care (98654).\nParturition. Meta-analyses of low- to medium-quality studies, conducted mainly in the Middle East and Indonesia, including patients in late pregnancy, labor or postpartum show that eating date palm fruit, 40-100 grams daily, in addition to standard care, shortens the length of gestation by 1-2 days, reduces the duration of labor when compared with standard care alone. Additionally, date palm improves cervical readiness (Bishop score), reduces the need for induction, increases spontaneous delivery, reduces postdelivery hemorrhage, and improves breast milk supply, when compared with standard care alone. However, there is disagreement on which stages of labor are reduced, no effect on the frequency of Caesarian sections, and insufficient date to analyze effects on infant outcomes (106430, 115327).\nPre-eclampsia. Preliminary clinical research in pregnant patients, with a mean gestational age of about 22 weeks and at least one risk factor for pre-eclampsia, shows that eating seven Ajwa date palm fruits daily for 8 weeks reduces mean arterial pressure by 13%, compared with an increase of 8% in patients not eating date palm fruit. Blood pressure in the roll-over test is reduced by 66% in patients consuming date palm fruit, compared with an increase of 6% in those not doing so (106735). These results suggest a reduction in the risk for pre-eclampsia, but data on the incidence of the condition in either group is not provided.\nMore evidence is needed to rate date palm for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the date palm are the fruit and pollen. Date palm fruits contain sugars (primarily glucose and fructose) and carbohydrates (44-88%), dietary fiber (6.4-11%), amino acids, proteins, and fatty acids, including linoleic and linolenic acids. They also contain riboflavin, biotin, thiamine, folic acid, vitamin C, and minerals including potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and iron. In addition, the fruit contains polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, anthocyanidins, anthraquinones, isoflavones, sterols, serotonin, organic acids, estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin-like compounds, including potuchsin (47096, 98653, 106430, 106736, 106737, 115327).\n\nDate palm pollen contains amino acids, vitamins (A, E, C, B1, B2, and B12), fatty acids (linoleic, palmitic, and myristic acids), enzymes, minerals (zinc, selenium, iron, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, manganese, and nickel), carotenoids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids (lutein, naringin, isorhamnetin, and apigenin), steroidal compounds (estrogen, cholesterol, estrone, and estradiol), and phenolics (chlorogenic acid, catechin, gallic acid, quercetin, coumaric acid, caffeic acid) (98654, 98655, 115328).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that date palm fruit extract has anti-inflammatory activity, reducing the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1-beta (106736).\nAntidiabetic effects\nResearch in diabetic animals shows that giving date palm fruit extract daily for 8 weeks improves pancreatic and beta cell structure and function, increases insulin levels, and decreases hyperglycemia (106736).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research shows that date palm fruit extract has antioxidant activity (106736). A polyphenol extract of Ajwa date palm fruit increases antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner in animals fed a high-cholesterol diet (106737).\nExercise effects\nIn young adult recreational runners undergoing a high-intensity interval training program, taking date palm seed powder reduces markers of muscle damage (e.g., creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) as well as inflammatory markers and markers of oxidative stress (115325).\nGastrointestinal effects\nDate palm fruit is a source of insoluble fiber and polyphenols. In humans, consumption of date palm fruit increases stool frequency and decreases measures of genotoxicity in fecal water. However, consuming date palm fruit does not alter the biodiversity of the colon (98653).\nLabor effects\nDate palm fruit can provide energy in the form of easily digestible and absorbable sugars, which may prevent slowing of labor due to fatigue. Also, fatty acid content is involved in the production of prostaglandins which play a role in induction of labor, cervical ripening, acceleration of the delivery process, and increasing uterine contractions (106430). Date palm fruit are also reported to contain oxytocin-like compounds, such as potuchsin (115327).\nLipid-lowering effects\nResearch in animals on a high-cholesterol diet shows that giving a polyphenol extract of Ajwa dates daily for 28 days reduces the body and liver weight gains seen in animals on the high cholesterol diet alone. It also reduces serum and liver total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with the high-cholesterol diet alone (106737).\nSperm effects\nIn vitro, animal, and human research shows that date palm pollen improves sperm motility. In animal and human research, it also improves sperm count and morphology (98655), as well as levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and testosterone (98655). These effects are possibly related to the constituent plant estrogens and/or flavonoids in the pollen (98655)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nBy weight, deer velvet is approximately 50% amino acids (5502). There is interest in using bioactive peptides within deer velvet as medicine, but few peptides have been definitively identified. Some researchers have suggested that additional bioactive peptides may be formed during fermentation or gastric digestion of deer velvet, but research validating this theory is lacking (104790). In addition to proteins and polypeptides, deer velvet also contains fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, sphingomyelin, ganglioside, prostaglandins, epidermal growth factor, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), sialic acid, phospholipids, and biological bases (5502, 5518, 47108, 47110, 110635, 110636).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nThere is interest in using deer velvet for arthritis. Animal research suggests that the ethyl acetate layer of deer velvet ethanol extract might reduce arthritis symptoms, protect against synovial and cartilage damage, and alleviate the pro-inflammatory status associated with rheumatoid arthritis (110635).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that deer velvet might have anti-inflammatory effects. In a mouse model of arthritis, the ethyl acetate layer of deer velvet ethanol extract reduced the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The researchers also found reduced immune cell infiltration and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hind paw of the mice. Researchers theorize that components in the ethyl acetate layer of deer velvet ethanol extract such as hexadecanamide, oleamide, erucamide, and lysophosphatidylcholines may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects (110635).\nAntibacterial effects\nAnimal research suggests that deer velvet might have antibacterial effects. Roundworms fed fermented deer velvet and non-fermented deer velvet had greater survival when exposed to E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes when compared with roundworms fed normal food. The study also indicates that roundworms fed fermented deer velvet had increased survival when exposed to Salmonella typhi when compared with roundworms fed non-fermented deer velvet or normal food. Researchers theorize that the findings are due to deer velvet stimulating anti-inflammatory cytokines in splenocytes and phagocytes (110636).\nAntinarcotic effects\nAnimal research suggests that deer velvet extract might counteract certain effects of repeated doses of morphine, such as the development of tolerance (5503). However, in vitro research shows that deer velvet contains myelopeptide MP-2, which is thought to activate opioid receptors (104790).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro research shows that deer velvet and fermented deer velvet both inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. This action is thought to be caused by a group of deer velvet constituents, hemorphin-5 peptides, which are known to inhibit ACE (104790).\nErgogenic effects\nThere is interest in using deer velvet to increase energy. Animal research shows that healthy mice fed aqueous deer velvet extract for 4 weeks are able to swim longer when compared with control mice. Some researchers theorize that the nucleosides found in deer velvet, in particular inosine, may reduce fatigue (104789).\nImmunoprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that deer velvet might have immunoprotective effects. A study in immunosuppressed mice shows that adding fermented deer velvet to the diet improves the viability of splenocytes and activates cytokines when compared with mice fed non-fermented deer velvet or a normal diet. Researchers theorize that fermentation may produce immune-promoting effects in deer velvet (110636)."

            "Overview": "Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) is a psychoactive cannabinoid found in the Cannabis sativa plant. It is an isomer of delta-9-THC, the major psychoactive component of cannabis (106107, 107321). The natural concentration of delta-8-THC in cannabis and hemp is low. Therefore, most delta-8-THC is synthetically manufactured from cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive constituent of hemp, via acid-catalyzed cyclization over long reaction times (106100, 106107, 106108, 106110, 107321, 110255). Delta-8-THC is often marketed for therapeutic or medicinal uses and is available in foods, dried plant products, smoking or vaping products, distillates, and tinctures (106100, 106107, 106108, 110255).",

It is not acknowledged in the 2018 US Farm Bill, and thus its US federal regulatory status is unclear. It is banned or restricted in some states, but remains legal in others (106100). Products may contain unknown or variable amounts of delta-8-THC, other cannabinoids, terpenes, heavy metals, and contaminants that may have been added or unintentionally created during the synthesis of delta-8-THC (106100, 106107, 106108, 107321, 110255, 113021). Also, some products reporting delta-9-THC levels without total THC levels, or products labeled as hemp containing CBD, might contain undeclared delta-8-THC (106108). Additionally, there are concerns about accidental ingestion of food products containing delta-8-THC, such as candies, chips, or cookies, due to packaging or labeling that mimics well-known snack food brands (114061).\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits tetrahydrocannabinols, including delta-8-THC (106110).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research suggests that use of nanoemulsions (i.e., liquid and powder) result in a 4-fold higher area under the curve compared with a medium chain triglyceride formulation, but results are mixed regarding improvement of bioavailability (113027).\nDistribution\nA rat model suggests that the time to reach the maximum concentration of delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) after oral doses of 1-10 mg/kg is 3 hours (113098).\nMetabolism\nIn vitro or animal research shows that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4 are involved in the primary metabolism of delta-8-THC. The main metabolite 11-oxo-delta-8-THC is further metabolized by CYP2C9 and glucuronidases (106101, 106110, 106111).\n\nAlthough delta-8-THC can be manufactured from cannabidiol in a laboratory, intake of cannabidiol in humans does not seem to result in detectable plasma levels of delta-8-THC after 3 or 6 hours (106096).\nExcretion\n11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-8-THC is the most common metabolite of delta-8-THC found in urine (106110).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDelta-8-THC is a cannabinoid found in low levels in cannabis and hemp. Most commercially available delta-8-THC is synthetically manufactured from cannabidiol (106100, 106107, 106108, 106110). Delta-8-THC can also be synthetically manufactured from delta-9-THC (106110). When exposed to temperatures typically occurring in e-cigarettes, cannabidiol can be converted to both delta-9-THC and delta-8-THC, as well as other cannabinoids (106103).\nImmunosuppressant effects\nIn animal research, intraperitoneal administration of delta-8-THC suppresses antibody formation (106097). The clinical relevance of this effect is unclear.\nNeurological/CNS effects\nAnimal research suggests that delta-8-THC has cannabinoid effects that mimic those of delta-9-THC, with lower potency. These effects appear to be mediated by CB1 receptors. This suggests that delta-8-THC has the potential for both abuse and withdrawal symptoms (110260). In animal research, intraperitoneal administration of delta-8-THC resulted in decreased brain levels of dopamine and serotonin. There was no improvement in cognitive performance (106098)."

    "Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid. Over 80 constituents, known as cannabinoids, have been identified from Cannabis sativa, of which THC is the major psychoactive compound (89672). Cannabis is defined by the United States federal government as containing THC levels of more than 0.3%, although most cannabis products on the market contain about 15% THC or more. This is an increase from an average of 6% in 2002 and 8.5% in 2008. Hemp is defined as containing THC levels of 0.3% or lower (99607, 99608, 109401). Solvent-based cannabis products contain THC in concentrations of 54% to 80% or more (108341).\n\nAlthough some synthetic forms of THC are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as prescription medications (e.g., dronabinol, nabilone), these chemicals are not within the scope of this topic.",
            "Warnings": "THC cannot be legally included in foods or dietary supplements in the US (99608). Due to the presence of THC in cannabis, it is considered a schedule I controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) (109401). However, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to III (113091).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using THC for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when a specific cannabis extract spray that contains THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol 2.5 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is applied topically into the oral mucosa for up to 2 years. This product is available as a prescription drug in the UK and Canada; it is an investigational new drug in the US (61775, 61820, 89460, 89913, 111095).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when THC is used orally or inhaled in large amounts or for an extended duration. Edible cannabis products containing at least 50 mg of THC have been associated with cases of anxiety, psychosis, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmia (103796). In addition, e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) is thought to be associated with THC. EVALI has occurred among adults and children who use these products. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using THC-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms (101421). Although it is possible that other ingredients, such as vitamin E acetate, may be involved in these cases of lung injury, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public to stop using all THC-containing vaping products due to the risk for EVALI (101429). Use of cannabis containing THC has also been associated with seizures, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances. Cessation of cannabis containing THC may precipitate cannabis withdrawal syndrome, the severity of which depends on the frequency and quantity of use prior to cessation (61896, 91909, 96378, 96381, 99588, 99576, 99580, 102801). Excessive and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC, either by smoking and/or oral use, can lead to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This condition is characterized by severe, repeat bouts of nausea and vomiting that cannot be alleviated by conventional antiemetics (99585, 99577). In several cases, CHS has been linked to severe complications resulting in death (99585).\nTHC likely plays a role in these adverse effects; however, it is also possible that other constituents are involved. A meta-analysis of clinical research involving adults with a mean age of at least 50 years shows that increasing the dose of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a modest increase in overall adverse effects, but not with serious adverse effects or death (105559). A meta-analysis of lower quality clinical and observational research suggests that the incidence rate of adverse effects related to use of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is low, and serious adverse events are lacking (110257).\nPREGNANCY: UNSAFE when used orally or inhaled. Cannabinoid constituents in cannabis, such as THC, pass through the placenta and can reduce fetal growth and increase the risk for preterm birth (101425, 101481, 103792, 104490). Cannabis use during pregnancy is also associated with placental abruption, stillbirth, preterm delivery, fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, small for gestational age, increased need for neonatal intensive care, and childhood leukemia (4260, 25162, 61855, 96380, 101425, 101481, 101483, 108699). Prenatal cannabis use has also been associated with long-term adverse developmental effects in the offspring, such as worsened cognition, increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, and increased risk for psychological issues during adolescence (103792, 104485). Due to the observational nature of these studies, it is unclear if cannabis causes these adverse effects. Umbilical artery Doppler scans also show that cannabis use can increase placental vascular resistance (101483). Cannabis use during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of anemia and hypertension in the mother (96380, 101481). Although the safety of pure THC has not been investigated during pregnancy, it is likely that THC is at least partially responsible for these safety concerns.\nPREGNANCY: The rate of negative fetal outcomes due to cannabis use during pregnancy may have been previously underestimated due to reliance on maternal self-reporting of use. Recent programs requiring maternal urine toxicology testing have increased awareness of maternal cannabis use and suggest that negative fetal outcomes occur more frequently than previously recorded (101481, 101482).\nLACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally or inhaled. THC is concentrated and excreted in breast milk for longer than 6 weeks after cessation of use (2619, 2620, 104894); prolonged use of cannabis containing THC during lactation has been associated with delayed motor development (25163). Observational research in mothers who successfully abstained from cannabis use for 6 weeks (confirmed by a negative THC urine screen) after smoking cannabis prenatally at least twice weekly, found that THC levels in breastmilk increased during the first 2 weeks of abstinence and then decreased but remained detectable at 6 weeks (104894). For patients planning to breastfeed, recommend abstaining from THC use prenatally and during lactation. Recommendations to discard breastmilk until THC levels are undetectable are not practical, as this may take more than 6 weeks.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nThere is limited reliable information available about the adverse effects associated with pure THC. When inhaled or used orally, cannabis can cause various adverse effects, many of which are thought to be related to THC. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nAll ROAs: When cannabis containing THC is used, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, increased appetite, nausea, paranoid and dissociative thinking, and sedation have occurred. Intoxicating doses can impair declarative memory, motor coordination, reaction time, and visual perception for up to 8 hours. It is unclear if these adverse effects are due to THC, other constituents, or a combination.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll ROAs: When higher doses of cannabis containing THC are used, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, blood pressure changes, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), hallucinations, pancreatitis, panic, psychosis, and seizures have occurred. It is unclear if these adverse effects are due to THC, other constituents, or a combination.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, edible cannabis products containing 50 mg or more of THC have been associated with myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmia (103796). In a case report, a 2-year-old boy developed bradycardia with first-degree atrioventricular block which lasted 12 hours, after accidentally consuming an unknown number of cannabis gummies containing THC (110237). Additionally, taking a prescription drug called dronabinol (Marinol) or nabilone (Cesamet), a synthetic form of THC, has been associated with hypotension, hypertension, syncope and/or tachycardia (110258, 110259).\n\nThere is case report of pericardial effusion suspected to be related to vaping cannabis 1.5 mg daily, providing 95% THC, for two months. However, the presence of contaminants in the product could not be ruled out. Treatment included aspirin 325 mg every 8 hours, colchicine 0.5 mg every 12 hours, and pantoprazole 40 mg every 12 hours (110231).\n\nA case of ventricular bigeminy and a case of circulatory collapse have been considered to be related to treatment with a specific oromucosal spray that contains THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol 2.5 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) (61759, 61820).\n\nCannabis containing THC has also been associated with other cardiovascular adverse effects, including increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and stroke. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nDermatologic\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with dermatologic adverse effects, including erythema multiforme-like recurrent drug eruption. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\n\nTaking a prescription drug called dronabinol (Marinol), a synthetic form of THC, has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including skin hives, rash, or flushing (110258).\nless\nEndocrine\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with endocrine adverse effects, including weight gain, worsened glycemic control, and acute pancreatitis. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nMeta-analyses of clinical and observational research involving adults with a mean age of at least 50 years shows that increasing the dose of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a modest increase in the rate of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting (105559, 110257). Dry mouth has also been reported in clinical research (110249). In addition, taking a prescription drug called dronabinol (Marinol) or nabilone (Cesamet), synthetic forms of THC, has been associated with abdominal pain (110258, 110259).\n\nCannabis oromucosal spray that contains THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol 2.5 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, and bad taste (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 108698). Less commonly, this product may cause red and white buccal mucosal patches to develop inside the mouth (61820).\n\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with other gastrointestinal adverse effects, including cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph. Taking a prescription drug called nabilone (Cesamet) 2 mg, a synthetic compound similar to THC, for 7 weeks exacerbated nausea and vomiting in a patient with cancer. CHS was suspected. Symptoms did not recur after the nabilone was stopped. The patient had been using nabilone 0.5 mg for 5 years to control neuralgia; however, the dose had been increased to 2 mg to help with cancer pain (110239).\nless\nGenitourinary\nA meta-analysis of clinical research involving adults with a mean age of at least 50 years shows that increasing the dose of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a modest increase in the rate of male impotence (105559).\n\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with other genitourinary adverse effects, including priapism and abnormal menstruation. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nHematologic\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with hematologic adverse effects, including hemorrhage. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nImmunologic\nTaking a prescription drug called dronabinol (Marinol), a synthetic form of THC, has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including lip swelling and oral lesions, skin hives, rash, or flushing, or throat tightness (110258). A meta-analysis of lower quality clinical and observational research suggests that the use of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a slight increase in respiratory and urinary tract infections (110257).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with musculoskeletal adverse effects, including hypotonia. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nMeta-analyses of clinical and observational research involving adults with a mean age of at least 50 years show that increasing the dose of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a modest increase in overall adverse effects, including dizziness/light-headedness, mobility/balance/coordination difficulties, somnolence, disorientation, memory impairment, fatigue, and euphoria (105559, 110257). Euphoria is also reported in clinical research (110249). Cannabis extract oromucosal spray that contains THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol 2.5 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, sleepiness, and fatigue (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 96814).\n\nIntoxicating doses of THC-containing cannabis impair reaction time, motor coordination, declarative memory, and visual perceptions, and can also produce panic reactions and other emotional disturbances. An individual's driving ability can be impaired for up to 8 hours (18, 61896, 103023). A small prospective study has found that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing THC 13.75 mg or THC/cannabidiol 13.75 mg increases lane weaving for the first 100 minutes when compared with placebo. This impairment was comparable to that of a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%, which is considered to indicate clinically relevant impairment (104482). The validity of this finding is limited because the study only tested a single dose of cannabis, which does not mimic typical real-world use (104484). Acute use of cannabis has also been associated with increased motor collision risk (61911, 61904), especially if the driver is using alcohol or other drugs concomitantly (103024). Two retrospective studies have found that state-based legalization and commercialization of cannabis is associated with increased traffic fatalities (103022, 103024, 103027). These studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and a lack of control over other confounding factors such as out-of-state cannabis tourism that could have affected driving fatalities. It is unclear if these adverse effects are due to THC, other constituents, or a combination.\n\nA case of cannabis-induced acute encephalopathy and severe dehydration is reported in a 94-year-old woman given cannabis by a family member. The product had been marketed as pure cannabidiol (CBD); however, a urinary analysis resulted positive for THC. The patient was hospitalized, received supportive care, and was discharged after 6 days with complete resolution of cognitive symptoms (111071). Additionally, 2 cases of recurrent reversible cerebral vasoconstriction requiring hospitalization and escalated care are reported in adults. Both cases involved the use of THC, history of hypertension, and presentations that included thunderclap headaches and stroke, one ischemic and the other hemorrhagic, adding further complexity to their cases that only resulted in partial recovery (112113). However, the role of THC in these cases is not well understood.\n\nSome evidence shows that the adverse effects of THC may be increased when consumed with large amounts of CBD. A small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing CBD 640 mg plus THC 20 mg increases feelings of sedation and memory impairment when compared with brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\n\nCannabis containing THC has also been associated with other neurologic adverse effects, including headache, disorientation, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nOcular/Otic\nA meta-analysis of clinical research involving adults with a mean age of at least 50 years shows that increasing the dose of natural or synthetic THC in cannabinoid-based medicines is associated with a modest increase in overall adverse effects, including visual symptoms (105559).\n\nCannabis containing THC has been associated with other ocular or otic adverse effects, including dry eye, reddening of the eyes, and tinnitus. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that use of cannabis containing THC increases the risk for cancer. A meta-analysis of observational case-control studies found that cannabis is not associated with an increased risk for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or oral cancer. However, more than 10 years of cannabis use is associated with an increased risk for testicular germ cell tumor (101430). It is unclear if this is due to THC, other constituents, or a combination.\nless\nPsychiatric\nCannabinoids such as THC can increase anxiety, confusion, depressed mood, and hallucinations, and reduce motivation (96384, 110252, 110257). Cannabis dabbing, the making of a waxy product with extremely high concentrations of THC, is thought to increase the risk of anxiety, agitation, paranoia, and psychosis (108341). When consumed in large amounts, edible cannabis products containing at least 50 mg of THC have been associated with anxiety, abnormal behavior, psychosis, and suicidal tendencies (91914, 103796).\n\nA case of erratic speech and hostile behaviors, followed by suicidal actions resulting in death, has been reported in a 19-year-old male who consumed an edible cannabis cookie. According to the product label, the serving size should have been one-sixth of the cookie, or 10 mg of THC. However, the patient ate the entire cookie after not experiencing effects within 30-60 minutes of the initial dose (91914). Due to this case and other cases of overconsumption of edible cannabis products, in February 2015 the state of Colorado began requiring that edible cannabis products contain no more than 10 mg of THC per serving or that the products have clear demarcation of each 10 mg serving if they contain more than 10 mg of THC (91914).\n\nOne small clinical trial shows that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing THC 10 mg, alone or with cannabidiol (CBD) 10-30 mg, modestly induces psychotic symptoms (110242). Also, a single dose of inhaled cannabis providing THC 13.75 mg and < 1% CBD increases feelings of anxiety when compared to cannabis providing CBD 13.75 mg and <1% THC (110254). Some evidence shows that the adverse effects of THC may be increased when consumed with large amounts of CBD. A small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing CBD 640 mg plus THC 20 mg increases feelings of anxiety, paranoia, and irritability when compared with brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\n\nUse of cannabis containing THC can be habit-forming. Meta-analyses of the available research suggest that as many as 47% of regular cannabis users develop some form of dependence, and up to 9% of all users develop cannabis use disorder (101701, 102801). In patients with cannabis dependence, cessation of use can precipitate cannabis withdrawal within 1-2 days. The risk for cannabis withdrawal syndrome seems to be greater in males, those with higher cannabis use, and those with concomitant drug or tobacco use (102801). Symptoms of cannabis use withdrawal typically last for 7-14 days and include irritability, nervousness, difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and depressed mood. Physical symptoms such as stomach pain, tremors, sweating, fever, or headache might also occur. Severity of withdrawal varies, and largely depends on the cumulative amount of cannabis used prior to cessation (99576, 101702). Withdrawal symptoms may be particularly problematic in individuals with pre-existing depression or anxiety, resulting in failed cessation attempts (102801).\n\nCannabis containing THC has also been associated with other psychiatric adverse effects, including anxiety, dissociation, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, and psychosis. However, it is unclear if these adverse effects are due to the THC constituent of cannabis, other constituents, or a combination. For more information on cannabis-related adverse effects, see the Cannabis monograph.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nUsing a specific oromucosal spray that contains THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol 2.5 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) may cause pharyngitis, hoarseness, and throat irritation (61759).\nless\nRenal\nA case of acute kidney injury has been reported in a 94-year-old adult after consumption of cannabis containing THC; it was likely caused by pre-existing mild dehydration related to a lack of fluid intake, followed by cannabis-induced diarrhea (111071).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. Although there has been interest in using THC for alcohol use disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of THC for this purpose.\nBlepharospasm. Oral THC has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical trial in adults with blepharospasm unsuccessfully treated with botulism toxin A injections shows that using a cannabis extract containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 3.2% (1 drop estimated to contain 1.2 mg), titrated to a maximum of 10 drops, nightly for 12 weeks improves the frequency, duration, and severity of eyelid spasm attacks when compared with placebo (108691). The validity of this study is limited by poor study design and lack of follow-up.\nless\nCachexia. Oral THC has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study shows that using a cannabis extract standardized to contain THC 2.5 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 1 mg twice daily for 6 weeks does not increase appetite when compared with placebo in patients with cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (61785). However, the substantial placebo effect and dropout rate limits the reliability of these findings.\nless\nCancer-related pain. Non-inhaled THC may be beneficial in patients with cancer-related pain that is not adequately controlled with standard treatment.\nIn 2021, the British Medical Journal published a clinical practice guideline for the use of medical cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic pain. This guideline states that the evidence weakly supports a trial of cannabinoids in conjunction with standard pain management in individuals with moderate to severe chronic pain and insufficient pain relief. Trials should begin with a low dose of cannabidiol (CBD) titrated to effect, followed by the gradual addition of THC, with a maximum daily dose of CBD 40 mg and THC 40 mg (108698). This recommendation is based on evidence from four systematic reviews of research conducted in patients with various forms of chronic pain, including cancer-related pain, which suggest that using non-inhaled THC or CBD for 1-4 months may modestly improve pain, physical function, and sleep, but not emotional, role, or social functions, when compared with standard treatment alone (108674). However, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in patients with chronic, cancer-related pain receiving prescription opioids shows that using a specific oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to contain THC 2.7 mg and CBD 2.5 mg per spray, for 2-5 weeks does not improve prescribed opioid consumption, sleep, or pain, and actually increases nausea and vomiting by 43% and 50%, respectively, when compared with opioids alone (108676, 111095). All studies instructed patients not to alter the prescribed opioid dose, which may have increased the risk for adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. The effect of pure THC is unclear.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if a cannabis oromucosal spray or oral cannabis extract, providing standard doses of THC in combination with other ingredients, is beneficial for the prevention of CINV.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving moderate-to-highly emetogenic chemotherapy and still experiencing CINV despite conventional antiemetic prophylaxis shows that taking a cannabis extract (TN-TC11M) containing THC 2.5 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg three times daily during chemotherapy days 1-5 prevents CINV in 25% of patients, compared with 14% of patients receiving usual care. This means that 9 patients must be treated with this extract in order to prevent one case of CINV (104489). Limited research has also evaluated a cannabis oromucosal spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) standardized to contain THC 2.7 mg and CBD 2.5 mg per actuation. A very small clinical study shows that, when used in addition to a standard antiemetic regimen, 1-3 sprays after each daily chemotherapy infusion and then up to 8 sprays every 4 hours as needed for 4 days prevents delayed CINV in 71% of patients, compared with only 22% of patients in the placebo group. There was no between-group difference in the occurrence of acute CINV, which was low in both groups (96814). This study is limited due to its small size and non-standardized treatment regimens. The effect of pure THC is unclear.\nless\nCrohn disease. Oral THC has only been evaluated as a component of cannabis products; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease shows that using a cannabis oil containing THC 4% and cannabidiol (CBD) 16%, titrated gradually to satisfactory response to a maximum of 20 drops (THC 40 mg) twice daily before meals for 8 weeks, in conjunction with standard care such as corticosteroids, improves patient satisfaction and some symptoms such as abdominal pain and number of daily bowel movements, but does not improve disease activity scores or endoscopic findings, when compared with placebo (108678). Another very small clinical study shows that smoking cigarettes containing cannabis flowers 0.5 grams standardized to THC 115 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve Crohn disease remission rates when compared with placebo cigarettes. However, the response rate, defined as a reduction in Crohn Disease Activity Index score of at least 100 points, was 90% in the cannabis group, compared with 40% in the placebo group. Quality of life was also improved (96387). The effect of pure THC is unclear.\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral THC might reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in hospitalized patients.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in mostly hospitalized patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia shows that using cannabinoids such as THC, dronabinol, and nabilone modestly improves neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and aggression when compared with control (103015). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size and heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nDiabetes. Sublingual THC has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes conducted in Iran shows that taking a specific product containing THC 10 mcg and cannabidiol 100 mcg (CBDEX10, Yas Daru) 2 puffs sublingually twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with placebo, but does not increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (113056).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if inhaled THC in cannabis vapor might reduce fibromyalgia pain.\nA small clinical study in female adults with fibromyalgia and chronic pain shows that a single vapor inhalation of cannabis containing THC 22.4 mg and less than 1 mg of CBD reduces pain scores by 30% when compared with placebo. However, inhaling cannabis containing THC 13.4 mg and CBD 17.8 mg does not improve pain when compared with placebo. Additionally, no cannabis products affected electrical pain thresholds or spontaneous pain scores (101420). Also, the effect of pure THC is unclear.\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for improvement of chronic back, fibromyalgia, or other pain in patients with fibromyalgia and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low quality evidence suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. Initiating treatment with a low dose of THC reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oromucosal THC reduces glaucoma risk.\nUsing an oromucosal spray containing THC 5 mg seems to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. However, the effect appears to last for only three to four hours (61790). The effect of pure THC is unclear.\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. It is unclear if oral THC attenuates wasting in patients with HIV.\nWhile a prescription drug called dronabinol (Marinol), a synthetic form of THC, is approved for treating loss of appetite in patients with HIV who have lost weight (6606, 11166), the effect of non-prescription THC is unclear.\nless\nHypertension. Oral THC has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small study in older adults with hypertension shows that taking cannabis oil containing 1% to 10% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 2% to 20% cannabidiol (CBD), for an average total daily dose of about 21 mg of each cannabinoid, seems to modestly reduce blood pressure when compared with baseline (104480). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group and the non-standardized formulations and dosing used. Also, the effects of THC alone are unclear.\nless\nInsomnia. Sublingual THC has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial in patients with self-reported insomnia shows that using an investigational drug (ZLT-101; Zelira Therapeutics) containing THC 20 mg/mL, cannabinol (CBN) 2 mg/mL, and cannabidiol (CBD) 1 mg/mL, taken as 0.5-1 mL sublingually one hour before sleep for 2 weeks, improves symptom severity and total sleep time when compared with placebo (108677). The validity of this finding is limited by the short duration of treatment.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). A specific cannabis oromucosal spray and oral cannabis extract, providing standard doses of THC in combination with other ingredients, seems to modestly reduce spasticity in patients with MS. The effect of THC alone on symptoms of MS is unclear.\nMeta-analysis of several clinical studies in patients with MS shows that using a specific oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to deliver THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg per actuation, for at least 3 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, but does not seem to reduce neuropathic pain or bladder dysfunction, when compared with placebo (104895). Another meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies, that includes many of the same studies as the prior meta-analysis, shows that using Sativex as add-on therapy improves the likelihood of reduced spasticity by 2.4 times when compared with placebo (113020). Limited research suggests that the benefit of Sativex might last for over 11 months and withdrawal of Sativex may cause a rebound of MS symptoms (89923, 89924). Sativex has been approved in the United Kingdom as a prescription medicine to treat MS-related spasticity (89913) and in Canada to treat neuropathic pain associated with MS (61775). This product has not been approved in the United States. The American Academy of Neurology states that Sativex does not improve objective measures of spasticity, reduce the number of urinary incontinence episodes, or reduce MS-related tremors (89460). Notably, much of the research was funded by the manufacturer.\n\nOther oral cannabis extracts containing THC have also been studied. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with MS shows that taking a cannabis extract containing THC 25-30 mg and CBD 8-18 mg daily for up to 15 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, neuropathic pain, and bladder dysfunction when compared with placebo. However, objective spasticity measures (Ashworth scale) were not improved when compared with placebo (104895). Two of the largest studies included in the meta-analysis used a specific cannabis extract (Cannador, Society for Clinical Research) (11168, 91919). A third study used cannabis extract standardized to THC 2.5 mg and CBD 0.9 mg per capsule, for an escalating daily dose of 6-12 capsules in three divided doses (61746). One small clinical study in patients with MS with upper limb tremors shows that taking a specific cannabis extract (Cannador) titrated to a maximum of THC 0.125 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks does not appear to improve tremor when compared with placebo (61739).\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for improvement of pain, muscle spasm, and sleep in patients with MS and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low or moderate quality evidence of smoked cannabis, cannabis extract, and oromucosal THC, suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. The strongest evidence of benefit has been shown with oils and capsules, as opposed to smoking or oromucosal formulations. A total daily dose of THC 10-15 mg was most commonly used in clinical research. Initiating treatment with a low dose reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral THC is beneficial for neuropathic pain.\nClinical research shows that taking THC up to 25 mg alone or with cannabidiol 50 mg in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks does not reduce neuropathic pain of various etiologies or use of analgesics, when compared with placebo (110249).\nless\nPain (chronic). Non-inhaled THC seems to reduce pain in patients with chronic pain due to various causes. The effect of inhaled THC on chronic pain is unclear.\nIn 2021, the British Medical Journal published a clinical practice guideline for the use of medical cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic pain. This guideline states that the evidence weakly supports a trial of cannabinoids in conjunction with standard pain management in individuals with moderate to severe chronic pain and insufficient pain relief. Trials should begin with a low dose of cannabidiol (CBD) titrated to effect, followed by the gradual addition of THC, with a maximum daily dose of CBD 40 mg and THC 40 mg (108698). This recommendation is based on evidence from four systematic reviews of research conducted in patients with various forms of chronic pain, including cancer-related pain, which suggest that using non-inhaled THC or CBD for 1-4 months may modestly improve pain, physical function, and sleep, but not emotional, role, or social functions, when compared with standard treatment alone (108674). Recent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines, especially THC-predominant formulations, alone and/or as adjunct treatment for improvement of anxiety, pain, and sleep, in individuals with chronic pain not responsive to, or intolerant of, non-pharmacologic treatment. This recommendation includes slowly introducing cannabinoid-based medicines for individuals experiencing unsatisfactory response from, using high doses of, or experiencing adverse effects related to, opioids. These guidelines also weakly recommend the adjunct use of cannabinoid-based medicines for improvement of depression, mobility, and nausea, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with chronic pain. The risk of non-serious adverse events outweighs the risk of adverse events associated with standard analgesics. These recommendations are based on studies investigating a variety of cannabinoid-based medicines, including oral or inhaled whole plant, extracts, and isolated cannabinoids. The use of non-inhaled products, and/or initiating treatment with a low dose and titrating as needed, reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321).\n\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic pain shows that a single inhalation of a cannabis extract containing THC 0.5 mg or 1 mg reduces pain for 150 minutes when compared with baseline. However, only the THC 1 mg dose reduces pain when compared with placebo (104481). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of continued administration of inhaled THC on chronic pain are unclear. The placebo response in the available research is moderate to large and any additional benefit of cannabis-based products is small and possibly insignificant (110230).\nless\nParkinson disease. Oral THC has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with Parkinson disease, shows that using a specific cannabis extract standardized to THC 2.5 mg and cannabinol (CBD) 0.8-1.8 mg per capsule (Cannador, Society for Clinical Research) twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve the severity of disease when compared with placebo. Dosing was escalated over the 4-week period reaching THC levels of 0.034 to 0.25 mg/kg daily (108342). The effects of THC alone are unclear.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear whether an oromucosal cannabis spray containing THC improves RA symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults with RA shows that using a specific oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), containing THC 2.7 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg per actuation, daily for 5 weeks may help decrease morning pain and improve quality of sleep, but not joint stiffness or total pain intensity, when compared with placebo (61762). The effects of THC alone are unclear.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if inhaled THC as part of smoked cannabis flower improves symptoms of ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis shows that smoking a cannabis flower cigarette containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 80 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, in conjunction with standard therapy, improves Lichtiger disease activity index scores, abdominal pain, and number of bowel movements, but does not improve endoscopic disease activity or markers of inflammation, when compared with placebo. At a 1-year follow-up, all patients who received cannabis and achieved remission during the study retained long-term remission (108680). The effects of THC alone are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate THC for these uses.",

In vitro studies in kidney cell lines show that a 1-hour exposure to CBD and THC inhibits P-gp (61769, 104889). THC may also alter the expression of P-gp, although this effect appears to vary based on duration of exposure. Some in vitro research in lymphoblastoid leukemia cell lines indicates that a 1-hour exposure to cannabinoids does not affect P-gp expression, while a prolonged 72-hour exposure decreases P-gp expression (61771). Other in vitro research in these cell lines shows that a 4-hour exposure to THC and CBD induces P-gp gene expression, while exposure for longer than 4 hours and up to 48 hours does not induce P-gp gene expression (104893).\nless\nTHEOPHYLLINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, THC might reduce the levels and clinical effects of theophylline.\nSmoking cannabis containing THC seems to increase the metabolism of theophylline (16815).

Population research has found that use of cannabis containing THC is associated with a three-fold increase in the risk of new onset of mania symptoms. Using cannabis also appears to worsen manic symptoms in patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder (91912). Following cessation of cannabis use for at least 3 months, previous users had high rates of remission and recovery with outcomes related to work impairment and relationship status similar to those that had never used cannabis (96385). The effects of THC alone are unclear.\nless\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\nTHC may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Orally, edible cannabis products containing 50 mg or more of THC have been associated with myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmia (103796).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, edible cannabis products reported to contain 50 mg or more of THC has been associated with cases of anxiety, psychosis, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmia (103796).\n\nExcessive and prolonged cannabis use can lead to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is characterized by cyclic attacks of nausea and vomiting that is not alleviated by conventional antiemetics (99585, 99577). In several cases, CHS has been linked to severe complications resulting in death (99585). THC likely plays a role in this adverse effect; however, it is possible that other constituents are also involved.\n\nAccidental ingestion of THC-containing edibles has been associated with poisoning in children ages 12 years and younger (110237).\nTreatment\nCHS is not alleviated by conventional antiemetic medicine (99585, 101423, 101424), although one case series reported successful management of acute CHS with the use of benzodiazepines (101424). Anecdotally, patients that have developed CHS use extremely hot baths to temporarily reduce symptoms (99585, 101423, 101424).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with THC.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCannabinoids such as THC are absorbed orally or by inhalation (108344). Absorption of vaporized THC appears to be greater than smoked THC, although absorption from any type of inhalation ranges from 2% to 56% (101427, 101506). Maximum plasma concentrations of THC occur approximately 3-30 minutes after inhalation of smoke or vapor (101427, 108344, 110242, 110256). Orally, approximately 6% to 20% of THC is absorbed, with a peak plasma concentration occurring most commonly between 1-3 hours (101506, 108345, 110255, 111092). A small study in healthy patients shows that consumption of brownies containing 10-50 mg THC resulted in peak plasma concentrations of THC and 11-hydroxy-THC at between 1.5 and 2 hours (104496). Various formulations of oral THC have been developed, often with the intention of improving absorption. Peak plasma concentrations of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, and THC-COOH, have been greater and occurred earlier with specific formulations (e.g., Solutech) than formulations in medium chain triglycerides (109181). A small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing THC 20 mg plus cannabidiol 640 mg increases maximal plasma levels of THC by 1.8-fold, and the area under the curve by 2.5-fold, when compared to consuming brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092). With the use of oromucosal formulations, most THC is absorbed through the oral mucosa (108344).\nDistribution\nOral or inhaled cannabinoids such as THC are rapidly distributed throughout the body and have a high affinity for fat tissues (6, 61796). THC concentrations in the oral fluid seem to be affected by direct contact between THC in cannabis and the oral cavity, and not by plasma levels of THC (104496).\nMetabolism\nOral THC undergoes hepatic first pass metabolism resulting in lower concentrations and a longer delay to peak plasma concentrations when compared with inhaled or vaporized THC (108344). Hepatic metabolism involves the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and results in the metabolites 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-carboxy-THC (11-COOH-THC). These compounds undergo glucuronidation. Some CYP450 metabolism also takes place in the small intestine and the brain (108344).\nExcretion\nTHC and its metabolites are excreted in feces and urine (108344).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTHC is a cannabinoid found in cannabis and related products (89672, 99607, 99608, 108341).\nAnalgesic effects\nThe cannabinoid constituents of cannabis are thought to be responsible for the analgesic effects of cannabis (61741, 61721). Animal research shows that THC reduces pain by functioning as type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonists (61698, 61808). However, some research in humans suggests that THC does not have analgesic effects. In healthy adults, a single dose of intravenous THC 0.01-0.03 mg/kg caused cognitive and physiological effects, but did not reduce the severity of experimentally-induced acute pain (104495). One clinical study of inhaled vaporized cannabis suggests that the inhalation of a product containing THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in combination antagonizes the analgesic effects that occur when THC is used alone (101420).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory research suggests that anti-inflammatory effects of THC are related to the cannabinoid (CB) 2 receptor. Inflammatory cytokine levels are reduced (96387, 108680).\nAnticancer effects\nResearch on the effect of THC on cancer is conflicting. The effect of THC on interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, and other cytokines suggests it might promote the growth of cancer cells (10239, 10240). Conversely, when THC is infused directly into the tumor mass, it seems to produce tumor eradication or improvements in survival in animals with experimentally-induced malignant gliomas (a type of brain tumor). THC induces tumor cell apoptosis via CB1 and CB2 receptors expressed on the glioma cells (5887).\nAntiemetic effects\nIn human and animal research, THC has been shown to have antiemetic properties by inhibiting neurotransmitter release by specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) (61706, 61721, 61771). Cannabinoids are at least as effective as prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, thiethylperazine, and other conventional antiemetic drugs (6606, 10241).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research suggests that THC has antioxidant effects. Laboratory optical and electrochemical methods suggest that THC has similar antioxidant activity to ascorbic acid, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (103019). Additional in vitro research shows that THC protects rat cortical neuron cultures from oxidative damage from toxic levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (103020).\nCardiovascular effects\nLaboratory research suggests that THC has direct toxic effects on the blood vessel wall increasing the risk of arteritis and causing peripheral vasoconstriction (96378). In vitro research has found higher expressions of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in atherosclerotic lesions from a cannabis user when compared with plaque histology from a non-user; however, the implications of this finding are unclear (108688).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nTHC seems to suppress the immune function by its action at the CB2 receptors. It increases the activity of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-4, and other cytokines that inhibit immune function and decreases interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-12, cytokines responsible for stimulating immune function. This effect might reduce resistance to infections (10239, 10240).\nNeurological/CNS effects\nTHC acts on the central nervous system (CNS) (13). THC can act via cannabinoid receptors in neural tissues or opiate receptors in the forebrain, leading to indirect inhibition of the emetic center in the medulla oblongata (13, 2619). Acute intake of THC via inhalation may also increase levels of endocannabinoids (110256).\n\nTwo types of cannabinoid receptors have been identified in animals: CB1, which is found predominantly in the CNS and is thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects, and CB2 which is found in high levels on immune system cells including leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in the brain (5887, 5888, 5889, 108688). THC is a partial CB1 receptor agonist and has limited CB2 agonist activity (5889). In an animal model of multiple sclerosis, THC has been reported to reduce tremor and spasticity, possibly through its activity at CB1 receptors in the brain (5889).\nRespiratory effects\nA small clinical trial shows that inhaling a high-grade cannabis (Bedrocan International B.V., Veendam, The Netherlands) 100 mg, containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 21.8% and cannabinol 0.1%, does not result in respiratory depression in healthy adults. Furthermore, it does not worsen oxycodone-induced respiratory depression (111096)."

Some species of dendrobium, such as Dendrobium officinale, are considered critically endangered plants (99899). Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium officinale are recognized in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia; however, other Dendrobium species are also of interest for medicinal use (99899).\n\nDendrobium has been used in some supplements for athletic performance, with some experts touting dendrobium as a replacement for the stimulant dimethylamylamine (DMAA). However, there is concern that these products may actually be adulterated with synthetic stimulants. One specific dendrobium-containing supplement (Craze, Driven Sports) was found to contain phenethylamine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, which some experts say does not occur naturally in any significant amount in dendrobium plants (17966, 17967, 17968).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe stems of dendrobium are most commonly used for medicinal purposes, although other parts of the plant have also been used. Two species of dendrobium are primarily used medicinally, Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium officinale. Polysaccharides are the major constituents in dendrobium (100586). Other active constituents include dendrobine, dendroxine, dendramine, and several others (7162, 90320).\nAnalgesic effects\nThe dendrobine constituent is thought to have analgesic effects (7162). However, these effects have not been documented in humans.\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that some but not all polysaccharides present in Dendrobium officinale appear to have free radical-scavenging effects (100588).\nCardioprotective effects\nA water extract of Dendrobium officinale seems to exert some cardioprotective effects in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia, possibly through antioxidant effects and inhibition of cardiac cell apoptosis (99900).\nConvulsant effects\nThe dendrobine constituent is thought to have convulsant effects (7162). However, these effects have not been documented in humans.\nGastroprotective effects\nPolysaccharides from Dendrobium officinale appear to improve symptoms and survival in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, possibly through suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome and beta-arrestin1 activation (100586). In vitro and animal research also shows that these polysaccharides seem to exhibit cardioprotective effects though inhibition of oxidative-stress induced apoptosis of gastric mucosal cells (100587).\nHyperglycemic effects\nThe dendrobine constituent is thought to have hyperglycemic effects (7162). However, these effects have not been documented in humans.\nHypotensive effects\nThe dendrobine constituent is thought to have hypotensive effects (7162). However, these effects have not been documented in humans.\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro research shows that a specific polysaccharide extracted from Dendrobium officinale (DOP-1-1) seems to have immunomodulating activity, possibly through stimulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production and induction of ERK1/2 and NF-kB pathways (100588).\nStimulant effects\nSome dendrobium-containing products are used as a pro-workout supplement for boosting performance. This is due to stimulant effects of some purported constituents of dendrobium. Some products contain the stimulant phenylethylamine, which appears to have amphetamine-like effects (17966, 17967, 17968). However, experts do not believe that phenylethylamine is a naturally occurring constituent of dendrobium. It's thought that some products may be spiked with this stimulant (17966).\nUric acid lowering effects\nIn a rat model of hyperuricemia, continuous administration of a macroporous resin extract of dendrobium leaf for 9 weeks decreases serum uric acid at week 8. The extract also attenuates changes in biochemical markers of liver and kidney function and ameliorates liver and kidney damage induced by hyperuricemia (105849)."

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nDevil's claw extract is usually prepared from secondary tuberous roots and standardized to harpagoside and total iridoid glycoside content. There seems to be variability in harpagoside content among various commercial extracts, possibly because some products are prepared from a mixture of two species - Harpagophytum procumbens and Harpagophytum zeyheri. These species are similar pharmacologically, but may have differing concentrations of harpagoside and related compounds and therefore, should not be considered interchangeable (8615, 108017). A DNA barcode analysis of 20 different commercially available devil's claw supplements found that H. procumbens was present in only 25% of samples, despite being listed on all product labels. In contrast, H. zeyheri was found in all samples, but only 2 of the 20 supplements listed this species on the product label (108017).\n\nIn several countries, manufacturers use different procedures to produce different extracts in which the quantity of harpagoside does not have to be declared. In contrast, the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) requires the harpagoside content should be no less than 1.2%. Standardized extracts are available which contain no less than 2.2% of total iridoid glycosides or no less than 1% harpagoside. The aqueous extract or tea generally contains harpagoside levels varying between 1.1% to 3.6% (47153, 47154).\n\nA specific devil's claw product (Doloteffin, Ardeypharm) is formulated to contain 400 mg of devil's claw root aqueous extract per tablet and is standardized to 10 mg of harpagoside per tablet (8608, 14418, 14332, 47155, 47169).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with devil's claw.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nPreliminary evidence suggests that devil's claw extract might be inactivated by stomach acid and might be more effective with parenteral or sublingual administration (8611, 8614, 8615, 8617). However, other research shows that gastric pH does not significantly affect devil's claw (8612). For example, harpagoside is stable in artificial gastric juices for about 3 hours and in intestinal juices for a period of 6 hours (8612, 35785, 47112, 47142).\nDistribution\nIn a blood sample taken from a human two hours after ingesting a devil's claw extract containing 44 mg harpagoside, the harpagoside level was 15.4 ng/mL. Oral administration of a 600 mg extract containing 25% harpagoside led to plasma harpagoside levels of 32.2 ng/mL after 1.3 hours, which subsequently rapidly decreased. A second peak was observed after eight hours (47162).\nExcretion\nHarpagoside elimination half-life has been reported as 5.6 hours (47115). Transformation of iridoid glucosides by human fecal flora has been observed (47113).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of devil's claw is the tuber. Devil's claw contains iridoid glycoside constituents primarily harpagoside, but also including harpagide, harpagide derivatives, and procumbide (8614, 8616, 47158, 47159). It also contains the phenylethanol derivatives acteoside (verbascoside) and isoaceteoside, and the oligosaccharide stachyose (8616, 47118, 47121, 47160). The phenol glycoside constituent 6-acetylacteoside allows distinction between the two species of devil's claw (47122, 47125, 47128). Other constituents include 8-cinnamoylmyoporoside, pagoside, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, flavonoids, fatty acids, aromatic acids, harpagoquinone, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, triterpenes, sugars (over 50%), and gum resins (47118, 47121, 47160, 47161).\nAnalgesic properties\nAnimal research shows that administration of harpagoside 20 mg/kg produces an analgesic effect similar to that of phenylbutazone 50 mg/kg (47137). Additional animal research shows that administration of an aqueous devil's claw extract (2.2% harpagoside) significantly reduces writhing and stretching induced by 1.2% acetic acid in rats (8615).\nAnti-inflammatory properties\nThe iridoid glycoside constituents of devil's claw seem to have an anti-inflammatory effect (6472, 8614, 47133, 47135, 47137). Some preliminary research suggests that harpagoside inhibits both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase inflammatory pathways (8612), although conflicting research exists (47115). Devil's claw seems to inhibit COX-2 (but not COX-1) and nitric oxide synthetase, a modulator of inflammation (12478, 47126, 47129). Some evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect is due to increased synthesis and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by compounds other than harpagoside (8616, 47143). Some research in humans shows no effect of devil's claw on the arachidonic acid pathway (10642). However, more recent investigations suggest that harpagoside may inhibit both arachidonic acid metabolism pathways when more complex test procedures are used (47112, 47142, 47127). The capability of devil's claw extract to suppress enhanced production of matrix-degrading enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) via the inhibition of the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines has also been reported (47124, 40237).\nAntimicrobial properties\nPreliminary in vitro research shows that a crude preparation of devil's claw might have antiplasmodial activity (47120).\nAntioxidant properties\nPreliminary animal research shows that devil's claw might have antioxidant effects (47151, 47152); however, other research is conflicting (47140, 47119). Antioxidant effects similar to selegiline-induced responses were found in rats treated with a 53% ethanolic devil's claw dry extract (47151).\nCardiac and neuromuscular effects\nSome evidence suggests that devil's claw products might be cardioactive due to a harpagide constituent. Low doses seem to slow the heart rate and increase the strength of contraction. High doses seem to weaken heart contraction and coronary blood flow (8609). Animal research shows that devil's claw extract and isolated harpagoside appear to have antiarrhythmic effects (8609, 8610). Further, effects of the methanolic extract of devil's claw on smooth muscle may be due to a complex interaction of various constituents with the cholinergic receptor. While harpagoside antagonizes smooth muscle contractile responses to acetylcholine and BaCl2, harpagide increases the response at lower doses and antagonizes it at higher doses. This partial inhibition of BaCl2 experimentally may explain the protective effect of the extract to arrhythmias by interference of the mechanisms regulating influx of calcium into cells. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis (8609, 8610, 47136, 47139)."

            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Most studies have been small and lasted from a few weeks to 6 months, with usual doses of 50 mg daily (793, 1635, 2133, 3231, 4249, 4251, 4252, 4253, 4254, 4255, 9691)(9692, 10986, 12215, 12564, 14277, 21416, 88726, 90304, 99925). Some studies have also used oral DHEA with apparent safety for 12-24 months (2113, 6446, 10406, 11464, 12561, 15027, 88492). ...when used intravaginally and appropriately. Intravaginal ovules of DHEA 3.25 mg to 13 mg have been safely used for up to 12 weeks (21320, 21429, 21430). ...when used topically and appropriately. A DHEA cream 1% to 10% has been safely used for up to 12 months (4242, 21428).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses or long-term. There is concern that long-term use or use of amounts that cause higher than normal physiological DHEA levels might increase the risk of prostate cancer (2111, 12565), breast cancer (10370, 10401, 10403), or other hormone-sensitive cancers (6445). In some cases, 50-100 mg daily can produce slightly higher than normal physiological DHEA levels (4249, 4251).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using DHEA intravenously or intramuscularly.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally.

However, there is some concern that long-term oral use of DHEA may be linked to a greater risk for cancer.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Acne, headache, insomnia, mood changes, and nausea. In females, masculinization symptoms including deepening of the voice, increased size of genitals, irregular menses, oily skin, reduced breast size, and unnatural hair growth. In males, aggression, breast tenderness or enlargement (gynecomastia), urinary urgency, and testicular wasting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Possible increased risk for cardiovascular events and various types of cancer.\nCardiovascular\nIncidences of arrhythmia (21334, 47540), chest pain (21332, 21333), palpitations (21332, 21333, 88492), hypertension, and transient ischemic attacks (21353, 21354, 47300) have been reported. DHEA has also been found to decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (21344, 21345, 21346, 21347, 21348, 21349) and increase triglycerides (21334).\nless\nDermatologic\nAcne has been the most commonly reported adverse effect in human research, particularly in females (2113, 2114, 4242, 7614, 7559, 12561, 12574, 21346, 21351, 21354)(21355, 21356, 21357, 21358, 21360, 21361, 21362, 21363, 21364, 47300)(47355, 47409, 90304, 103185).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nVaginal atrophy. Intravaginal DHEA can reduce pain during intercourse and improve vaginal health in patients with this condition.\nClinical research shows that ovules or suppositories containing DHEA 0.25% to 1%, inserted vaginally once daily for 12 weeks, can reverse vaginal thinning, restore vaginal pH, and reduce pain during sexual intercourse by up to 15% when compared with placebo in patients with vaginal atrophy (21320, 21429, 21430, 94576). A specific vaginal insert containing DHEA 0.5% (Intrarosa, Endoceutics Inc.) is an FDA approved drug used for reducing pain during sexual intercourse in patients with vaginal atrophy (94573, 94576). Other clinical research shows that applying DHEA 10% cream (Diosynth) to the inner thighs daily for 12 months might improve vaginal atrophy by stimulating maturation of the vaginal epithelium in postmenopausal patients. It might also increase bone mineral density in these patients (4242).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAging skin. Oral and topical DHEA have been evaluated for treating aging skin, with promising results.\nSome clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 12 months increases epidermal thickness, sebum production, and skin hydration, and decreases facial skin pigmentation in elderly patients (6446). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying 1% DHEA daily for 4 months improves the appearance of paper-like skin when compared with placebo in postmenopausal patients. It also improves sebum production, skin wrinkling, and skin appearance when compared with baseline (21428).\nless\nDepression. Oral DHEA 30-500 mg daily for up to 8 weeks seems to improve symptoms of depression and dysthymia in patients with depression.\nCanadian clinical practice guidelines recommend DHEA as a third-line treatment for depression (95691). Most clinical research shows that taking DHEA 30-500 mg daily for around 6-8 weeks improves symptoms of depression and dysthymia when compared with placebo (3270, 3864, 3892, 4233, 21404, 21405). Additionally, a pooled analysis of these and 9 other clinical studies shows that DHEA can improve depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, although most of the trials evaluated in the analysis included patients without clinically diagnosed depression (104161). Other preliminary clinical research using lower doses of 5-20 mg daily over 3 weeks shows no improvement in depressive symptoms in psychotic patients (21406).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAging. Oral DHEA, taken for up to 2 years, does not appear to improve bone health, quality of life, or sexual function in older adults.\nClinical research shows that DHEA, taken as 75 mg daily in males or 50 mg daily in females, for 2 years does not seem to improve body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), insulin sensitivity, or quality of life in people aged 60 years or older who have low DHEA-S levels (15027). Additionally, a pooled analysis of clinical trials shows that taking DHEA 50-1600 mg daily for up to 2 years does not improve body composition, bone health, sexual function, lipid and glycemic parameters, or quality of life in elderly males (88434).\nless\nInfertility. Oral DHEA does not seem to improve pregnancy or live birth rates or reduce the risk of miscarriage in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology.\nMeta-analyses of up to 13 clinical trials in females undergoing assisted reproductive technology show that taking DHEA does not increase pregnancy or live birth rates or decrease miscarriage rates when compared with placebo or no treatment (113072, 115652). Furthermore, a large clinical study shows that pretreatment with DHEA in infertile females with poor ovarian response prior to IVF and embryo transfer does not improve the number of retrieved oocytes or the rates of clinical pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and cumulative live births when compared with placebo (111226). In another meta-analysis, although DHEA supplementation increased fertilization and pregnancy rates, there was no improvement in live birth rates (111227). Contrasting evidence from earlier meta-analyses shows that taking DHEA improves some measures of fertility outcomes including pregnancy and live birth rates (96819, 96821, 111227, 113072). However, these meta-analyses included observational research and/or lacked the inclusion of more recent, well-designed clinical trials. Individual clinical trials and observational research report conflicting effects of oral DHEA on measures of fertility outcomes including oocyte retrieval, pregnancy rates, or live birth rates in females undergoing assisted reproduction (21362, 21364, 21413, 21414, 21415, 21418, 88493, 88726, 90304, 96819)(96821, 99923, 103185). Doses of DHEA used in clinical research range from 50-75 mg daily (21362, 96819, 96821, 111227).\nless\nMuscle strength. Oral DHEA does not seem to improve muscle strength in adults.\nWhile some clinical research shows that adults who take DHEA have increased muscle strength when measured by grip strength, leg press, chest press, and other measures, most clinical evidence shows that DHEA provides no benefit to muscle strength in younger and older adults (1365, 10406, 17617, 21392, 21419, 21420, 21421, 47198).\nless\nPhysical performance. Oral DHEA does not seem to improve physical performance in elderly patients.\nMost clinical research and a meta-analysis show that older adults who take DHEA do not have increased physical function or performance as measured by oxygen uptake, duration of exercise, balance, and ability to rise from a chair (17617, 21420, 21421). However, one clinical study shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 6 months improves lower body strength and function by a small amount when compared with placebo in elderly frail females (21392). More research is needed to determine if DHEA is beneficial in specific populations.\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral DHEA does not improve cognitive function or prevent cognitive decline in most populations.\nIn the majority of clinical research, taking DHEA orally does not seem to improve cognitive function or decrease cognitive decline in healthy people over the age of 50 (3893, 11334, 14862, 21333, 21445), in peri- or post-menopausal women (6011, 21397, 21445), in patients with HIV (47435), or in young healthy adults when given as an acute dose (21399). However, preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 4 weeks may improve certain measures of visual spatial performance and memory when compared with placebo in middle aged and elderly females (21396, 21398).\nless\nSjogren syndrome. Oral DHEA does not appear to improve symptoms with this condition.\nClinical research shows that taking DHEA 50-200 mg daily for 4-12 months does not benefit symptoms of primary Sjogren syndrome when compared with placebo (21354, 21358, 21363, 21365).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAddison disease. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA up to 50 mg daily for up to 12 months improves symptoms of Addison disease, including reversing the loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and lean mass, but without improving cognitive function (8595, 21387). However, taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 12 weeks does not appear to improve cognitive or sexual function, body composition, or BMD, although it may improve mood and fatigue (7614, 21330, 21356).\nless\nAdrenal insufficiency. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.\nSome clinical research shows that taking low-dose DHEA, 20-50 mg daily, improves feelings of well-being, skin and hair, pubic hair growth, and sexuality in females with adrenal insufficiency or androgen deficiency due to hypopituitarism (3231, 8593, 17218, 21317, 21370, 21385). However, other clinical research shows that taking low-dose DHEA for 3-12 months has little to no effect on quality of life, body composition, physical performance, cardiac function, depression, anxiety, and sexual arousal in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (17218, 21351, 21357, 21360, 21386, 21388, 21389). Also, there is contradictory evidence about the effects of DHEA on plasma lipid levels in patients with adrenal insufficiency (21348, 21351).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral DHEA can improve sprint performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in female recreationally trained athletes shows that taking DHEA 100 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve sprint performance when compared with placebo (99925).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Observational research has found that low DHEA levels are linked to a greater risk for CVD, but it is unclear if supplementation with oral DHEA is beneficial.\nA meta-analysis of population research shows that patients with CVD and lower blood levels of DHEA-S have a worse overall prognosis when compared with patients with higher levels. Patients with the lowest levels have a 47% increased risk of future mortality events, including a 58% increased risk of fatal cardiovascular events. There was also a 42% increased risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events (96817). In elderly males, population research also shows that low serum levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) but not cerebrovascular disease (90303).\nless\nCervical dysplasia. It is unclear if intravaginal DHEA is beneficial in patients with cervical dysplasia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that DHEA 150 mg intravaginally for up to 6 months reverses dysplasia in 83% of treated females with low-grade cervical dysplasia when compared to baseline (21426). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with CFS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that oral DHEA 25-100 mg daily for 6 months improves symptoms of CFS by 8.5% to 26% when compared to baseline (7559). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with COPD.\nA small clinical study shows that taking DHEA 200 mg daily for 3 months increases walking distance and improves lung function in patients with COPD when compared to baseline (21395). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for reducing cocaine cravings.\nA small clinical study shows that taking DHEA 100 mg daily for 12 weeks, in addition to cognitive-behavioral group counseling, does not reduce cocaine craving when compared with counseling alone in cocaine-dependent participants (21411).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for inducing Crohn disease remission.\nA small clinical study shows that taking DHEA 200 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms in some patients with Crohn disease when compared to baseline. Remission occurred in 6 of 7 Crohn patients (21416). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral DHEA for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of DHEA for this purpose.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with ED.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA orally for 24 weeks improves erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall sexual satisfaction in patients with ED. DHEA seems to be beneficial for idiopathic ED or ED secondary to hypertension, but doesn't seem to provide benefit for ED related to diabetes or neurological disorders (793, 8596).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for reducing muscle damage from exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg twice daily for 5 days improves delayed-onset muscle soreness and reduces post-training blood creatinine kinase levels when compared with placebo in young males completing a 5-day exercise training program (88375).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for improving fibromyalgia symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 3 months does not reduce fibromyalgia symptoms when compared with placebo in postmenopausal patients with fibromyalgia (21355).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Small clinical studies suggest that oral DHEA may improve mental health and quality of life in patients with HIV/AIDS, but DHEA does not seem to improve CD4 counts or body composition.\nPopulation research shows that levels of DHEA seem to be lower in patients with more severe HIV/AIDS, suggesting that DHEA could be a marker for disease severity. Some evidence suggests that lower DHEA levels are associated with an increased risk of disease progression and AIDS (8598, 14278, 14279). Some clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50-500 mg daily for 2-4 months might improve mental health and quality of life when compared with placebo (3864, 8598, 14277, 21390). However, taking DHEA in doses up to 2.25 grams daily does not appear to improve CD4 counts, muscle mass, or bone mass when compared with placebo (3865, 14277, 21390).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral DHEA might reduce hot flashes and intravaginal DHEA might improve vaginal atrophy and sexual activity; however, oral DHEA does not seem to improve psychological symptoms associated with menopause.\nSome research shows that taking DHEA 10-25 mg daily for 12 months improves subjective vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, as well as psychological symptoms and sexuality (11464, 21417). Also, administering a daily ovule containing DHEA (Vaginorm, Recipharm) 3.5-13 mg intravaginally for 12 weeks appears to reverse vaginal atrophy and improve sexual activity in postmenopausal patients with vaginal atrophy (21442). However, other clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for up to 26 weeks does not improve mood, fatigue, cognition, sexual function, or sense of well-being in post- or peri-menopausal patients when compared with placebo (6011, 21361). Additionally, a pooled analysis of clinical research shows that DHEA taken orally does not improve psychological symptoms related to menopause (88492).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for reducing risk for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 6 months or 100 mg daily for 3 months decreases weight, abdominal fat, and blood pressure and reduces cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels when compared with placebo in overweight elderly patients (12215, 21350).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with myotonic dystrophy type I.\nTaking DHEA 100 or 400 mg daily for 12 weeks might not affect muscle strength in patients with myotonic dystrophy type I when compared with placebo (21334). However, intravenous DHEA-S 200 mg daily for 8 weeks appears to improve daily function, muscle strength, and heart function compared with baseline (21434). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for reducing body weight in patients who are obese or overweight.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 40 mg sublingually twice daily for 8 weeks, or 1600 mg by mouth for 28 days, does not affect body weight or body composition when compared with placebo in obese adults (21410, 21427). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50-100 mg daily for 3-12 months does not affect central adiposity in older individuals when compared with placebo (21349).\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with heroin withdrawal.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 100 mg daily as adjunct to standard therapy for 12 months does not improve drug withdrawal symptoms in heroin addicts when compared with standard therapy alone (21412).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with osteoporosis; any benefit may depend on individual patient characteristics.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of DHEA 50-100 mg daily for improved bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults with osteoporosis or osteopenia (12563, 12564, 21392), as well as the effectiveness of DHEA for improved BMD in females with anorexia nervosa (12562, 21393). One pooled analysis shows that DHEA does not improve BMD in postmenopausal patients (88492), while another shows that DHEA can increase hip BMD in healthy older females, but not males (103186). The reason for these discrepant findings is unclear, but may relate to different patient populations, durations of therapy, and DHEA doses assessed in the included studies. Additionally, most of the studies included in these analyses were of low quality and inadequate statistical power.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there has been interest in using oral DHEA for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of DHEA for this purpose.\nPartial androgen deficiency. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for symptom improvement in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 25 mg daily for one year might clinically improve mood, fatigue, and joint pain in older males with partial androgen deficiency when compared to baseline (21331). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50 mg twice daily for 4 months does not improve erectile or sexual function when compared with placebo in hypoandrogenic males (21424).\nless\nParturition. Intravenous DHEA before the onset of labor may shorten the time to labor onset and shorten labor duration.\nClinical research shows that intravenous DHEA-S 100 mg daily for 3 days, or given twice weekly until the onset of labor starting after 38 weeks of gestation, increases cervical ripening and shortens the time to onset of labor and the duration of labor when compared with a control in nulliparous women (21384, 21431). Also, intravenous DHEA 50-200 mg given multiple times until the onset of labor starting after 37 weeks of gestation appears to shorten the time to delivery in primiparous and multiparous women (21432, 21433). It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for this purpose.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with RA.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking oral DHEA 200 mg for 16 weeks does not reduce symptoms of RA in elderly patients (21422). However, other clinical research in a small number of premenopausal females with RA shows that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 12 weeks improves quality of life, but not disease activity, when compared with placebo (104159).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nSome research shows that taking DHEA orally improves both negative and positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. It may be more effective in females (9692). However, other clinical research shows no benefit (21423).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral or intravaginal DHEA is beneficial for improving sexual dysfunction in males or females.\nDHEA may be modestly beneficial in some postmenopausal patients with decreased libido or dyspareunia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 50-100 mg daily, or a single dose of DHEA 300 mg, improves sexual desire when compared to baseline (9906, 21443). Additional clinical research shows that use of intravaginal DHEA (Vaginorm, Recipharm) at concentrations of 0.25% to 1% daily for 12 weeks might improve sexual function when compared with placebo (47361). However, a pooled analysis shows that DHEA is not associated with improvements in libido or sexual function (88414, 88492).\n\nDHEA has also been evaluated in other patient populations. Small clinical studies show that taking DHEA doesn't seem to influence response to sexual stimuli in sexually functional premenopausal women (8594) or improve libido in individuals age 40-70 years (21449). Preliminary clinical research in males with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) shows that taking DHEA 50 mg twice daily for 6 weeks does not improve erectile or sexual function when compared with placebo (88414). In adults with midlife-onset or HIV-associated depression, preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHEA 90-500 mg daily for 3-8 weeks may improve sexual function and libido when compared with placebo (3864, 21405).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most small clinical studies suggest that oral DHEA may modestly improve symptoms in patients with SLE, but some conflicting research exists.\nSome clinical research shows that taking DHEA has little to no effect on disease activity in patients with mild to moderate SLE (21425, 21447). However, small clinical studies and a meta-analysis of these studies show that taking DHEA in conjunction with conventional treatment may help improve frequency of flare-ups, muscle ache, oral ulcers, and quality of life, reduce corticosteroid doses needed (2113, 2114, 2136, 6068, 6447, 12561, 12574, 21346, 21447), and improve bone mineral density (6068, 6097, 6447, 21394).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral DHEA is beneficial for inducing ulcerative colitis remission.\nA small clinical study shows that taking DHEA 200 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of ulcerative colitis when compared to baseline in some patients with ulcerative colitis. Remission occurred in 6 of 13 ulcerative colitis patients (21416). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate DHEA for these uses.",

It was reported that only half of the products met the claims (12569, 12570).\n\nDHEA is a synthetic product that can be manufactured from natural sources such as soy and wild yam (which explains its ability to be marketed as a dietary supplement). Constituents, such as diosgenin, are converted in the laboratory to DHEA. However, diosgenin from ingested wild yam or soy cannot be converted to DHEA in the human body, as has been reported. Neither soy nor wild yam taken orally has any effect on DHEA levels in humans (2112, 7617, 12571). People interested in taking DHEA should avoid wild yam and soy products labeled as \"natural DHEA.\"",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with DHEA.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe bioavailability of oral DHEA is low (47515). Following oral administration, DHEA is rapidly converted to DHEA-S and androgens and estrogens (4253, 6010, 21324, 47273, 47348, 99924). The absorption following intramuscular injection of DHEA is reportedly slower (47456). In humans, topical DHEA gel (50 mg daily for five days) has been shown to be rapidly absorbed following application, with DHEA levels increasing 77% after three doses (47214). Five weeks after terminating, DHEA and DHEA-S levels were reportedly lower or at baseline levels. Androstenedione levels, however, increased at the beginning and continued to increase (more than twofold) after five weeks. Vaginal DHEA administration has been shown to increase DHEA, but not DHEA-S or testosterone levels (47505).\nDistribution\nDHEA and DHEA-S are widely distributed in the body. DHEA concentrations are highest in the brain, followed by the plasma, spleen, kidneys, and liver (47216). In human research, DHEA and DHEA-S were primarily bound to albumin (7618, 47516). In humans, 27 times higher concentrations of DHEA were found in the testes compared to serum (47411). In females, free DHEA was reportedly 4-10 times higher in adipose tissue than in serum (47412).\nMetabolism\nDHEA and its main metabolite, DHEA-S, are converted to various active metabolites including androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, and estrone (2133, 7514, 10986, 12564, 15027, 21321, 21323, 21324, 21325, 21326)(21327, 21328, 21330, 21331, 47254, 47261, 47526, 47546, 47547, 99924). Other metabolites including 16alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, and 7-oxo-DHEA have also been identified in humans and rats (47217).\n\nLaboratory research suggests that hydroxylation of DHEA is primarily mediated by CYP3A (47268). Other isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of DHEA include CYP1A, CYP2D, and CYP2E1 (47217, 47268, 47423).\nExcretion\nDHEA and its metabolites are primarily excreted in urine (8592, 47270, 47516, 99924). The elimination half-life of DHEA ranges from 15 minutes to 3 hours, while the elimination half-life of DHEA-S is approximately 7-24 hours (7618, 8592, 90314). The metabolic clearance rate for DHEA in pregnant women is reportedly higher (2.5-fold) compared to that of non-pregnant women (47466).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an endogenous hormone predominantly synthesized in the adrenal glands, as well as in the ovaries and testes to a lesser extent, in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (4248, 47190, 47459, 47507, 47525, 47564). DHEA is synthesized by a sequence of steps starting from cholesterol (via CYP11A1) to pregnenolone (via 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-hydroxylase [CYP17A1]) (47359). DHEA is then converted to androstenedione (via enzyme 3B hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [3BHSD]), a precursor to testosterone. DHEA has been termed \"the mother steroid\" because it serves as a precursor in the synthesis of many other hormones, including testosterone and estrogens (47190, 47319, 47453, 47486, 47527, 47564, 47565, 99924). However, although DHEA is a precursor to other hormones, it doesn't have direct estrogenic or androgenic activity (12559). In peripheral and adrenal tissues, DHEA and sulfated DHEA (DHEA-S) are interconverted by sulfotransferase and sulfatase enzymes (7618, 47458, 47507). Although this interconversion is well documented, some researchers have challenged this concept (47284).\n\nNatural levels of DHEA decrease with age, but with individual variability (6014, 47190, 47224, 47231, 47259, 47272, 47301, 47401, 47410, 47461)(47482, 47513, 47526). Levels tend to peak between the ages of 20 and 30 (12215. 47210, 47393, 47443, 47461, 47507). Subsequently, a gradual decline in DHEA and DHEA-S levels occurs (47224, 47259, 47272, 47301, 47401, 47410, 47482, 47513, 47526). However, in about one-third of the population, DHEA-S levels increase with age (4248, 6013, 6014, 8597).\n\nStudies have also shown that DHEA and DHEA-S levels also vary with gender, race, ethnicity, and body mass (6014, 47228, 47264, 47449, 47468, 47528). Plasma DHEA concentrations are reportedly higher in women than in men under the age of 50 years, with DHEA-S concentrations being similar (47468, 47449). Conversely, in men and women above 50 years of age, plasma DHEA concentrations were found to be similar, but DHEA-S concentrations were reportedly lower in women than in men. Also, prospective research has shown that DHEA-S levels are 3.8% lower for each kilogram per m2 of body mass index (BMI), indicated decreased levels with increased BMI (47208).\n\nIn humans, high DHEA and/or DHEA-S levels have been associated with acne (47399), Cushing disease (47226), gynecomastia (47455), hyperandrogenism (nonclassical steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency) (47225), hyperthyroidism (47460), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (47223, 47238, 47413, 47465), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (47296, 47303, 47310, 47349, 47375), pre-eclampsia (47282), and psychosis (47253). Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with adrenal insufficiency (47285, 88395), AIDS (3867, 47487), aging (47239, 47301), Alzheimer disease (12296, 12297, 47201, 47204, 47215, 47263, 47372, 47506, 47508), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (47260, 47307, 47405), arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis) (47211, 47492, 47496, 47542), asthma (47463), burns (47267), cardiovascular disease (47317, 47328, 47333, 47356, 47381, 47386, 47484, 47531, 47535), chronic fatigue syndrome (7558), depression (10876, 47229), diabetes and hyperinsulinemia (21324, 47440, 47442, 47478, 47488, 47489, 47543), gout (47566), Huntington disease (47497, 47567), hypothyroidism (47460), leprosy (47262), lipidodystrophy (8598), liver diseases (47202), metabolic syndrome (47381), multiple sclerosis (47200), myotonic dystrophy (47192), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (47316, 47406), primary biliary cirrhosis (47305, 47365), Sjögren syndrome (47265, 47343, 47353, 47422), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (47237, 47338, 47477), T cell leukemia (adult) (47512), and urticaria (47336). Diminished levels of serum DHEA-S may also be associated with various measures of disease-related psychological distress, including anxious traits (negatively associated), depression (negatively associated), and sense of coherence (positively associated), as demonstrated in patients with urticaria (47335).\nAdrenal insufficiency effects\nIn women with adrenal insufficiency, DHEA has been shown to normalize androgen levels (21389, 47269, 47285), promote pubic hair growth (in young girls) (9691, 21370), and improve quality of life (21317, 21370), although some human research has demonstrated a lack of effect on quality of life (21351).\nAntiaging effects\nResearchers have suggested that replacing DHEA by supplementation might prevent some of the diseases and conditions associated with aging (6446). However, people whose DHEA-S levels increase with age don't seem to age any differently than people with declining DHEA-S levels. There does not appear to be an association between prematurely low DHEA-S levels and increased risk for diseases commonly seen with old age (6013, 6014, 8597).\nAntiarthritic effects\nAccording to laboratory research, there is a link between DHEA levels and effects (degenerative and protective) on articular cartilage (47211, 47241, 47274, 47279, 47521, 47542, 47548). Low levels of DHEA and DHEA-S have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (47211, 47241, 47279, 47521, 47542, 47548). According to research in premenopausal women, basal levels of DHEA-S may serve as a marker for disease activity (47244). However, the research lacks consistency (47193), and only a weak relationship has been noted between DHEA and DHEA-S levels and osteoarthritis (47323, 47492). In addition, it is also unclear whether DHEA-S levels correlate with disease activity and severity (47496, 47542).\nAntiasthma effects\nIn adult asthmatic patients treated or not treated with steroids, decreased levels of DHEA-S were noted vs. nonasthmatic patients (47463). However, a relationship was lacking between DHEA-S levels and rhinitis or asthma in children (47532). According to laboratory research, DHEA may exert beneficial effects in patients with asthma due to its immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects. In human and animal asthmatic cells, DHEA suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines (T-helper 1 [Th1] and Th2-associated cytokines [interleukin [IL-8] and IL-6]) and chemokines (chemokine ligand [CCL]11 and CCL24) (47350, 47425).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn men, DHEA co-administered with insulin increased the rate of metabolic clearance of DHEA (47480, 47519); however, in women, it was unchanged (47480). In obese women and elderly and middle-aged patients, DHEA and DHEA-S supplementation improved insulin sensitivity (4249, 4250, 10985, 12215, 21350, 21401, 47424); however, findings have been inconsistent, with some studies demonstrating a lack of effect on insulin action and insulin sensitivity (21351, 21410, 107788). In other human research, DHEA supplementation reduced levels of insulin, fasting insulin resistance index, glucose (21325, 21350) and T lymphocyte binding (4249). One meta-analysis in patients with various health conditions suggests that DHEA supplementation reduces plasma fasting glucose, with greater reductions observed in patients 60 years or older, or with doses of 50 mg or less or treatment durations of 12 weeks or less (107788). DHEA-S has also decreased levels of leptin (21350), adiponectin (21350), and ghrelin (21350), although these effects have been inconsistent. Other research has found no effects on adiponectin and leptin (107791).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human and laboratory research, DHEA has demonstrated both antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects (7617, 47195, 47354, 47373).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, DHEA and DHEA-S demonstrated antiviral activity against adenovirus (47391), Trichomonas vaginalis (47385), Junin virus (47330), vesicular stomatitis virus (47339), coxsackievirus B4 (47448), and herpes simplex type 2 virus (HSV-2) (47448). Experts have noted that DHEA may protect against stress-induced glucocorticoid immune system suppression, which may result in viral infection (47448).\n\nLow serum DHEA levels in people with HIV seem to be predictors of disease progression to AIDS (8598, 14278, 14279). DHEA has been used for HIV disease because of reports of modest antiviral effects, possible immunomodulating effects, and findings that DHEA decreases with declining CD4 lymphocyte counts (3865, 3866, 3867); however, DHEA does not seem to affect CD4 counts in doses up to 2.25 grams/day (3865, 14277).\nBone effects\nAlthough conflicting results exist (47495), most research shows a positive correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and serum DHEA-S levels in humans, particularly in postmenopausal women (47243, 47280, 47286, 47377, 47438, 47500, 47520). The androgenic and estrogenic effects of DHEA may play a role in bone metabolism (4242, 47222, 47563). In aging adults, DHEA supplementation (alone or co-administered with vitamin D and calcium) has been shown to increase BMD (15027, 21326, 21327, 21332, 21353, 21387, 47437).\n\nLow levels of DHEA and DHEA-S have been associated with certain conditions characterized by low bone mineral density, including Addison disease (47444), anorexia nervosa (12562), or SLE. In anorexic women, co-administration of DHEA and oral contraceptives preserved both spinal and whole-body BMD (47433). The effects of DHEA on bone formation in SLE patients have been attributed to the androgenic properties of DHEA (6447); however, the reduction in corticosteroid use with DHEA supplementation might also be responsible for this effect. In women with adrenal insufficiency, DHEA does not seem to significantly affect measures of body composition including weight and bone mineral composition. The minor increase in osteocalcin in these patients does not appear to be clinically significant (9601).\n\nDHEA levels do not appear to correlate with disease severity in patients with osteoporosis (47454). However, in older adults with steroid-induced osteoporosis, DHEA supplementation has been shown to increase bone formation markers (osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and decrease bone resorption markers (the urinary hydroxyproline:creatinine ratio) (4242, 12562, 47437). DHEA may protect against osteoporosis by increasing serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (4251, 47437).\n\nHowever, some human research has demonstrated a lack of DHEA treatment effect on BMD, bone mineral content, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, cortisol, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary deoxypyridinoline cross-links, calcium, and creatinine (21393). In older men, there was a lack of change in bone density or markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin and C-terminal peptide of type I collagen) (6446, 10951).\nCardiovascular effects\nDHEA-S levels are decreased in men with congestive heart failure (CHF), in proportion to its severity, possibly due to the effects of oxidative stress on electron transport required for DHEA synthesis (5871). Also, population research suggests that low levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in elderly men (90303).\n\nResearch suggests that DHEA supplementation might have beneficial effects on microvascular circulation and cardiovascular risk. Supplemental DHEA seems to inhibit synthesis of thromboxane A2 in platelets, decrease augmentation index, increase serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and nitric oxide synthesis (8592, 19109, 19127, 21352). DHEA supplementation also appears to reduce plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen. Elevated levels of these proteins are risk factors for thrombosis and atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction (7616). Estrogenic activity, together with nitric oxide release, may also be responsible for an antiatherosclerotic effect of DHEA observed in animal models (5869). Also, DHEA-S appears to decrease both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in humans (21350). In humans, DHEA-S has been found to have digitalis-like activity, similar to that of digitalis-like factors (47451, 47452). Some research also suggests DHEA might have a beneficial on lipid levels in postmenopausal women (10985). In animals, DHEA attenuates depressed cardiac and hepatic function secondary to trauma hemorrhage in male rats, possibly due to estrogenic activity (6101).\nCognitive effects\nIn the brain, DHEA is concentrated in the limbic regions and may function as an excitatory neuroregulator, antagonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission (5870, 47189, 47289, 47369, 47470, 47476, 47507). However, a correlation between DHEA-S levels and cognitive status or cognitive decline in elderly men has not been demonstrated (5874). Some studies have found decreased levels of DHEA in patients with dementia, while others have not (14862). In human research, DHEA supplementation does not appear to affect most measures of short-term memory and recall (21397, 21398, 47435), although it may improve measures related to visual spatial performance (21398).\nFertility effects\nDHEA is of interest for improving fertility in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (96819, 96821, 111226, 111227, 113072, 115652). Human research shows that taking DHEA increases levels of hypoxic inducible factor-1 but not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in follicular fluid, reduces mean stimulation span, and improves the retrieval rate of mature oocytes (21415). DHEA has also increased median antral follicle count and total ovarian volume when compared to control at 12 and 20 weeks post-supplementation, respectively, but with no effect on follicle size (21364). Researchers theorize that DHEA is converted into androstenedione and estrone in the ovarian follicle and influences ovarian follicular growth by acting as a metabolic precursor for steroid production and a ligand for androgen receptor II (111226).\nHepatic effects\nIn rats and rainbow trout, DHEA induced hepatocarcinogenesis, particularly with long-term use (47248, 47251, 47252, 47481, 47504, 47524, 47534). In these studies, various mechanisms underlying this tumor-promoting effect have been described: peroxisome proliferation (47251, 47252, 47481, 47524), basophilic cell focus (BCF) growth stimulation (47248), and DNA damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during DHEA treatment (47504). Conversely, other animal research has reported anticancer activity in the liver (47293, 47404, 47445, 47472, 47498).\nHormonal effects\nResearchers speculate that DHEA might have similar therapeutic benefits to estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In a low-estrogen environment such as menopause, DHEA has estrogenic effects. Some of the effects in postmenopausal women are similar to HRT including increasing estradiol, estrone, osteocalcin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); however, unlike HRT, DHEA also increases androstenedione and testosterone (7327, 11464, 21351, 21352, 21397, 21398, 21417, 88415, 104162, 107790). Conversion to estrogen doesn't seem to be necessary for its estrogenic activity. These changes also occur in younger females (99924, 99925). DHEA also appears to decrease levels of leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin (21350). However, findings have been inconsistent, with some research suggesting DHEA has no effect on leptin and adiponectin levels (107791).\n\nDHEA-S stimulates the growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. It can overcome the estrogen receptor blocking activity of drugs such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex) and fulvestrant (Faslodex). Some researchers think controlling DHEA-S serum levels may be useful in the treatment of breast cancer (10370).\nImmune effects\nDHEA may have a stimulatory effect on immune function (47213, 47257, 47275, 47318, 47416, 47448, 47485, 47493, 47494, 47517). In aged mice, co-administration of DHEA with influenza vaccine enhanced immunization (47499, 47503). In other animal research, low doses of DHEA, co-administered with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), reduced the development of airway hypersensitivity; however, high doses of DHEA reduced the efficacy of BCG (21316). In elderly subjects, the co-administration of DHEA and influenza vaccine (50 mg of DHEA daily for 4 days, starting 2 days before vaccination) decreased immune response (against H1N1 and H3N2) (47529). However, in other human research, DHEA-S administration (an oral, two-day dose or a single subcutaneous injection) prior to influenza vaccine enhanced immune response (2132, 47501).\nInflammatory effects\nIn human research, DHEA upregulated various parameters involved in the NF-kappaB inflammation pathway, including the percent change of activated NF-kappaB, p105, p65, p65 protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-1beta RNA, between fasting and glucose-challenged states (47430). Other human research has demonstrated favorable changes in the serum concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-6 following DHEA supplementation (21352).\nLipid effects\nIn human research, DHEA and DHEA-S supplementation reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (21325, 21349, 21350, 21351, 21352, 47447). However, some available human studies have reported a decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL; \"good\") cholesterol levels and an increase in triglycerides (8593, 21334, 21344, 21345, 21346, 21347, 21348, 21349, 47469). In human fetal plasma, an inverse correlation exists between the concentrations of DHEA-S and LDL, although this was lacking with HDL or very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. It was suggested that the concentration of LDL in fetal plasma is controlled by the rate of utilization of LDL by the fetal adrenal gland for steroidogenesis (47467).\nMetabolic effects\nSome DHEA proponents suggest that DHEA supplements might be useful for metabolic syndrome. With aging, abdominal fat increases, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality (12559). Abdominal obesity increases the risk for insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis (12251). Although inactivity and overeating contribute to abdominal fat accumulation with aging, metabolic changes such as the decline in DHEA levels may also play a role. Obesity is associated with lower plasma free DHEA levels, but the relationship between DHEA-S levels and obesity are less clear; studies are conflicting (12559).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research in elderly patients shows that DHEA may reverse age-related increases in fat mass and decreases in lean body mass (2133, 4251, 12564, 47514, 47562). Also, DHEA supplementation appears to reduce total and abdominal fat in elderly patients (12215, 47447, 47551, 47562), as well as reduce body weight in postmenopausal patients (21350) and those with adrenal failure (21389). However, in some studies, evidence of benefit was lacking (1365, 4255, 9694, 21349, 21386, 21389, 21393, 21410, 47198)(47364, 47562). In obese women, DHEA-S supplementation appears to improve plasma fatty acid profile, including decreased levels of total fatty acids and increased levels of certain n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), although results were inconsistent among individual fatty acids (21350).\n\nThe mechanism of DHEA in body fat distribution is not well understood. As a precursor to androgens and estrogens DHEA might help regulate adipocyte physiology and the accumulation of adipose tissue (47387). DHEA activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, which seems to inhibit adipocyte differentiation into mature fat cells. PPAR-alpha may also upregulate the genetic expression of enzymes that regulate lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes, as well as suppressing enzymes that cause adipogenesis (12559, 12560). DHEA and DHEA-S may also increase the number of beta-adrenoreceptors in cells, which may stimulate lipolysis (47471). Also, animal research suggests that DHEA may enhance thermogenesis by activating thermogenic enzymes (ergosteroids) and thyroid hormones (47523).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nDHEA has demonstrated variable effects on muscle strength in human research. In a review, DHEA lacked an effect on handgrip strength, chest press strength, leg press strength, knee extensor and flexor strength, VO2peak, and total duration of exercise and maximum workload (10406, 17617). However, some human research has shown beneficial increases in chest press strength, leg press strength, and knee extensor and flexor strength following DHEA supplementation (17617).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn mice models of Alzheimer disease, DHEA protected the growth and survival of hypoplastic neurites in newborn neurons but did not inhibit the overproliferation of progenitor cells (47434).\nNociceptive effects\nIn a review, DHEA regulated nociception through complex mechanisms. Acute DHEA administration appeared to exert a biphasic modulatory effect: rapidly stimulating a pronociceptive effect and a delayed antinociceptive effect. Chronic administration of DHEA increased basal nociceptive thresholds, reportedly due to analgesic effects generated by testosterone (47395).\nOcular effects\nHigh levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) have been associated with a reduced risk of cataract (47266). However, it is not clear if DHEA-S supplementation would have beneficial effects.\nOpioid receptor effects\nIn animals, naltrexone blocked the antianxiety and antidepressant effects of DHEA via mu-receptor blocking activity (47431).\nPulmonary effects\nIn human research, DHEA increased lung capacity for diffusing carbon monoxide, decreased mean arterial pulmonary pressure, and reduced vascular pulmonary resistance (21395).\nRadiation effects\nIn human H4 neuroglioma cells, pretreatment with DHEA reduced Akt phosphorylation induced by gamma-ray irradiation (47347). DHEA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. DHEA suppressed Akt phosphorylation through down regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).\nSexuality effects\nIn human research, DHEA increased the frequency of sexual intercourse and subjective sexuality ratings on the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (MFSQ) of postmenopausal women (21417). However, research in premenopausal women has demonstrated a lack of effect on subjective sexual arousal ratings and vaginal blood flow response following exposure to erotic stimuli (8594).\nSkin effects\nIn postmenopausal women, topical DHEA improved signs of skin aging, as evidenced by increased sebum (which tends to decrease with age) and improved skin brightness (21428). The effects of DHEA in the skin may occur by stimulating the synthesis of collagen and inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation (47345). In human keratinocytes, DHEA inhibited apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2 proteins and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (47358).\nStress effects\nIn humans, DHEA, DHEA-S, and cortisol levels, as well as DHEA:cortisol, DHEA-S:cortisol, and testosterone:cortisol concentration ratios, increased following exposure to acute stress (47426). The DHEA-S:cortisol ratio indicated the degree to which an individual is protected against the negative effects of stress (47271, 47340). Human research suggests DHEA supplementation may lower serum cortisol levels (107791).\nThyroid effects\nIn animals, DHEA treatment altered thyroid hormone status (47549). In rats, increased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were noted following DHEA-S administration, particularly after repeated cold exposure (47351, 47378, 47382). In healthy males, transdermal 7-oxo-DHEA resulted in a slight and temporary elevation in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and T4 (47287). Research in elderly males with autoimmune thyroiditis, subclinical hypothyroidism, and low DHEA-S levels suggests that taking DHEA 50 mg daily for 6 months may increase thyroid stimulating function and secretory capacity. DHEA also decreased thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibody titers (107789). Similarly, in postmenopausal adults, high oral doses of DHEA (1600 mg daily) decreased thyroglobulin concentrations (21324).\nVaginal effects\nIn postmenopausal adults, intravaginal administration of DHEA reduced signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy (21320, 21429, 21430, 47334). In the vaginal epithelium of postmenopausal adults, treatment with DHEA increased the maturation index, as evidenced by reduced parabasal cells and increased superficial cells (21430, 47334). Increased vaginal pH was also reported (21430, 47334).\nVascular effects\nIn laboratory research, DHEA increased endothelial cell proliferation and improved endothelial function (47242, 47276, 47341). In cultured human endothelial cells, DHEA increased production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (47242). Additionally, DHEA increased proliferation by increasing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity in bovine endothelial cells. In other research in bovine endothelial cells, DHEA was found to bind to a G protein-coupled receptor on the plasma membrane. Further laboratory research has found that treatment of vascular endothelial cells with DHEA increases phosphorylation of fork-head transcription factor FoxO1 through phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanisms (47341). Nitric oxide (a vasodilator) was then produced through the PI3-kinase mechanism. DHEA also enhanced secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1, a vasoconstrictor) via MAPK-dependent pathways.\n\nAccording to laboratory research, DHEA may target the CHD40/CD40 ligand (CD40 L) system, which may be beneficial against atherosclerosis (47346). DHEA reduced the impact of interferon-gamma on CD40 and CD40 L expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (47346). Additionally, DHEA inhibited ERK1/2 activation by interferon-gamma. In humans, however, DHEA lacked improvement in vascular function or any cardiovascular parameters through direct or improved endothelial function (21360).\n\nDHEA demonstrated beneficial effects in vascular remodeling, as evidenced by reduced cell proliferation and selective induction of apoptosis in proliferating cells (47376). Additionally, DHEA inhibited AKT, which thereby activated GSK-3beta. As a result, intracellular calcium (Ca2+) decreased and inhibited activation of NFATc1 and prevented the suppression of caspases by potassium. The disruption caused by DHEA to this positive feedback loop suggests that it may be able to reverse vascular remodeling.\n\nIn vitro, DHEA acted as a vasodilator (47194, 47362, 47475). In pregnant women, DHEA-S exerted vasodilatory effects and increased blood flow to the ophthalmic artery (47475)."

    "Diacylglycerol": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Diacylglycerol is a compound found naturally in triglyceride-based fats and oils in amounts ranging from 1% to 10% of the oil (99926, 99930, 99931, 99934). Oils that are rich in diacylglycerol, over 80% of the oil, have been synthesized for health-related uses (99929, 99934). These oils taste and look like regular triglyceride-based fats and oils, and can be used as cooking oil (99928). Diacylglycerol is also used as an emulsifier, stabilizer, thickener, and texturizer.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Diacylglycerol is considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (99934). In clinical trials, diacylglycerol has been used orally in doses of up to 40 grams daily or ad libitum as a cooking oil for up to 12 months (9142, 9143, 9144, 15584, 99927, 99928, 99929, 99930).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in the amounts found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of diacylglycerol when used in larger amounts during pregnancy and lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, diacylglycerol is well tolerated.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, diacylglycerol can cause mild gastrointestinal complaints. However, these occur no more frequently than when regular triglyceride oil is consumed (9142).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nObesity. Most clinical research shows that oral diacylglycerol improves body weight and/or body composition in overweight or obese individuals.\nAlthough diacylglycerol has shown benefit for improving weight loss in adults with obesity when compared to baseline, it is unclear if diacylglycerol leads to greater improvements than other fats made from triglycerides. Any additional weight loss appears to be no more than about 1% over periods of 3-12 months. Also, diacylglycerol is unlikely to be beneficial in people who are already on a calorie-reduced diet (9142, 9144, 99928, 99930, 99932, 99933). One small study in overweight males and overweight, postmenopausal females shows that taking a type of diacylglycerol rich in alpha-linolenic acid 2.5 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces visceral fat by approximately 8 cm when compared with an alpha-linolenic acid-rich triglyceride oil. There were also small improvements in body weight and body mass index, but not waist circumference. Due to the small amounts of diacylglycerol used in the study, it is unclear whether these modest effects can be attributed to diacylglycerol (99932).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. Most clinical research suggests that oral diacylglycerol does not improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, it may modestly reduce triglyceride levels in some people.\nClinical research from small studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking diacylglycerol does not improve fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with triglyceride oils (9143, 15581, 99927, 99929, 99933). One small study shows that using diacylglycerol 23 grams daily while cooking for 120 days improves measures of insulin resistance when compared with a triglyceride oil. However, these changes were limited to individuals with normal body weight, and another clinical study did not replicate this finding (99929, 99933).\n\nTaking diacylglycerol might lower triglyceride levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. When used to replace triglyceride fats, diacylglycerol 10 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting triglyceride levels by 26% to 40% in patients with type 2 diabetes (9143, 15581). However, other research shows that taking as much as 50 grams daily does not reduce postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in patients with insulin resistance (99927, 99929).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral diacylglycerol can slow the progression of nephropathy in adults with diabetes.\nA very small clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and stage 4 diabetic nephropathy shows that taking diacylglycerol 10 grams daily for up to 6 months appears to slow the progression of kidney disease when compared to baseline (15581). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a statistical comparison to the control group.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. Research on the use of oral diacylglycerol for reducing triglyceride levels is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of seven randomized clinical trials of 298 people shows that taking diacylglycerol does not reduce fasting levels of triglycerides (99934). Also, more recent preliminary clinical research in adults with hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking diacylglycerol 40 grams daily for 4 weeks or ad libitum for one year does not reduce fasting triglyceride levels (99928, 99930). However, two small studies of people with hypertriglyceridemia associated with type 2 diabetes shows that taking diacylglycerol 10 grams daily for 3 months reduces fasting triglyceride levels by up to 40% (9143, 15581, 99934).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate diacylglycerol for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDiacylglycerol is most often used at a dose of 10-20 grams daily for up to 1 year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThe composition of diacylglycerol oil varies by manufacturer. Diacylglycerol oils have been prepared from triglyceride plant oils, including soybean and rapeseed oil, using a lipase to remove one of the fatty acids from triglyceride (99927, 99931). In some studies, diacylglycerol oil provided by Kao Corporation was described as 86.1% diacylglycerol, comprised of 53.6% linoleic acid and 32.9% oleic acid (99929, 99933). In other studies, the oil was described as 85% diacylglycerol, providing a 3:7 ratio of 1,2-diacylglycerol to 1,3-diacylglycerol, and comprised of 48% linoleic acid and 38% oleic acid (99928, 99931).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn the intestine, diacylglycerols are readily hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerols and fatty acids (9146). The monoacylglycerol produced from diacylglycerol is poorly re-esterified into a triglyceride and is absorbed directly into the blood instead of via assembly into chylomicrons. It might also be converted into triglycerides in the intestinal mucosa at a slower rate (9146, 15583, 99926).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDiacylglycerol is a minor component of various edible oils and fats, including soybean, corn, safflower, olive, and cottonseed oils at levels of 1% to 10% (99926, 99933). It is synthesized commercially by enzyme-catalyzed esterification of glycerol with fatty acids from oils such as canola, soybean, corn, and olive oil to produce a mixture containing at least 80% diacylglycerols, including 1,3-diacylglycerol and 1,2-diacylglycerol. The main fatty acid constituents of diacylglycerol are oleic, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acids (9142, 99931).\nAntidiabetic effects\nWhen diacylglycerol is used in place of triglycerides in meals, some research shows that the postprandial rise in serum insulin levels is lower (15580, 15582, 99926, 99929). However, not all research agrees, and any improvement in insulin resistance might be limited to individuals with normal body weight (99927, 99933).\nTriglyceride effects\nSome research suggests that taking diacylglycerol reduces levels of triglycerides in the blood. Most research suggests that taking diacylglycerol reduces postprandial levels of serum triglycerides, but not fasting triglycerides (99934, 99935). During digestion, although diacylglycerol oils contain approximately the same number of calories as triglyceride oils, and seem to be digested to the same extent, the structural differences in diacylglycerol possibly result in differences in metabolism. In the intestine, diacylglycerols are readily hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerols and fatty acids (9146). The monoacylglycerol produced from diacylglycerol is poorly re-esterified into triglycerides, and is not assembled into chylomicrons (9146, 15583). Thus, postprandial triglyceride levels have been suggested to rise more in serum after ingestion of common triglyceride fats and oils than after ingestion of diacylglycerol oils. Although some individual studies disagree, a meta-analysis of human research shows that postprandial triglyceride levels are lower for up to 6 hours after intake of diacylglycerol when compared with triglyceride fats (9142, 9145, 99927, 99929, 99935). Also, postprandial levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) are reduced even in healthy individuals (99926). However, taking diacylglycerol does not seem to reduce fasting levels of triglycerides in the blood, except possibly in individuals with type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia (99934).\nWeight loss effects\nTaking diacylglycerol has been shown to result in a small amount of weight loss in human research (9142, 9144, 99928, 99930, 99932, 99933). Possible mechanisms of action include increased postprandial fat oxidation, thermogenesis, and energy expenditure (15582, 99926). In human research, taking diacylglycerol increased levels of serotonin, involved in thermogenesis and energy expenditure (99926). However, while consuming diacylglycerol might increase fat oxidation, it does not increase carbohydrate or protein oxidation or total energy expenditure. Additionally, it does not seem to affect hunger or satiety (99930, 99931)."

The term diatomaceous earth is commonly used as an alternative name to diatomite, although the latter term usually refers to the compacted rock and the former to the sediment. The silica in the diatomaceous earth comes from the fossilized amorphous silica cell walls of specific aquatic algae, known as diatoms. Commercial deposits are generally from freshwater lake deposits from 100 thousand to several million years ago. Deposits are found worldwide (91492, 91497).",

Due to the delusional belief of a chronic cutaneous parasite infestation, the woman used diatomaceous earth topically as an insecticide. Examination revealed erosions and ulcerations on the skin on her trunk and extremities, but these were absent on hard to reach areas of the body. A biopsy of a papule revealed a crust of neutrophils and extravasated erythrocytes. The presence of diatomaceous earth was determined using microscopic magnification (91499).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn one case report. exposure to processed diatomaceous earth was associated with the development of systemic sclerosis (91494).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen mined or used for industrial purposes, diatomaceous earth appears to increase the risk of lung cancer and non-malignant respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to its constituent crystalline silica. However, compared to other forms of silica, the crystalline silica content of unprocessed diatomaceous earth, used topically or orally medicinally, is quite low and therefore this source does not appear to be as toxic as other sources of silica (26630, 91493, 91496, 91498).\nless",

Diatomaceous earth particle range from a size of less than one micron to greater than 1 mm (91499).\nInsecticidal and parasidal effects\nDiatomaceous earth is commonly used on foods, objects, and skin as an insecticide. Due to its absorptive properties, diatomaceous earth acts as a desiccant resulting in dehydration and death of the organism. It has been used alone or in combination with other ingredients for bed bugs, ticks, and grain beetles (91499, 92192). In animal research, diatomaceous earth reduces internal parasite load when given orally, and external mite load when dusted topically on the animal (92191).\nWater purification effects\nDiatomaceous earth is commonly used to purify water. This is due to its porous, chemically inert nature with high permeability. Heavy metals may also need to be removed using diatomaceous earth.

Noncompartmental half-lives for monohydroxylated metabolites and their conjugates were 9-10 hours (108443).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDiindolylmethane is a major active metabolite of indole-3-carbinol (7664), a constituent of cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli. In stomach acid, indole-3-carbinol is unstable and readily converts to a variety of compounds, including diindolylmethane (7669). A typical diet provides 20-120 mg of indole-3-carbinol per day. Approximately 10% to 20% is converted to diindolylmethane, providing 2-24 mg daily (7170, 7176, 7664).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory research shows that diindolylmethane has anti-inflammatory effects. It inhibits or downregulates inflammatory mediators and enzymes, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and various cytokines (47665, 47722). The anti-inflammatory effects of diindolylmethane have been seen in animal models of colitis and arthritis (47689, 47705).\nAntibacterial effects\nDiindolylmethane may have antibacterial effects in vitro and when applied topically in animal research. An in vitro, in silico, and porcine model study suggests that diindolylmethane may inhibit the growth of and reduce existing bacterial biofilms of Gram-negative bacteria, specifically with Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A proposed mechanism is that diindolylmethane directly affects transcription factors related to virulence and biofilm formation (112710).\nAnticancer effects\nResearchers are interested in diindolylmethane for the treatment of breast cancer (7664, 7665, 7666, 7668, 7669, 93838). Diindolylmethane has partial estrogen receptor agonist and antagonistic activity (7664, 7669, 93838). It also reduces expression of the estrogen alpha receptor (47639). In vitro, diindolylmethane induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (7668). There is also preliminary evidence that it can inhibit the growth of mammary tumors in animal models (7666). However, the benefits of diindolylmethane might also be independent of the estrogen receptor (47585, 93838). In vitro research indicates that it inhibits tumorigenesis and inflammation via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (7669, 47678). It also inhibits inflammatory cytokines and modulates levels of other cytokines (47622, 47670, 47707). Diindolylmethane also sensitizes breast cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel, increasing apoptosis and cell death. This is likely due to inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B pathway (93841). Furthermore, diindolylmethane seems to increase the expression of BRCA1. Women with insufficient expression of the BRCA1 gene have an increased risk of breast cancer (93839). Additionally, a small clinical study in premenopausal females shows that taking diindolylmethane 75 mg daily for 30 days increases the ratio of estrogen metabolites (i.e., 2-hydroxestrogen:16-alpha-hydroxyestrone) in urine at 60 days when compared with placebo; this ratio is an area of interest to determine risk of developing breast cancer (112709).\n\nDiindolylmethane also has anticancer effects against other cancer cells in laboratory research. For example, it appears to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in cervical, pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, prostate, endometrial, lung, thyroid, ovarian, and colon cancer cells (7188, 47581, 47582, 47587, 47630, 47633, 47650, 47653, 47657, 47681)(47721). In animal models, diindolylmethane delays the progression to cervical cancer (47587, 47706). It is hypothesized that hundreds of gene processes are involved in this activity (47589). In colon and endometrial cancer cells, diindolylmethane appears to have direct cytotoxic effects (47581, 47713, 47749). In animal models of lung cancer, tumorigenesis is reduced (47659, 47723). In vitro, diindolylmethane exhibits antiandrogenic and androgen-independent activity against prostate cancer cell growth (47592, 47691).\n\nIn laboratory research, diindolylmethane has been shown to induce the phase II metabolism of carcinogens, possibly by inducing expression of various enzymes (93845). This might lead to rapid elimination of carcinogens, reducing their activity in the body. Also, a very small clinical study in healthy volunteers microdosed with a known dietary carcinogen shows that taking a standardized product of diindolylmethane 96.6 mg (BioResponse DIM 150, BioResponse, LLC) daily for 7 days prior to and 2 days after carcinogen dosing reduces the maximum concentration, time to peak, and rate of carcinogen absorption but does not significantly reduce the extent of absorption (112712).\n\nDiindolylmethane might also inhibit the spread of cancer. In vitro, it inhibits cancer cell migration, and also angiogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the growth of vascular endothelial cells (47616, 47687).\nEstrogen effects\nDiindolylmethane demonstrates anti-estrogen effects. In vitro, diindolylmethane induces the enzymes responsible for phase I and phase II metabolism, leading to estrogen degradation (47603, 47645, 47744). In individuals with thyroid cancer, diindolylmethane has exhibited anti-estrogenic effects (93482). Diindolylmethane is also an activator of the estrogen receptor (7664, 47601).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in the effects of diindolylmethane in ischemic stroke. A stroke model in rats suggests that diindolylmethane improves cerebral blood flow, decreases brain infarct size, inhibits platelet aggregation, and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation when compared with control. A proposed mechanism of these findings may be attributed to increases in platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme-mediated increases of thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 (112711)."

Diiodothyronine has low affinity for thyroid hormone receptors, only activating them at very high doses (99055). Diiodothyronine suppresses thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), but to a lesser degree than triiodothyronine (T3) (13682, 13683). In rodent research, giving diiodothyronine daily for 4-5 weeks did not change serum levels of TSH, T3, or T4 (106750, 112149).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animals, diiodothyronine reduces levels of blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin; reduces hepatic expression of the GLUT2 glucose transporter; decreases hepatic glucose output; and reverses the impaired insulin responsiveness seen in animals fed a high-fat diet (99055, 106750, 112149). In humans, levels of diiodothyronine seem to correlate with fasting glucose levels (99055).\nMetabolic effects\nIn animals, diiodothyronine increases the basal metabolic rate, with a shift towards utilization of lipids, and increases the rate of oxygen consumption by the mitochondria and liver (13680, 13681, 13683, 99055, 106750). Body temperature is also increased, particularly in response to increased food intake (99055). Diiodothyronine reduces fat accumulation, reducing the inflammatory state that is associated with obesity and related metabolic diseases. It reduces adipocyte size, allowing increased oxygenation, reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines, and reducing the level of oxidative damage to DNA. Diiodothyronine reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increases expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. It also reduces the macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue that occurs in the inflammatory state, and induces a phenotypic switch from M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages to M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages (106750). In a rodent model of obesity, diiodothyronine increases brown adipose tissue, basal metabolic rate, and fatty acid oxidation and improves glycemic control, lipid levels, and total and visceral adiposity (112149).\nWeight loss effects\nIn rodent studies, diiodothyronine reduces body weight and adiposity, and reduces adiposity induced by a high-fat diet. It stimulates resting metabolism, which increases energy expenditure. Fat oxidation rates are increased and there is increased liver fat clearance, leading to lower serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Diiodothyronine increases hormone-sensitive lipase activity, increasing lipolysis in adipocytes and reducing their volume (13685, 99055, 106749, 106750, 112149)."

            "Effectiveness": "INSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Applying dill seed extract to the skin may improve some measures of skin wrinkles, but the overall clinical benefit is small. One clinical study in women with age-related wrinkles around the eyes shows that applying 1% dill seed extract to the face twice daily for 3 months improves skin elasticity and firmness by up to 30%, as well as average wrinkle size by approximately 20%, compared with a placebo formulation. However, the dill formulation does not appear to reduce the number of wrinkles or total wrinkle size (99908).\nDysmenorrhea. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking dill seed powder 3 grams in two divided doses daily for 3 days, beginning at the onset of pain and repeated over three consecutive menstrual cycles, reduces pain associated with dysmenorrhea by a moderate to large amount when compared with baseline. However, it does not improve other menstrual symptoms (101994). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nHyperlipidemia.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, taking dill leaf powder 3 grams daily for 8 weeks lowers LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, and increases HDL cholesterol when compared with placebo, but does not affect triglycerides (112061). In a meta-analysis of 7 trials, dill significantly reduced LDL cholesterol in a subgroup of patients over 50 years of age who took doses above 1000 mg daily for at least 8 weeks.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of dill are the seeds and above ground parts. Dill seed contains volatile oil rich in carvone. The seeds also contain tannins, limonene, phellandrene, chlorogenic acid, linoleic acid, fatty acids, and dillapiol (47792, 99907, 99908, 112060). Dill leaf contains vitamin C, carotenoids, beta-carotene, minerals including iron and potassium, chlorophylls, proteins, fiber, polyphenols, coumarins, and flavonoids (19, 47783, 99909, 112061, 112062).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nDill seed extract inhibits cellular inflammation in a lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage inflammatory model in vitro (47806, 112060). The seed extract inhibits nitric oxide production, expression of the inflammatory proteins iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2, expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and expression of the protein transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa-B (112060).\nAntimicrobial effects\nTraditionally, dill is used for infectious disease. Dill seed oil has antibacterial and antifungal effects in vitro (31330, 46171, 47772, 47783, 47789, 47805).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, taking dill leaf powder, 3 grams daily for 8 weeks, reduces serum levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress, and increases the total antioxidant capacity, when compared with placebo (112061).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animals, an aqueous dill extract administered intravenously lowers blood pressure, dilates blood vessels, stimulates respiration, and slows heart rate (11).\nDermatological effects\nDill is used topically for inflammation, as well as for aging skin. In human research dill extract reduced some signs of wrinkles associated with aging. Dill extract increased dermal elasticity in vitro and in clinical research. This may be related to the increased production of the enzyme lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL), which is involved in the function of elastic fibers in the skin (47788, 99908).\nGastrointestinal effects\nDill is traditionally used for gastrointestinal disorders. In animals, dill seed extract reduces the acidity of gastric juice, reduces expression of the inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in esophageal tissue, and improves esophageal lesions associated with gastric reflux (47769, 112060). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, dill leaf powder in a dose of 3 grams daily orally for 8 weeks, does not reduce the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux or dyspepsia, and does not improve gastric motility (112061).\nGlycemic effects\nPreliminary research in healthy adults and patients with type 2 diabetes shows that dill decreases serum insulin levels and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), but only reduces fasting blood glucose levels at doses of 1500 mg daily or higher (112061, 112062).\nMuscular effects\nDill seed oil has spasmolytic effects on smooth muscle (11).\nSedative effects\nDill is traditionally used for insomnia and other sleep disorders. Dill seed is thought to have sedative effects (11). The constituent carvone might play a role in the sedative effects of dill (39800).\nThyroid effects\nThe flavonoids in dill are thought to be responsible for its hypothyroid effects, possibly by inhibiting enzymes involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones (99909).\nUrinary tract effects\nDill is traditionally used for urinary tract disorders, renal colic, and kidney disease. The seed is thought to have diuretic effects (11). It is also a urinary irritant (19).\nUterine stimulating effects\nDill is traditionally used for dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that it reduces the duration of labor. Dill seeds might stimulate the production of oxytocin (99907)."

While E. coli colonies continued to grow after 3 days of exposure to DMHA 50 microMol, DMHA killed all strains after 7 days. The minimum inhibitory concentration of DMHA was reported to be 10 microMol or greater (92756).\nAntifungal activity\nPreliminary in vitro research suggests that DMHA has fungicidal activity against Candida albicans without compromising host phagocytes and skin cells. Researchers hypothesize that DMHA targets the non-protein cellular components of certain microorganisms and may have broad antimicrobial activity (92762).\nCardiovascular effects\nDMHA is thought to have stimulant and vasoconstrictive effects (92755, 92757, 92758). Preliminary animal research suggests that the intravenous pressor activity of DMHA is around 0.1-0.2% that of epinephrine. In dogs, intravenous DMHA 1 mg caused an increased heart rate and contractility (92758). DMHA also appears to increase respiratory rate in dogs (92758, 92760).\nStimulant effects\nDMHA is thought to have stimulant and vasoconstrictive effects (92755, 92757, 92758). Preliminary animal research shows that DMHA stimulates motor activity, but to a much lesser degree than amphetamine. Administration of intraperitoneal DMHA 20-35 mg/kg or oral DMHA 150 mg/kg to increased motor activity in rats compared to control but did not produce a typical \"amphetamine-like\" effect when compared to amphetamine sulfate (92758)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nInterstitial cystitis. Intravesical instillation of DMSO is effective for treating interstitial cystitis.\nIntravesical instillation of DMSO 50% solution is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of interstitial cystitis (5692, 5694). Instillation of DMSO improves objective and subjective symptoms of interstitial cystitis (5695, 5696, 5697, 47895, 47922, 109633). DMSO appears to be more effective than Bacillus Calmette-Guerin for reducing pain (47827, 47850).\n\nTypically 50 mL of DMSO 50% solution is instilled into the bladder, the catheter is removed, and the patient is instructed to hold the medication in the bladder for 15-20 minutes before voiding (5692, 5695, 47850). For patients who do not respond favorably, 100 mg of hydrocortisone has been added to the solution before instillation for added anti-inflammatory action (5694). A moderate sized clinical trial also shows that intravesical instillation of DMSO 50 mL with triamcinolone 1 mL (10 mg/mL) once weekly for 6 weeks reduces nocturia and pain when compared with intravesical instillation of bupivacaine 30 mL (5 mg/mL), triamcinolone 2 mL (10 mg/mL), and heparin 2 mL (10,000 U/mL) in adults recently diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. Both treatments improve bladder capacity and symptoms of urgency and frequency when compared to baseline (112148). The validity of the study is limited by the lack of a true control or placebo group and the non-blinded conditions; the latter of which was deemed difficult due to the strong odor of DMSO.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nComplex regional pain syndrome. Topical DMSO seems to be effective for treating symptoms in patients with complex regional pain syndrome.\nClinical research shows that applying DMSO 50% cream to the affected area up to five times daily for 2-12 months seems to reduce symptoms associated with complex regional pain syndrome when compared with placebo (47896, 47917, 47921). Additionally, DMSO 50% cream appears to be as effective as N-acetyl cysteine for improving impairment associated with complex regional pain syndrome (47829).\nless\nExtravasation. Topical DMSO seems to be effective for preventing tissue necrosis after extravasation of antineoplastic agents.\nClinical research shows that applying topical DMSO 77% to 90% every 3-8 hours for 10-14 days seems to help prevent tissue necrosis after extravasation with antineoplastic agents when compared with a historical control (4668, 5698, 5699, 47915, 47894).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nScleroderma. Topical DMSO does not seem to treat symptoms in patients with scleroderma.\nClinical research shows that applying DMSO 2% or 70% topically does not help treat symptoms of scleroderma, such as open ulcers, when compared with placebo (6304, 6313, 6314).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAmyloidosis. It is unclear if topical or oral DMSO is beneficial in patients with amyloidosis.\nSeveral small clinical studies and case series suggest that topical or oral DMSO might help treat amyloidosis when compared to baseline (6304, 6306, 47882, 47897, 47909, 47914, 47925, 47926). Doses of DMSO studied include topical DMSO 50% to 100% solution applied daily or twice weekly (6304) and oral DMSO 7-15 grams daily for up to 16 months (6304, 6306, 47882, 47914). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study sizes and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBurns. Although there has been interest in using topical DMSO for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DMSO for this purpose.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical DMSO is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nOne small, open-label study in patients with diabetes shows that applying DMSO 25% daily for 4-15 weeks improves the healing of foot ulcers when compared to baseline (47898). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using topical DMSO for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DMSO for this purpose.\nHerpes zoster (shingles). Clinical research suggests that topical DMSO serves as an effective vehicle for topical idoxuridine in patients with shingles. However, topical DMSO alone does not appear to be beneficial.\nSeveral clinical studies show that applying DMSO topically as a vehicle in combination with idoxuridine 40% reduces the number of lesions and decreases the inflammatory reaction associated with herpes zoster infection when compared with applying DMSO alone (6308, 6309, 6311, 6312, 47832). This seems to indicate that DMSO is an effective vehicle for the application of idoxuridine, although idoxuridine is likely responsible for any observed clinical benefit.\nless\nIntracranial hypertension. It is unclear if intravenous DMSO is beneficial in patients with intracranial hypertension.\nTwo case series have found that administering DMSO intravenously might lower intracranial pressure in people with closed head trauma and elevated intracranial pressure (6300, 6301). In one of these case series, DMSO 10% solution was infused rapidly at a dose of 1 g/kg or DMSO 20% solution was infused and titrated against the intracranial pressure (6300). In another case series, DMSO 28% solution was infused rapidly at a dose of 1.12 g/kg (6301).The validity of this finding is limited by the retrospective nature of the study, lack of comparator group, and small number of evaluated patients.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. There is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of topical DMSO for improving pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.\nOne small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that applying DMSO 25% gel three times daily for 3 weeks reduces pain intensity at rest, during loading, and upon pressure to the joint when compared with placebo (17526). However, other small clinical studies in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee show that topical DMSO does not reduce pain or stiffness or improve physical function when compared with placebo, and is less effective than topical diclofenac with DMSO as the vehicle (17527, 17528). One of these studies used DMSO 45.5% solution applied 4 times daily for 4 weeks (17527). Anecdotal reports suggest that higher concentrations such as 60% to 90% DMSO, and longer periods of treatment, might be more effective (17127).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Small clinical studies suggest that oral DMSO might prevent peptic ulcers.\nA small clinical study in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori shows that taking 5 mL of DMSO 10% four times daily for one year reduces the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence by 87% when compared with placebo and 75% when compared with cimetidine 400 mg daily. Recurrence rates were similar between DMSO and allopurinol (6321). Another small clinical study in patients with erosive gastritis caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use shows that taking DMSO 500 mg four times daily reduces the risk of gastric erosions by 86% when compared with a control group. The risk of gastric erosion was similar between DMSO and allopurinol (47920).\nless\nPostherpetic neuralgia. Clinical research suggests that topical DMSO serves as an effective vehicle for topical idoxuridine in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. However, topical DMSO alone does not appear to be beneficial.\nClinical research in patients with postherpetic neuralgia shows that applying DMSO topically as a vehicle in combination with idoxuridine 40% decreases the pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia when compared with DMSO alone (6310, 6311, 6312). Trigeminal herpes zoster seems most responsive (6312). This seems to indicate that DMSO is an effective vehicle for the application of idoxuridine, although idoxuridine is likely responsible for any observed clinical benefit.\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical DMSO is effective for the prevention of pressure ulcers.\nOne small clinical study in nursing home patients shows that applying DMSO 5% cream topically along with massage and periodic position changes is no more effective than position changes alone for preventing pressure ulcers (47837).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if topical DMSO is beneficial in patients with RA.\nSeveral small clinical studies in patients with RA show that applying a solution of DMSO 60% to 90% to the affected areas 2-4 times daily decreases symptoms associated with RA when compared to baseline (6303, 6304, 47906). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSkin flap ischemia. It is unclear if topical DMSO is effective for the prevention of skin flap ischemia after surgery.\nOne very small clinical study in patients undergoing mastectomy or inguinal lymphadenectomy shows that applying DMSO 60% to the surgical skin flaps every 4 hours for 10 days might reduce skin flap ischemia after surgery when compared with a control group (6307).\nless\nTendinopathy. It is unclear if topical DMSO is beneficial in patients with acute tendinopathy.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute tendinopathies shows that applying DMSO 10% gel three times daily for 14 days improves pain and joint mobility when compared with a placebo gel (47918).\nless\nWound healing.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDMSO easily penetrates the skin (6326). Concentrated DMSO (80% to 100%) penetrates more effectively than concentrations of less than 70%. This is thought to be due to DMSOs ability to exchange and interchange water molecules in cell membranes (6326), and also its ability to interfere with and cause conformational changes in cell membrane phospholipids (6331, 6330). DMSO facilitates topical penetration of many medications (6326, 6330).\nDistribution\nDMSO distributes widely into body fluids and tissues after topical penetration (6326).\nMetabolism\nDMSO is metabolized to methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), dimethyl sulfone and dimethyl sulfide. In humans, about 15% of ingested DMSO is converted to MSM, which has a longer half-life than DMSO (10625, 17127). DMSO has a half-life of 16 hours (47901).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDMSO is a highly polar solvent for many organic and inorganic substances. It also interacts with molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, water, and ethanol (6331).\nAnalgesic effects\nDMSO has been reported to block the conduction of nerve signals in nerves responsible for chronic pain (6329).\nAntibacterial effects\nDMSO demonstrates antimicrobial activity (6326, 6330), possibly by changing the RNA structure necessary for bacterial protein synthesis (6330). Preliminary evidence suggests DMSO may be effective in treating duodenal ulceration in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori (6321).\nAnticancer effects\nSome data suggests DMSO could help antineoplastic agents cross the blood-brain barrier, but other results show DMSO doesn't significantly increase uptake of these compounds (6327, 6330). There is also evidence that suggests DMSO may induce differentiation of tumor cells present in frozen cryopreserved marrow (6328).\nAnticholinesterase effects\nCardiovascular and vasoactive effects of DMSO such as lowered vagal threshold and increased response to nerve and muscle stimulation on skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle are thought to be due to inhibition of anticholinesterase activity (6326, 6330).\nAntioxidant effects\nDMSO has free hydroxyl radical scavenging properties which might contribute to its anti-inflammatory, cryopreservative, cryoprotective, anti-ischemic, and possible radioprotective activity (6326, 6330).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro, DMSO appears to protect against ischemic injury by increasing levels of prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) which in turn increases cyclic-AMP levels and reduces platelet aggregation. DMSO also appears to protect against ischemic injury by decreasing the secretion of fibrinogen and thromboxane A2 from platelets that can cause vasoconstriction, vasospasm, or obstruction of vessels (6302, 6330).\nDermatologic effects\nDMSO has been found to decrease skin adhesions by possibly dissolving collagen fibers and not elastic fibers (6330). DMSO also stabilizes lysosomal membranes and causes vasodilation (6330).\nGenitourinary effects\nDMSO might affect sensory nerves during bladder instillations by stimulating bladder afferent pathways, causing release of nitrogen oxide from afferent neurons (9, 5693). Nitrogen oxide is thought to act as a peripheral neurotransmitter controlling the lower urinary tract function (5693).\nOsteoarthritis effects\nIn osteoarthritis, DMSO is reported to reduce peripheral pain and inflammation, and possibly inhibit degenerative joint changes. Mechanisms might include stabilizing cell membranes, reducing leakage from injured cells, and scavenging free radicals. The sulfur content might improve cartilage formation (17127)."

Oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of CVI. It is unclear if oral diosmin alone is beneficial.\nMost clinical research shows that taking 2-3 tablets daily of a specific combination product (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier) containing micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF), providing diosmin 450 mg and other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet, for 2-6 months modestly improves symptoms of chronic venous diseases such as varicose veins and CVI, including leg pain, heaviness, swelling, and cramps, when compared with baseline or placebo (50892, 54755, 54799, 98597, 98609). Additionally, a large clinical study in patients with CVI shows that results are similar when a chewable form of this product taken 1000 mg daily (Daflon 1000, Les Laboratoires Servier) is compared with 500 mg tablets taken twice daily (112796). An observational study in adults with advanced CVI suggests that taking MPFF 1000 mg, consisting of 90% micronized diosmin and 10% other flavonoids, daily for 6 months in addition to conservative treatment, mainly compression therapy, is associated with improved symptoms (e.g., varicose veins, venous edema, pain) and reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness when compared to baseline (112795). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a comparator group.\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate pelvic venous disorder due to valvular incompetence, two preliminary clinical trials show that this same combination product is beneficial for reducing pain and other symptoms (105287, 108150). In one study, taking 1000 mg daily for 2 months modestly improves quality of life and reduces most symptoms, including pain, tenderness, edema, heaviness, and discomfort, when compared with placebo (108150). Other preliminary clinical research shows that dosing based on severity as either 1000 mg daily for 2 months or 1000 mg twice daily for one month and then 1000 mg once daily for an additional month, reduces pelvic pain by a moderate and large amount, respectively, when compared to baseline. The average time to pain relief was 13.7 or 3.1 days, respectively, for each dosing group. Pelvic venous congestion was reduced more in the higher dose group as calculated following transvaginal and transabdominal duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the pelvic veins (105287).\n\nMicronized diosmin in combination with other flavonoids has also been compared with non-micronized diosmin alone. Although taking non-micronized diosmin 900 mg daily modestly improved clinical symptoms when compared with baseline in early research, taking 1000 mg of micronized purified flavonoid fraction daily for 2 months was more effective (54935, 54950). However, more recent preliminary clinical research in a well-defined patient population with pre-CVI symptoms shows that taking one tablet of a specific non-micronized diosmin (Flebodia, Laboratoire Innotech International) 600 mg daily for 6 months is as effective for reducing leg pain, fatigue, swelling, or tension as taking 1000 mg daily of micronized purified flavonoid fraction providing diosmin plus other flavonoids (Daflon, Laboratórios Servier do Brasil Ltda.) (105293). Also, in a mixed population with pre-CVI and CVI, clinical research shows that taking a specific diosmin (as µsmin Plus, Giellepi S.p.A.) 450 mg once daily for 8 weeks reduces edema by approximately 4% when compared with placebo. Additionally, 98% of patients taking this diosmin product experienced symptom relief, compared with only 29% of those taking placebo (105294). The discrepancy in these findings may be related to the different products used or the severity of disease in the included patient populations.\nless\nHemorrhoids. Oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction or in combination with other compounds, seems to be beneficial for hemorrhoids.\nA meta-analysis of the available research, as well as individual clinical trials, show that taking three tablets of a specific combination product (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier), containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet, twice daily for 4-5 days followed by two tablets of this same product twice daily for up to 3 months, improves signs and symptoms of internal hemorrhoids. The combination appears to stop acute bleeding in up to 92% of patients after 4 days of treatment. It may also reduce symptoms such as anal discomfort, pain, discharge, and local lesions within 2 days of treatment. The combination also seems to reduce the duration and intensity of hemorrhoidal flare-ups (4861, 4900, 8077, 54970, 105282) and improve recovery after hemorrhoidopexy or hemorrhoidectomy (54793, 105284). Maintenance treatment with one tablet of this product twice daily for 2-3 months following acute treatment for hemorrhoids decreases the relapse rate and improves symptoms, including pain, itching, tenesmus, mucous discharge, redness, swelling, and bleeding (4861, 54954).\n\nDiosmin has also been evaluated in combination with hesperidin and troxerutin. Clinical research in adults with acute hemorrhoidal crisis shows that taking a combination product (Triade H, Omikron Italia Srl) providing these ingredients in tapered doses over 43 days reduces progressive pain in approximately 88% of patients, bleeding in 64% of patients, and anal itching in 56% of patients. These changes are significant when compared with placebo (93885). This product was given as one sachet of powdered diosmin 300 mg, troxerutin 300 mg, hesperidin 300 mg, and vitamin C 12 mg mixed in water orally three times daily for 3 days, then two sachets daily for 2 days, then one sachet daily for seven days, followed by one tablet containing diosmin 300 mg, troxerutin 300 mg, and hesperidin 100 mg daily for one month.\n\nDiosmin has also been evaluated in combination with bulk laxatives. Diosmin 600 mg three times daily for 4 days, then 300 mg twice daily for 10 more days in conjunction with psyllium 11 grams daily, seems to modestly improve symptoms after 4 days of treatment (4898). However, this combination does not seem to be as effective as the use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction.\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, seems to be beneficial for venous leg ulcers.\nClinical research in adults with venous leg ulcers up to 10 cm in size shows that taking two tablets daily of a specific combination product (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier), containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet for 2 months in conjunction with compression dressing more than doubles the number of patients with complete healing of ulcers when compared with placebo. Also, the time to healing was reduced. However, in one study there was no effect on the ulcer surface area, symptoms, or healing of ulcers greater than 10 cm in size (10229, 54972, 54984).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBack pain. It is unclear if oral diosmin is beneficial for back pain.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with radicular low back pain shows that taking diosmin (Nanjing Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) moderately improves subjective pain scores after 8 weeks and reduces the use of rescue analgesics after 24 months similarly to intravenous dexamethasone every 3 days with monthly administration of mannitol. Diosmin was administered at doses of 900 mg orally three times daily for 2 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then 450 mg twice daily for one month (95043).\nless\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, is beneficial for CPPS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking one tablet daily of a specific combination product containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet (Daflon) for 8 weeks in combination with standard treatment involving antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs improves overall symptoms of CPPS at 6 months similarly to taking alfuzosin, an alpha-blocker, along with standard treatment for 12 weeks. However, there was no benefit when the diosmin product was used alone, without standard treatment. At 12 months, symptoms were modestly more improved in those taking alfuzosin (105297).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, is beneficial for patients undergoing CABG surgery.\nIn patients about to undergo CABG for impaired left ventricular function, clinical research shows that a specific combination product containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier), taken as 3000 mg daily for 4 days, followed by 1000 mg daily for 3 days preoperatively, does not reduce the postoperative length of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital, inotropic medication requirements, or left ventricular ejection fraction when compared with placebo. However, levels of troponin I and lactate were lower, and patient status based on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification was modestly improved (105285).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction or in combination with other compounds, is beneficial for diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with type 2 diabetes shows that taking one tablet of a specific combination product containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier) twice daily for 45 days modestly decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum glucose when compared to baseline (54977). However, a prospective observational study in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes has found that taking a specific product (Flebotrofine, AMNOL Chimica Biologica) containing diosmin for 3 months is not associated with improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline. Other ingredients in this product included L-arginine, troxerutin, hesperidin, black currant extract, and gotu kola extract (108151). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral diosmin is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and metabolic syndrome on oral antidiabetic therapy shows that taking diosmin 1 gram daily (Dioven, Amryia Pharmaceutical Co.) for 12 weeks, with or without hesperidin 1 gram daily, improves diabetic neuropathy as measured by the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) when compared with standard care alone. In addition, the improvements in measures of diabetic neuropathy were greater when diosmin and hesperidin are taken together compared with either supplement alone, suggesting a synergistic effect (112797). However, the validity of this study is limited by inadequate blinding.\nless\nLymphedema. It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction or in combination with other compounds, is beneficial for lymphedema.\nClinical research shows that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Daflon 500, Les Laboratoires Servier) containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet daily for 6 months may improve drainage of lymph from the arms after breast cancer surgery, but does not reduce arm swelling or other clinical signs of lymphedema, when compared with placebo (10227). A small clinical study in patients with severe breast cancer-related lymphedema shows that taking a specific combination product (Linfaden, OMEGA PHARMA Srl) containing diosmin 200 mg, coumarin 30.6 mg, and arbutin 3.7 mg twice daily for 2 weeks and then once daily for 4 weeks, in addition to complex congestive therapy (CDT), reduces upper limb excess volume by 521 mL, compared with a 256 mL reduction in the CDT-only group (101646). It is unclear if the effects are due to diosmin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral diosmin is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy on oral antidiabetic therapy shows that taking diosmin 1 gram daily (Dioven, Amryia Pharmaceutical Co.) for 12 weeks, with or without hesperidin 1 gram daily, reduces body mass index, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but does not change systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with standard care alone. These effects are enhanced when diosmin is taken in combination with hesperidin compared with either supplement taken alone or control (112797). However, the validity of this study is limited by inadequate blinding.\nless\nMinor bleeding. It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, is beneficial for minor bleeding.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with idiopathic epistaxis shows that taking a specific combination product containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg (Daflon, Servier) daily for 1-3 months modestly reduces emergency room visits and need for cauterization due to failure of light nasal packing when compared with no treatment (101644). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding.\nless\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome. It is unclear if oral diosmin is beneficial for reducing the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\nObservational research in patients at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) following a previous cancellation of embryo transfer has found that taking diosmin 1000 mg twice daily for 10 days after oocyte retrieval is associated with a 6.2% incidence of moderate to severe OHSS, compared to 13.4% in the patients that had not received diosmin. Also, there were no cases of severe OHSS (105295). This study is limited by its retrospective, observational design.\nless\nVaricose veins. It is unclear if oral diosmin, as part of a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, is beneficial for varicose veins.\nIn patients with mild varicose veins such as spider veins or reticular veins, some observational research has evaluated the use of a specific combination product (Detralex; Servier France) containing diosmin 450 mg plus other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg per tablet, taken as one tablet twice daily for 6 weeks, starting 2 weeks before sclerotherapy. This research has found that taking this product is associated with decreased leg heaviness, pain, swelling sensation, night cramps, and itching after sclerotherapy when compared with patients not using this treatment. It is also associated with a reduction in pain and swelling sensation from before sclerotherapy when compared with those not using this treatment. Additionally, the use of this product is associated with a slight reduction in hyperpigmentation following sclerotherapy, although there were no benefits on other sclerotherapy-related adverse effects, including phlebitis and necrosis (105283). In patients with varicose veins of greater severity, observational research has found that taking this same product 1000 mg daily for 30 days, starting on the day of mechanochemical ablation with mini-phlebectomy or foam sclerotherapy, is associated with a modest reduction in the severity of varicose veins, such as swelling, heaviness, and itching, after 30 days, but not after 7 or 14 days, when compared with no treatment (105286).\n\nFor more information on the use of diosmin for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which can occur concomitantly with varicose veins, refer to the CVI discussion.\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral diosmin is beneficial for prevention of VTE.\nIn patients experiencing their first femoropopliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), preliminary clinical research shows that taking diosmin 600 mg daily for 12 months, in addition to rivaroxaban and elastic compression stockings, reduces the frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome to 9%, compared to 49% in those not taking diosmin. There were also fewer patients with chronic venous disease or DVT recurrence at 12 months (105296).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate diosmin for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDiosmin has most often been used alone or with other flavonoids in doses of 450-1350 mg daily for 1-6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSachets of a specific commercial product used in clinical research (Triade H, Omikron Italia Srl) contain 300 mg each of diosmin, troxerutin, and hesperidin, as well as 12 mg of vitamin C. The tablets of this commercial product contained diosmin 300 mg, troxerutin 300 mg, and hesperidin 100 mg plus excipients (93885).\n\nClinical trials have also used a specific formulation of diosmin (Daflon 500 and Daflon, Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier). Each tablet of Daflon 500 contains a micronized formulation of diosmin 450 mg and other flavonoids, such as hesperidin, 50 mg extracted from Rutaceae species (4861, 4898, 4900, 10227, 10229).

The patient had also been taking aspirin and diosmin for several years.

Some research suggests that diosmin does not affect CYP3A4 activity (95040). However, other research suggests that diosmin alters the metabolism of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Laboratory and animal research show that oral administration of diosmin for 7 days prior to oral administration of carbamazepine increases plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, decreases the clearance of carbamazepine, and decreases the formation of carbamazepine's active metabolite (95039). Additionally, pharmacokinetic research in healthy male subjects shows that taking diosmin (Venex) 500 mg daily for 10 days prior to oral administration of carbamazepine 200 mg increases blood levels of carbamazepine by approximately 58% and decreases carbamazepine clearance by 42% (95041).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nPrior to absorption, most diosmin is hydrolyzed to diosmetin by the intestinal microflora after oral administration (98594). Diosmetin is the primary metabolite found in circulation (98041, 98594). After absorption of diosmin and diosmetin, maximum blood levels occur at 1-2 hours, with a half-life of approximately 31.5 hours (93887, 98594). Some diosmin preparations use a micronized formulation. The smaller particle size helps to increase absorption (4900, 98594).\nMetabolism\nMost diosmin is metabolized to diosmetin in the colon prior to absorption (93887). Diosmin is also metabolized by O-methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation in the liver. After oral administration of diosmin, diosmetin is the primary metabolite found in circulation (95041).\nExcretion\nDiosmin metabolites are excreted in the urine (93887). Both diosmin and diosmetin are excreted in the feces (93887).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDiosmin is one of over 4,000 flavonoids found in plants (4919, 4959, 5006, 95039, 95040, 95041, 95042). Diosmin is in a class of flavonoids primarily derived from citrus fruits and is known as a citrus bioflavonoid. It is closely related to other citrus bioflavonoids such as quercetin, rutin, and hesperidin.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of diosmin, alone or in combination with other citrus bioflavonoids, have been demonstrated in numerous human, animal, and in vitro studies (54735, 54736, 54743, 54749, 54948, 54953, 54958). The anti-inflammatory effects of diosmin might play a role in its reported vascular protective effects (4861, 4898, 4900, 4954, 101647). Additionally, diosmin may reduce radicular pain that is caused by inflammation of the nerves, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduction of anti-inflammatory mediators (95043). Diosmin inhibits phosphodiesterase and increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which causes decreased production of inflammatory prostaglandins E2 and F2 and thromboxane A2 and B2. Diosmin can also reduce the generation of free radicals (4861, 4898, 4900, 4954, 101647). In the reduction of radicular pain, diosmin inhibits prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane A2, decreases levels of endothelial adhesion molecules, and reduces the activation of neutrophils (95043).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that a diosmin metabolite, diosmetin, might be hepatoprotective. Diosmetin might have direct antioxidant effects, increase glutathione (GSH) levels, and decrease lipid peroxidation (4954).\n\nDue to its antioxidant effects, there is interest in using diosmin to protect the liver and other organs against heavy metal exposure. Animal research shows that diosmin reduces liver and other organ damage caused by exposure to the heavy metals cadmium and lead (101642, 101645).\nVascular effects\nDiosmin alone, or in combination with other citrus bioflavonoids, is most often used for vascular conditions such as hemorrhoids and varicose veins. Diosmin seems to work by improving venous tone, reducing stasis, restoring normal capillary permeability, and improving lymphatic drainage. Diosmin might improve venous tone and reduce stasis by improving vasculature response to adrenergic stimulation. Diosmin's anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects seem to help restore normal capillary permeability and density. Diosmin inhibits phosphodiesterase and increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which causes decreased production of inflammatory prostaglandins E2 and F2 and thromboxanes A2 and B2. Diosmin can also decrease levels of endothelial adhesion molecules, reduce the activation of neutrophils, and reduce the generation of free radicals (4861, 4898, 4900, 4954, 95043, 101647)."

In rats with experimentally-induced diabetes, seed extracts produce antihyperglycemic effects (3834, 108742). In hyperglycemic rats, giving a polyphenol-rich extract of the leaves as 250-500 mg/kg daily for 8 weeks reduces blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, leptin, and amylin, and increases insulin, peptide YY, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, when compared with no treatment. The extract restores free radical scavenging potential in pancreatic beta-cells and alters expression of genes in the insulin signaling pathway, reducing necrosis and other damage (108741).\nAntilipemic effects\nIn rats with experimentally-induced diabetes, an aqueous extract of divi-divi seeds reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels (3834). A seed kernel extract given to diabetic rats for 28 days attenuates diabetes-induced increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (108742).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that divi-divi methanolic extract and the specific divi-divi constituents lupeol, beta-amyrin, and alpha-amyrin, inhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98280, 98281). Divi-divi methanolic extract also has antifungal activity in vitro (98281).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, administering a hydro-methanolic extract of divi-divi seed kernels as 400 mg/kg daily for 28 days attenuates increases in liver transaminase levels, although not to the same degree as metformin. Divi-divi also improves the histologic structure of the liver (108742).\nSexual effects\nAn ethanolic extract of divi-divi root given to male rats for 28 days enhances sexual behavior. It increases mounting and penetration frequencies, testosterone levels, spermatogenesis, and testes weight and also improves testes histologic architecture (108743)."

D-mannose 3 grams daily for up to 2 weeks or 2 grams daily for up to 6 months has been used with apparent safety in clinical research (91141, 93883, 99656). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of taking D-mannose long-term.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children with carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1b. D-mannose 300-1020 mg/kg daily, taken in 3-6 divided doses, has been used with apparent safety, long-term (13345, 13346, 13348, 100978, 100979, 100980, 100981). While total daily doses up to 1020 mg/kg have been used safely when taken in divided doses, single doses greater than 200 mg/kg are more likely to cause osmotic diarrhea (100977).

In children, loose stools and abdominal bloating have been reported at D-mannose doses ranging from 100 mg/kg three times daily to 150 mg/kg five times daily (13344, 100979). Diarrhea has been reported in adults taking D-mannose 2 grams daily for 6 months (91141). While diarrhea and loose stools have been reported at lower doses, taking a single D-mannose dose greater than 200 mg/kg is more likely to cause osmotic diarrhea (100977).\nless\nImmunologic\nSerum sickness-like reaction (SSLR) has been documented in one case report involving a 16 year-old female taking a D-mannose containing combination product for about 3 weeks. The patient's symptoms resolved after stopping her complete medication regimen.

It is unclear if this reaction is due to D-mannose, other ingredients, or the combination (117119).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, there is concern that excessive doses (toxic amounts unspecified) of D-mannose might be toxic to the kidneys (13348).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCarbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1b. Oral D-mannose prevents certain hematologic and gastrointestinal complications in patients with this condition. However, it's unclear if it helps to prevent liver complications.\nCarbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1b is a rare and often lethal congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). It is characterized by protein loss in the digestive tract, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia, liver disease, and failure to thrive. The disorder is also called phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) deficiency or mannose-phosphate-isomerase CDG (MPI-CDG). Taking D-mannose 300-1020 mg/kg daily in 3-6 divided doses long-term can reduce protein loss, hypoglycemia, coagulation disorders, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients, usually infants and children, with this disorder (13344, 13345, 13346, 13348, 100978, 100979, 100980, 100981). While D-mannose seems to be effective for stabilizing the signs and symptoms of this condition, it is not clear whether it can prevent liver complications. In two cases, D-mannose reduced hepatomegaly after 6 months or 2 years of therapy (13348, 100980). In other cases, however, hepatic fibrosis developed despite D-mannose treatment for up to 6 years (13345, 100978). These discrepant finding are thought to be due to the variable levels of liver disease severity at the time of D-mannose treatment initiation (100977).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Clinical studies suggest that oral D-mannose does not reduce the rate of UTI recurrence in community dwelling pre- and postmenopausal adults. It is unclear if oral D-mannose is beneficial for the treatment of UTIs when used alone or in combination with other ingredients.\nA large clinical trial of about 600 community dwelling pre- and postmenopausal females with a recent history of recurring UTI (defined as 3 UTIs in the past year or 2 UTIs in the past 6 months) shows that taking D-mannose powder 2 grams daily for 6 months does not reduce the rate of UTI recurrence when compared with placebo (113576). Additionally, a small clinical study of postmenopausal females with a history of recurrent UTI which compared D-mannose powder 2 grams daily with standard of care was halted early due to likely futility (111756). Prior to the publication of these two studies, a systematic review of the available research concluded that there was no strong evidence for or against the use of D-mannose for UTI prevention or treatment (110013). One relatively large clinical trial included in this body of evidence shows that D-mannose reduces UTI recurrence when compared with no prophylaxis, with rates of 32% and 61%, respectively, but is less effective than nitrofurantoin 50 mg daily (20%) (91141).\n\nD-mannose has also been evaluated for UTI prevention in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in older adults undergoing cystoscopy shows that taking D-mannose 500 mg plus Saccharomyces boulardii 3 billion CFU twice daily for 6 days after the procedure reduces the incidence of positive urine cultures (0% vs. 19%) when compared with no treatment (112363). However, this study did not report on the rate of symptomatic UTIs. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to D-mannose, Saccharomyces boulardii, or the combination. Low-quality research suggests that taking specific combination products containing D-mannose may be beneficial for UTI prevention. These products have combined D-mannose 250 mg with cranberry extract, tara gum, and probiotic bacteria (1-2.5 billion live cells of L. plantarum LP01, L. paracasei LPC09, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST10) (93884); D-mannose (dose unspecified) with cranberry, and L. paracasei (Lactoflorene Cist, Montefarmaco) (104210); and D-mannose 500 mg with noni fruit extract 200 mg and N-acetylcysteine 100 mg (97360).\n\nAdditionally, a clinical study in Spain in adults with a kidney transplant shows that taking D-mannose 2000 mg plus proanthocyanidins and other ingredients daily for 3 months after kidney transplant does not prevent UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when compared with proanthocyanidins in the first 6 months after transplant. The study lacked a placebo comparator group and had limited statistical power (117118).\n\nD-mannose has also been evaluated in small, low-quality studies as a treatment for existing UTI, alone or in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in females with an acute UTI shows that taking a specific D-mannose product (Mannocist, Laboratori Farmaceutici Krymi) 1.5 grams twice daily for 3 days, and then once daily for 10 days, improves some symptoms of UTI when compared to baseline (93883). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. A clinical study in females aged 18-45 with uncomplicated UTIs shows that taking a supplement containing D-mannose 2 grams, astragalus, citric acid, dandelion, and prebiotics dissolved in water twice daily for 5 days improves complete resolution of UTI symptoms and clearance of bacteriuria at days 6 and 35 when compared with placebo (111757). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to D-mannose, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of D-mannose for its other uses.\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSupplemental D-mannose is rapidly absorbed (93883). It is absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract and is transported by mannose-specific transporters. The mannose content in foods and its bioavailability from foods has not been characterized (13343, 13347, 113576).\nDistribution\nD-mannose is present in small amounts in the blood, about 100 times less than glucose (13343, 13347). After absorption, D-mannose reaches peripheral organs within about 30 minutes. It is not stored in the body (93883).\nExcretion\nFollowing supplementation, D-mannose is excreted in the urine (93883, 113576).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nD-mannose is a 6-carbon sugar and an isomer of dextrose. It differs from dextrose only in the position of the hydroxyl group at the second carbon (13342). D-mannose is used by the body for glycosylation of proteins and fibroblast activity (13343, 13347).\nMetabolic effects\nD-mannose is primarily derived from glucose via the enzyme phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). People with a rare genetic deficiency of PMI, known as carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1b, lose protein via the intestines and can present with liver disease, hypoglycemia, and blood clotting disorders. PMI deficiency eliminates or decreases the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate from fructose 6-phosphate. Supplemental D-mannose appears to overcome this deficiency (13346, 13347).\nToxicity\nIn laboratory research, adding a large dose of D-mannose to rat embryo culture resulted in growth retardation and imperfect closure of neural-tubes; however, it is not clear how this finding translates to oral intake of D-mannose and there are no reports of teratogenic or mutagenic effects in humans (13351).\nUrinary tract effects\nPreliminary research suggests that supplemental D-mannose might interfere with the adhesion of Escherichia coli bacteria to urothelial cells in the urinary tract, theoretically providing protection from urinary tract infections (UTIs) (13342, 91141, 110013, 112363). Bacteria such as Escherichia coli produce lectins, which bind the organism to sugar residues, such as D-mannose, on host epithelial cells. Theoretically, giving supplemental D-mannose can bind the bacteria and prevent attachment to the vaginal and urinary tract lining (13349, 13350, 17079, 91141, 93884). In vitro tests indicate that D-mannose can partially or completely inhibit binding of around 50% of Escherichia coli strains to epithelial cells (17080). D-mannose also appears to prevent the binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Proteus mirabilis, and some Salmonella species in laboratory models (93883). By binding to bacteria in urine, the bacteria remain free in the urine and are eliminated upon urination (93883, 93884)."

            "Overview": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) is a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid that is found along with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) in fish and marine animals (12914, 90718). This fatty acid is in the same family as alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), the essential fatty acid precursor of DHA and EPA (12914). DHA is present in very high concentrations in the brain, retina, and spermatozoa (48087, 90718).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. DHA has been used safely in studies lasting up to 4 years (1016, 1043, 6413, 10321, 10869, 11333, 90684). Fish oil supplements containing DHA have also been safely used in studies lasting up to 7 years (1016). While doses of DHA up to 4 grams orally daily have been used safely in some clinical research (6143), there is some concern that high intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA might increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of DHA plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3 fatty acid also found in fish oil, to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used intravenously and appropriately, in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), short-term. Daily infusions with an omega-3 fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (Omegavenous 10%, Fresenius Aktiengesellschaft) providing 4.2 grams/day of DHA and EPA has been used safely for 14 days (1004).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Doses greater than 3 grams daily might decrease platelet aggregation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of DHA plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3 fatty acid, to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739). Additionally, clinical research on the use prescription omega-3 ethyl esters in doses of at least 4 grams daily has found an increased risk for atrial fibrillation in adults with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors (114311, 116881, 116882).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. DHA is a component of some infant formula (424, 1045, 5708, 5941, 7599, 14403, 15003, 15495, 17735, 48088)(48194, 48266, 48343, 90665, 90713, 90716, 110357). In children 7 years and older, DHA 30 mg/kg daily has been used safely for up to 4 years (90684). Also, DHA 0.4-1 grams daily has been safely used in children ages 4 years and older for up to 1 year (11333, 90665, 100940, 104560).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in preterm infants born less than 29 weeks gestation. Although not all findings agree (110356, 110359), supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 40 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg daily might increase the risk of developing or worsening bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to control emulsion (96523, 110359).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. An intake of DHA 650 mg daily from food and/or supplements during pregnancy seems to be required to prevent a reduction in DHA status before delivery (110329). DHA is commonly used during pregnancy and lactation and is a component of some prenatal supplements. DHA is a normal component of breast milk, with higher levels in breast milk following term vs. preterm pregnancies (14393, 14394, 14396, 14400, 14403, 14397, 20000, 47977, 47994, 48095)(90672, 90718, 110355). When taken as a prenatal supplement, DHA increases DHA levels in breast milk (90685). Doses of DHA ranging from 300-800 mg daily beginning as early as the first trimester of pregnancy have been used safely in clinical research (90672, 90676, 90687, 90694, 114306). When taken during lactation, DHA increases DHA levels in breast milk (109214, 110362). When initiated within 72 hours of delivery of a very preterm infant, taking DHA 1.2 grams daily increases DHA levels in breast milk within 14 days (109214). One study found that DHA supplementation during lactation increased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in breast-feeding infants born less than 29 weeks gestational age (104559); however, it is unclear if this was due to DHA or various confounding factors. The tolerable upper intake level of DHA during pregnancy or lactation has not been established; most experts recommend DHA 200-300 mg daily. While it is typically advised that this need is met by consuming 8-12 ounces of seafood weekly during pregnancy and 4-8 ounces weekly during lactation, those with nutrient deficiency or those following a vegan diet may meet this need with supplementation (95740, 95741).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, DHA is generally well-tolerated when used in doses up to 3 grams daily. Intravenously, DHA seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Belching, fishy aftertaste, loose stools, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Some case reports raise concerns about increased risk of bleeding with high doses of fish oil containing DHA.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, DHA might increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. However, this appears to be primarily due to increases in the large buoyant type of LDL particles. The small, dense type of LDL particles are reduced (6143, 48013, 48078, 48083, 48174, 48338).\n\nPrescription fish oil products in the U.S., which contain both DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), must carry a warning regarding the risk for recurrent atrial fibrillation and flutter in adults taking 4-8 grams of fish oil daily (116881, 116882). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also updated the product information for omega-3 acid ethyl esters to include an increased risk of atrial fibrillation when taken in doses of at least 4 grams daily. The EMA also recommends cessation of use if atrial fibrillation develops (114311). These additions to product labeling are based on clinical studies of prescription ethyl-EPA and omega-3 acid ethyl ester products which identified an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in adults with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors (114311, 116881, 116882).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, DHA has been associated with one report of rash and one report of warmth on hands in one clinical study (48217). In another clinical study, two patients taking DHA 400 mg daily reported acne (11333). In another clinical study, one parent of a pediatric patient treated with DHA 600 mg daily reported increased hair loss beginning 6 weeks after completion of supplementation (90699). It is unclear if this adverse effect is specifically related to DHA intake.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, DHA may cause gastrointestinal upset, fishy aftertaste, belching, flatulence, heartburn, loose stools, anorexia, and dry mouth (10869, 11333, 48217, 109218). There is also some evidence that increased serum levels of DHA might be associated with an increased risk for atrophic gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, but further research is needed to clarify this finding (8709).\n\nFor fish oils containing EPA and DHA, side effects can include fishy taste, belching, nausea, and loose stools (1009, 1313, 8699, 10007). Three people with pre-existing familial adenomatous polyposis were diagnosed with malignant lesions during the course of long-term fish oil use (999).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, one patient in one clinical study who was taking DHA 1, 2, or 4 grams daily (specific dose unclear) reported decreased libido (48217).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, DHA might cause nose bleeds, but this is uncommon. Onset of severe nose bleeds has been reported in one clinical study in one child who took DHA 600 mg daily (98542). Although most clinical research shows that DHA does not affect blood clotting when taken alone (11112, 11113, 48020), there is some concern that taking high doses of oils providing DHA along with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) might decrease blood coagulation and increase the risk of bleeding (1313). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that consumers limit intake of EPA plus DHA to 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement (95739).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, DHA may cause dizziness, headache, insomnia, fatigue, and anxiety (10869, 11333, 48217). In one clinical study, one parent of a pediatric patient treated with DHA 600 mg daily reported increased disruptive behavior in the child (90699).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, DHA may cause watery eyes but results are inconsistent. In one clinical study, five of 167 infants fed formula containing 0.32% or 0.64% DHA experienced watery eyes. However, none of the infants fed formula containing 0.96% DHA experienced watery eyes (90670). In one clinical study, one patient taking DHA 400 mg daily experienced an ear infection. It is unclear if this event was related to DHA supplementation.\nless\nOncologic\nOrally, DHA may increase the risk of prostate cancer, but additional research is needed to clarify this finding. A meta-analysis of data from observational studies found that higher dietary intake of DHA is associated with a non-linear increased risk of prostate cancer (90677). It is unclear if supplemental DHA intake is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, worsened asthma symptoms were reported by one parent of one patient with asthma taking DHA 600 mg daily (90699).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHyperlipidemia. Most research shows that taking oral DHA alone or with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) seems to modestly reduce triglyceride levels. However, DHA does not decrease total cholesterol and may increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.\nClinical research shows that taking DHA 1.25-4 grams daily for up to 7 weeks can reduce triglyceride levels by 17% to 24% in adult patients with mild hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, or hypertriglyceridemia (6143, 48013, 48338). Also, taking DHA-enriched fish oil providing DHA 810 mg plus EPA 210 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 23% in premenopausal adults with mild hypertriglyceridemia (99131). Most clinical research suggests that DHA does not decrease total cholesterol (6143, 48013, 99131). Although some conflicting research exists, most research suggests that DHA modestly increases HDL cholesterol (6143, 48013, 48338, 99131, 109216). Most clinical research shows that DHA increases LDL cholesterol by about 8% to 13.6% (6143, 48174, 48338, 109216). However, it may actually decrease levels of small, dense LDL particles (48174).\n\nThere are conflicting results regarding the effects of DHA on cholesterol levels in children. One preliminary clinical study in children with primary hyperlipidemia shows that taking DHA 500 mg alone or along with EPA does not improve cholesterol levels when compared with control. However, this study was probably too small to detect statistically significant changes (90712). Other research in children aged 9 years and up with familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia shows that taking DHA (DHASCO oil, Martek Biosciences Corp.) 1.2 grams daily for 6 weeks along with the National Cholesterol Education Program Step II (NCEP-II) diet actually increases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol when compared to following the diet alone (48078, 48083). However, some clinical research shows that DHA increases the large buoyant type of LDL particles, but actually decreases the small, dense type (48083).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Most research shows that taking oral DHA alone or with other ingredients does not slow or improve cognitive decline associated with age.\nMost clinical research, from individual studies and a meta-analysis, shows that taking DHA orally, alone or with additional eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) for up to 36 months, does not slow or improve age-related cognitive decline (97175, 103313). In contrast, results from one large clinical study show that taking DHA 900 mg daily in the absence of EPA for 24 weeks improves episodic memory and visuospatial learning when compared with placebo in patients with age-related cognitive decline. However, DHA did not affect working memory or executive function (90717).\n\nDHA has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized clinical study in older adults with subjective cognitive impairment and objective mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a DHA-rich fish oil containing DHA 1.1 grams and EPA 0.4 grams 3 times daily with high-flavanol cocoa for 12 months does not improve most measures of cognitive function, and moderately worsens reaction time variability, executive function, and alertness when compared with placebo. Additionally, there is no evidence of benefit on brain volumes, and patients who took DHA-rich fish oil and cocoa had greater decreases in cortical volume at 12 months when compared with placebo (111453).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Taking oral DHA does not seem to slow Alzheimer disease progression.\nPopulation research has found that a 0.1 gram per day increment of dietary DHA intake is associated with a 37% reduced risk of Alzheimer disease when taken for 2-21 years (15041, 96527). However, a dose-response relationship was not seen, and a correlation between DHA blood concentration and dementia was not seen (96527). Furthermore, clinical research shows that taking DHA 2 grams daily for 18 months does not slow cognitive or functional decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (48290). DHA has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking DHA 500 mg, as part of fish 1 gram with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 150 mg, and along with lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and vitamin E 15 mg (Memory Health) daily for 12 months does not affect disease severity when compared with placebo. However, there were modest increases the number of patients experiencing either an improvement or an attenuated decline in memory and mood (109764). The effect of DHA alone is unclear from this study.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Most research shows that taking oral DHA does not improve ADHD symptoms.\nLow plasma levels of DHA are associated with ADHD in children (7599, 15496). Although some preliminary clinical research shows that DHA might improve aggression, emotional problems, and social relationships in children with ADHD (15494, 100940), taking DHA 345-500 mg daily or 3.6 grams weekly does not seem to improve objective or subjective measures of ADHD symptoms when compared with placebo (7599, 15495, 100940).\n\nDHA has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in drug-naïve Italian children ages 6-12 years with mild to moderate ADHD shows that taking DHA 87 mg in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) daily for 12 months does not improve inattentive symptoms, global functioning, or learning skills when compared with placebo. This study also did not identify a correlation between plasma fatty acid levels and ADHD symptoms (111058).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Most research shows that oral DHA does not prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Some research suggests that it might increase the risk of BPD in infants born before 29 weeks gestation.\nOne meta-analysis of clinical research in over 3,500 preterm infants shows that administration of EPA and DHA as part of formula or as a direct oral dose, starting within one month of birth, does not increase or decrease the risk for BPD, regardless of the dose of DHA administered (102390). A more recent meta-analysis of four clinical trials limited to infants born less than 29 weeks gestation also shows that administration of DHA at levels of at least 40 mg/kg, or at levels of at least 0.4% total fatty acids in breast milk or formula, does not increase or decrease the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (110359). However, in this latter meta-analysis, when only clinical trials using a more stringent definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included, there was a modest INCREASED risk (110359). Similar findings occurred in a study that was terminated early. This research shows that maternal supplementation with DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks gestation, has no effect on mortality of breastfed infants or survival without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. However, the occurrence of BPD and severe BPD in surviving infants of mothers taking DHA were increased when compared to those whose mothers took placebo (104559). The conclusions of this study are limited by the early termination, the provision of intravenous DHA-rich lipids to some infants per standard of clinical care, and the increased number of infants born via cesarean delivery to the mothers randomized to DHA.\n\nA more recent clinical trial has investigated the inclusion of arachidonic acid in an enteral emulsion providing DHA. One clinical trial in preterm infants born before 29 weeks gestation shows that supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 50 mg/kg and arachidonic acid 100 mg/kg (Formulaid, DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) until 36 weeks postmenstrual age does not increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or other major morbidities compared to control (MCToil, Nutricia) emulsion. Also, infants given the arachidonic acid and DHA required 17 fewer days of respiratory support (110356).\nless\nCognitive function. Most research shows that oral DHA does not improve cognitive function in healthy adults.\nMost clinical research shows that taking DHA 250-1000 mg daily for up to 6 months does not improve cognitive function in healthy children, healthy adults, or older females (48194, 48216, 48266, 90668, 90708, 104560). Also, cognitive function does not seem to be improved when compared with placebo in trials in which omega-3 products containing higher ratios of DHA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were used. These trials have used a specific product (Efamol Ltd) containing DHA 1.16 grams and EPA 0.17 grams daily (90707), DHA 900 mg plus EPA 270 mg (Accelon DHA EE, BASF) daily (109215), or fish oil (Dasbrain, Max Biocare) providing DHA 520 mg or 270 mg daily (109310), for 3 or 6 months in children and adults. However, some clinical research shows that taking algal oil containing DHA 600 mg daily for 16 weeks improves reading scores when compared with placebo in a subgroup of children ages 6-10 years who are below the 20th percentile for reading (90699). However, these results could not be replicated in a later study that included only children below the 20th percentile for reading (98542). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Taking DHA does not appear to improve reading scores in children at or above the 20th percentile for reading, and there does not appear to be any benefit of DHA on working memory in any children (90699).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Most research shows that oral DHA does not improve symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nClinical research in infants, children, and young adults with cystic fibrosis shows that taking DHA (DHA-basic, CASEN Fleet SLU) 50 mg/kg daily for 48 weeks does not improve spirometry measures, reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa primary infections, or reduce the number of, or time to, total or severe pulmonary exacerbations when compared with placebo (109217). Also, small clinical studies show that taking DHA 70 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks, or 100 mg/kg daily for one month and then 1 gram daily for 11 months, does not improve lung function or overall health in patients with cystic fibrosis (48119, 90665). One very small clinical trial in people aged 6-18 years with cystic fibrosis also shows that taking a DHA-rich triglyceride (Tridocosahexanoin-AOX; Brudy NEN) providing DHA 50 mg/kg daily for 12 months does not improve sputum cellularity or most measures of pulmonary function when compared with placebo (114307). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nDepression. Most research shows that oral DHA does not improve depression, regardless of the type.\nTaking DHA orally does not seem to relieve symptoms of major depression, peripartum depression, or postpartum depression in most patients (10869, 48030, 48238, 90680, 90691, 90692, 89353, 102391). Also, taking DHA for two weeks prior to the start of interferon-alpha therapy does not appear to prevent depression during interferon-alpha treatment in patients with hepatitis C, although it may delay depression onset by about 6 weeks (90710).\nless\nMacrosomia. Taking oral DHA during pregnancy does not seem to prevent fetal macrosomia.\nClinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking DHA (S-oil, DSM Nutritional Products) 800 mg daily, starting before 15 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, with or without dietary counselling, does not reduce the incidence of macrosomia when compared with taking DHA 200 mg daily (109218).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary intakes or higher blood levels of DHA are associated with a lower odds of developing AMD. However, the overall evidence is weak (10324, 112095).\n\nA small clinical study in adults with AMD shows that taking a combination of DHA 280 mg, lutein 12 mg, and zeaxanthin 0.6 mg daily for one year increases macular pigment optical density by 31% when compared with placebo. Increased macular pigment optical density is associated with improve vision performance (90678). However, other clinical research suggests that adding DHA plus EPA to an AREDS formula, with or without lutein and zeaxanthin, does not reduce the time to development of AMD or vision loss in adults at high risk of progression to advanced AMD when compared with the AREDS formula alone (60281).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if adding DHA to infant formula prevents atopic dermatitis.\nEvidence from an observational, open-label study shows that giving full-term infants formula with added DHA 17 mg/100 kcal and arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) as needed for 12 months does not prevent the development of eczema when compared to control formulas without DHA and arachidonic acid (92505).\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if oral DHA during pregnancy and/or lactation prevents atopic disease in the infant.\nClinical research shows that supplementation with DHA during pregnancy may modestly protect against some respiratory symptoms in the infants of atopic mothers. Prenatal supplementation with DHA 400 mg, taken daily from 18-22 weeks' gestation until delivery, reduces the incidence of phlegm with nasal discharge or nasal congestion in the infant by the age of 18 months by approximately 22% and the incidence of fever with phlegm and nasal discharge or nasal congestion in the infant by approximately 47% when compared with placebo (90676). However, it is unclear if these symptoms are due to atopy or infections. One clinical trial shows that taking DHA 1.9 grams from capsules providing fish oil 2.4 grams, starting in early pregnancy and continuing until 6 months postpartum, does not reduce the odds of the child developing atopic eczema, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, recurrent wheezing, asthma, or food allergy at 12 or 24 months of age when compared with placebo (112465). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPopulation research suggests that adipose tissue levels of DHA are not associated with a decreased risk of atrial fibrillation (90700). However, clinical research suggests that taking 2 grams per day of a combination of DHA plus EPA (2:1 ratio), starting 7 days before cardiac surgery and continuing until hospital discharge, reduces the relative risk of post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation by 72% when compared with placebo. These patients also received vitamin C 1 gram daily plus vitamin E 400 IU daily, starting 2 days prior to surgery and continuing until discharge (90701).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for autism.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking DHA 200 mg daily for 6 months does not improve autism symptoms in children and may even worsen some behaviors (90713). Another preliminary clinical study in children and adults with autism shows that taking a specific product (SUNTGA40S, Aravita, Suntory Ltd) containing DHA, arachidonic acid, and astaxanthin daily for 16 weeks does not improve overall symptoms when compared with placebo, although the combination product may improve certain symptoms such as social withdrawal or social communication (90716).\nless\nBehcet disease. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for Behcet disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for bipolar disorder in adults.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking DHA 1250 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo in patients with bipolar disorder (103312).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for breast cancer treatment or prevention.\nPopulation research has found no association between dietary fatty acid intake, including DHA, and the risk of breast cancer (96528). The effect of DHA supplementation on breast cancer risk is unknown.\n\nSome early research has investigated the effects of DHA in patients with breast cancer. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking DHA (DHASCO, Martek Biosciences Corp.) 600 mg three times daily for 7-10 days prior to chemotherapy initiation, and then for 5 months during chemotherapy, induces complete or partial response in 44% of breast cancer patients. Patients with a greater increase in DHA levels (at least 2.5%) show a longer time to progression and longer survival when compared to those with a smaller increase in DHA levels (90671).\nless\nBreath-holding attacks. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for reducing breath-holding attacks in children.\nClinical research in treatment-naïve children 5 months to 6 years of age with breath-holding attacks shows that taking oral DHA 150 mg/kg with piracetam 100 mg/kg daily for 6 months modestly reduces the frequency of attacks and increases the proportion of patients with complete resolution when compared with piracetam alone. These improvements did not appear until at least 3 months of use (112748).\nless\nCancer. Taking oral DHA with oral eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) does not seem to decrease the risk of cancer in patients with cardiovascular disease and may actually INCREASE the risk of cancer in females. The effect of DHA alone is unclear.\nClinical research suggests that taking a combination of EPA 400 mg plus DHA 200 mg, with or without B vitamins, for a median of 4.7 years does not reduce the risk of cancer in middle-aged and elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, this combination appears to increase the risk of cancer in females (90666).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for child development. However, due to the lack of significant safety concerns and the possibility of some cognitive benefit, many experts recommend DHA 200 mg daily during pregnancy.\nClinical research shows that giving infants DHA-supplemented formula during infancy does not appear to improve language and school readiness by the age of 2-3.5 years, or improve neurodevelopment by the age of 6 years (90674, 92503). In addition, most research suggests that DHA supplementation during pregnancy, occasionally continuing postpartum for 6 months, does not affect visual acuity, attention, working memory, behavior and most other measures of neurodevelopment by 1-7 years of age (48095, 48285, 48293, 90679, 90690, 94600, 96522, 109219). There is some evidence to suggest that maternal supplementation with DHA 400 mg daily from 16 weeks gestation until delivery may reduce the risk of poor language development in the infant at age 14 and 18 months and the risk of lower visual acuity at 2 months when compared with placebo (90694); however, this benefit did not have lasting effects at 5-6 years of age (99133).\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for child growth.\nA secondary analysis of clinical research in overweight or obese adults shows that taking DHA 800 mg daily, alone or with diet and physical activity counseling, from less than 15 weeks' gestation until delivery, modestly reduces weight-for-length and body mass index-for-age scores, but not weight- or length-for-age scores, in the offspring at 4 months of age when compared with taking DHA 200 mg daily (114310).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for cognitive impairment in older adults.\nClinical research shows that taking DHA 800 mg daily, alone or with folic acid 800 mcg daily for 6 months, modestly improves some measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (103978). Also, taking a specific product (Vayacog, Enzymotec Ltd.) providing phosphatidylserine 300 mg, DHA about 59 mg, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) about 20 mg daily for 15 weeks improves verbal immediate recall when compared with placebo (94665).\n\nHowever, other research in older patients with mild cognitive impairment disagrees. Several clinical studies show that taking DHA 720-3300 mg plus EPA 351-1200 mg daily and other ingredients such as cocoa for 12 weeks to 12 months does not improve cognitive measures including memory and forgetfulness when compared with placebo (62847, 90704, 94665, 109220, 111453). One moderate-sized clinical study in older adults with subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment shows that taking DHA 1.1 grams and EPA 0.4 grams 3 times daily with high-flavanol cocoa for 12 months moderately worsens reaction time variability, executive function, and alertness when compared with placebo. Additionally, there is no evidence of benefit on brain volumes, and those taking DHA-rich fish oil and cocoa had a greater decrease in cortical volume at 12 months when compared with placebo (111453).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for CHD.\nIncreased dietary consumption of DHA may reduce the risk of death in patients with CHD (10322). However, the effect of DHA supplements is unclear.\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for Crohn disease prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that increased dietary intake of DHA is associated with a reduced risk of Crohn disease (90673).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for dementia prevention.\nPopulation research has found that a 0.1 gram per day increment of dietary DHA intake is associated with a 14% reduced risk of dementia when taken for 2-21 years. However, a dose-response relationship was not seen, and a correlation between DHA blood concentration and dementia was not seen (96527).\nless\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in children with DCD shows that taking a tuna fish oil product providing DHA 480 mg daily for 4 months, in combination with evening primrose oil providing arachidonic acid 35 mg and gamma-linolenic acid 96 mg, thyme oil 24 mg, and vitamin E 80 mg (Efalex, Efamol Ltd.), modestly decreases movement disorders as determined by objective measures when compared with baseline (5708). It is unclear if these benefits are due to DHA, other ingredients, or the combination. Also, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for glycemic control or the prevention of type 1 or gestational diabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking DHA orally does not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or decrease blood sugar or glycated hemoglobin. However, triglyceride levels are reduced (10321).\n\nDHA has also been evaluated for the prevention of gestational or type 1 diabetes. Clinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking DHA (S-oil, DSM Nutritional Products) 800 mg daily, starting before 15 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, with or without dietary counselling, does not reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with taking DHA 200 mg daily (109218). Additionally, population research suggests that maternal serum levels of DHA are not associated with the risk of childhood onset of type 1 diabetes (90705).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diabetic macular edema related to diabetic retinopathy receiving ranibizumab shows that taking a combination supplement containing DHA 1050 mg daily along with other free fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins (Brudyretina, Brudy Lab S.L.) for 2 years reduces macular thickness, but not visual acuity, when compared with ranibizumab alone. The effect of DHA alone is unknown (96526).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if infant formula containing DHA is beneficial for diarrhea prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that giving full-term infants formula with added DHA 17 mg/100 kcal and arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) as needed for 12 months reduces the incidence of diarrhea requiring medical attention when compared to control formulas (92505).\nless\nDyslexia. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for improving night vision in children with this condition.\nOne small clinical study in children with dyslexia shows that taking fish oils rich in DHA, providing 480 mg daily for one month, seem to develop significantly better dark adaptation when compared with controls (5708).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nFractures. Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing DHA 660 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 330 mg, for 3 years does not prevent fractures in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in older adults with glaucoma shows that taking DHA 1.5 grams 3 times daily with citicoline for 3 months reduces the amount and rate of visual field loss and improves visual field index but does not reduce intraocular pressure when compared to baseline (112236). It is unclear if these effects are due to DHA, citicoline, or the combination; however, since no effects were found in the groups administered DHA or citicoline alone, it is possible that the effects are due to the combination of ingredients. The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a control group and the very small sample size.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for reducing blood pressure in adults or if prenatal supplementation reduces blood pressure in children.\nClinical research shows that taking DHA-enriched canola oil containing 63% oleic acid and 6% DHA for 4 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by 3% and diastolic blood pressure by 4% when compared to baseline in adults with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (26466). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with dyslipidemia shows that supplemental DHA reduces diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure when compared with control (102389). A large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing DHA 660 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 330 mg, for 3 years does not reduce blood pressure levels in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly. About 39% of the individuals included in this study were diagnosed with hypertension and about 50% were using antihypertensives (104619). The effect of DHA alone on blood pressure levels in a population of adults with diagnosed hypertension is unclear.\n\nPrenatal supplementation with DHA has also been evaluated for the prevention of hypertension in children. A secondary analysis of a large clinical trial shows that overweight children or children with obesity whose mothers took DHA 600 mg daily, starting at about 14.5 weeks' gestation and continuing until birth, have lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure at 5 years of age when compared with those whose mothers took placebo. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by about 4 mm Hg and 5 mm Hg, respectively, in the children exposed to DHA during pregnancy when compared with those exposed to placebo. The blood pressure of the children exposed to DHA during pregnancy was similar to that of children with normal weight (98891). Results of this study are limited by the fact that confounding factors, such as shorter duration of breast-feeding and increased sodium intake for children with obesity in the placebo group, may have also contributed to differences in blood pressure. It is unclear if this reduction in elevated blood pressure during childhood reduces the risk of hypertension in adulthood.\nless\nIgA nephropathy. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for IgA nephropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nInfant development. Infant supplementation with DHA does not seem to improve development. Also, most evidence shows that maternal supplementation with DHA is not beneficial for infant cognitive development. However, due to the lack of significant safety concerns and the possibility of some cognitive benefit, many experts recommend DHA 200 mg daily during pregnancy.\nMost clinical research shows that giving healthy, full-term infants formula supplemented with DHA 0.32% to 0.96% modestly improves measures of visual acuity at 2, 4, and 12 months of age when compared with standard infant formula (14403, 15003, 47980, 48355, 90670). However, formula supplemented with DHA 0.15% does not appear to improve visual acuity by about 12 months when given to preterm infants (48008). There is some evidence that giving healthy, full-term infants DHA-supplemented formula during infancy might improve language comprehension and development, as well as fine motor skills, by the age of 12-14 months when compared with standard formula (48247, 48356). However, most clinical research, including meta-analyses of high-quality clinical trials, shows that giving infants formula supplemented with DHA during infancy does not improve overall cognition or motor skills at 12-14 months of age, regardless of DHA dosing or prematurity status (48247, 48356, 89363).\n\nExperts generally recommend breast-feeding as the preferred feeding method over DHA-supplemented formula; however, if formula is used, some experts suggest a formula providing at least 0.2% of lipids from DHA (14403).\n\nSome population research suggests that higher maternal DHA levels are associated with improved use of gestures and problem solving in infants (90709, 99132). However, population research suggests that higher maternal DHA levels also appear to be associated with worsening mental development (90709), and most clinical research shows that maternal ingestion of DHA has little effect on fetal or infant development. Maternal ingestion of DHA 33-133 mg daily from an egg source or 400 mg daily from an algal-based source does not seem to significantly increase weight, length, or head circumference at birth (14395, 48286). Also, maternal ingestion of DHA 200-400 mg daily from week 15-22 of pregnancy until term does not significantly improve visual or auditory development in term infants (14393, 90706). A small clinical trial shows that taking DHA 1440 mg daily from fish oil also providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 260 mg, from 22-24 weeks gestation until delivery, does not improve most measures of developmental or behavioral milestones in the infant at 6 months, when compared with olive oil placebo (110354). In addition, most research suggests that DHA supplementation during pregnancy, occasionally continuing postpartum for 6 months, does not affect growth to age 18 months or visual acuity, attention, working memory, behavior and most other measures of neurodevelopment by 1-7 years of age (48095, 48285, 48293, 90679, 90690, 94600, 96522, 109219). However, there is some evidence to suggest that maternal supplementation with DHA 214 mg daily may improve infant sleep patterning on the first day of life (90687). Also, maternal supplementation with DHA 400 mg daily from 16 weeks gestation until delivery may reduce the risk of poor language development in the infant at age 14 and 18 months and the risk of lower visual acuity at 2 months when compared with placebo (90694). However, this benefit did not have lasting effects at 5-6 years of age (99133).\nless\nIntraventricular hemorrhage. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.\nPreliminary clinical research in infants born before 29 weeks gestation shows that supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 50 mg/kg and arachidonic acid 100 mg/kg (Formulaid, DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) until 36 weeks postmenstrual age has no effect on the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with a control emulsion (110356).\nless\nKeratoconus. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for improving vision in people with keratoconus.\nA small clinical trial in patients with early to advanced keratoconus shows that taking DHA 1000 mg daily for 3 months does not improve corneal thickness, measurements of corneal curve, or most other ophthalmological measures when compared with taking no DHA (110358).\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for preventing low birth weight.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking DHA 600 or 800 mg daily during gestation modestly reduces the risk of having a child with a low birth weight when compared with placebo. However, only 2 clinical trials were included in this analysis and a meta-analysis of 4 other clinical trials shows that taking DHA 400 mg daily is not beneficial for this purpose (114306).\nless\nLower respiratory tract infections. It is unclear if formula containing DHA is beneficial for preventing lower respiratory tract infections in infants.\nClinical research shows that giving preterm infants formula or breast milk containing high-dose DHA (1% of fatty acids) does not prevent hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis and other lower respiratory tract conditions when compared with giving breast milk or formula containing 0.35% DHA (90667). However, preliminary clinical research shows that giving full-term infants formula with added DHA 17 mg/100 kcal and arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) as needed for 12 months reduces the risk of bronchiolitis and croup when compared with control formulas (92505).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for improving fertility.\nClinical research shows that taking DHA (NuaDHA, Nua Biological Innovations SL) 0.5, 1, or 2 grams daily for 3 months increases progressive sperm motility by 24% to 30% when compared with placebo in men with a history of infertility. The greatest effects were seen in men with asthenozoospermia, with an overall effect of 35 (99134). It is unclear if the effects of DHA on sperm function correlate with increased fertility rates.\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for MASLD.\nClinical research in adults with MASLD shows that taking DHA (DHASCO, DSM Nutritional Products) 1.89 grams daily for 6 months, alone or with vitamin E 1000 mg daily, does not improve liver enzyme levels, glycemic indices, or hepatic steatosis severity when compared with placebo (114308). This study may have been inadequately powered or too short in duration to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nMigraine headache. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for migraine headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for increasing muscle strength.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing DHA 660 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 330 mg, for 3 years does not increase muscle strength in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for preventing NEC in preterm infants.\nClinical research in preterm infants shows that providing DHA (Neuromins for Kids life's DHA; DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) 75 mg/kg for 14 days from the first enteral feed reduces the risk of confirmed NEC by 7% when compared with a control oil. Treatment of 15 infants with DHA would be needed to prevent one case of NEC (109213). However, preliminary clinical research shows that maternal supplementation with DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, has no effect on the incidence of NEC in breastfed infants at 36 weeks postmenstrual age when compared with placebo (104559). Other preliminary clinical research in infants born before 29 weeks gestation shows that supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 50 mg/kg and arachidonic acid 100 mg/kg (Formulaid, DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) until 36 weeks postmenstrual age has no effect on the incidence of NEC when compared with a control emulsion (110356).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking DHA (Martek Biosciences Corporation) 250-500 mg daily for 6-24 months reduces the risk of severe liver steatosis when compared with placebo in children with NAFLD (48295, 90695, 90696).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for improving weight loss in overweight or obese adults.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking 2.8 grams daily of an oil emulsion containing approximately 46% DHA for 12 weeks decreases carbohydrate and fat intake, but does not reduce body weight or improve body composition, when compared with placebo in overweight or obese adults (90681).\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if DHA in infant formula is beneficial for preventing otitis media in infants.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that giving full-term infants formula with added DHA 17 mg/100 kcal and arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal (Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2, Mead Johnson Nutrition) for 12 months does not prevent the development of ear infection when compared with control formulas (92505).\nless\nPhenylketonuria (PKU). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for PKU.\nChildren with PKU consume very low amounts of DHA. Clinical research shows that taking DHA up to approximately 7 mg/kg daily for 6 months improves DHA status, but not neurological function, in children aged 5-13 years with PKU (99631). The effect of higher doses of DHA, or the effect of DHA supplementation on neurological function in younger children with PKU, have not been determined.\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for increasing physical performance in older adults.\nA large clinical study shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, providing DHA 660 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 330 mg, for 3 years does not improve physical performance in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo. These findings were consistent in adults taking omega-3 fatty acids alone or combined with vitamin D 2000 IU daily and/or strength training three times weekly (104619).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for reducing postoperative analgesic use.\nA post-hoc analysis shows that enteral DHA 75 mg/kg administered perioperatively to infants born at greater than 34 weeks gestation who are undergoing cardiac surgery reduces the cumulative analgesic dose and shortens the duration of buprenorphine during the postoperative period when compared with placebo. However, the use of fentanyl or ketorolac were not reduced (96524).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral DHA during lactation or in early infancy is beneficial for increasing growth or neurodevelopment of the premature infant.\nClinical research in lactating individuals who delivered prior to 29 weeks' gestation shows that taking DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery and continuing until the infant reached 36 weeks postmenstrual age, might have beneficial effects on the growth of female infants, but not male infants, when compared with placebo. Weight velocity and weight gain were significantly increased in the female infants, with a weight gain of 52.6 grams. However, weight gain and weight velocity were not improved in the male infants, and weight at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was 89 grams less than those whose mothers took placebo (109221). In addition, there was no improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months or 5 years corrected age (110364, 115171).\n\nOther clinical research in infants born before 29 weeks' gestation shows that giving enteral DHA 60 mg/kg daily until 36 weeks corrected gestational age does not improve most measures of intelligence at 5 years when compared with placebo (110363). However, a cohort study in premature infants born before 29 weeks' gestation suggests that supplementation with enteral high-dose DHA emulsion 60 mg/kg daily to match in-utero requirements until 36 weeks' gestational age or discharge home is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a 3.45 point benefit in intelligence quotient (IQ) at 5 years' corrected age. Further analysis of this relationship suggests that the increased risk effect of bronchopulmonary dysplasia from neonatal high-dose DHA is not associated with a decrease in the beneficial effects of DHA on IQ (112238).\nless\nPreterm labor. Most research shows that taking oral DHA during gestation does not prevent preterm labor. However, some research suggests that oral DHA may modestly reduce the risk of preterm labor in those with low DHA status at baseline.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking prenatal DHA 450-800 mg daily does not reduce the risk of preterm delivery when compared with placebo (114306). Also, one study shows that using a specific fish oil supplement (Incromega DHA 500TG) 900 mg containing DHA 800 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 100 mg daily, starting at 20 weeks' gestation and continuing to delivery or 34 weeks' gestation, does not reduce the risk of preterm delivery when compared with a vegetable oil control (101505). Another clinical trial shows that taking fish oil providing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg daily, starting before 20 weeks' gestation and continuing until 34 weeks' gestation, may actually increase the risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks' gestation when compared with placebo. In addition, taking fish oil had no effect on the risk of preterm birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation (103496).\n\nHowever, conflicting evidence exists in those with low DHA status at baseline. One clinical trial in in adults with baseline omega-3 status below 4.1% shows that taking fish oil providing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg daily, starting before 20 weeks' and continuing until 34 weeks' gestation, reduces the risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks' gestation from 3.2% to 0.7% when compared with placebo (103496). Also, clinical research shows that taking DHA 1000 mg daily during pregnancy, starting at 12-20 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, reduces the early preterm birth rate. In a large clinical trial, taking DHA 1000 mg daily is associated with an early preterm birth rate of 1.7%, compared with 2.4% in those taking DHA 200 mg daily. This study and secondary analyses show that benefits were strongest in those with low DHA status at baseline and in those with high adherence to DHA 1000 mg daily, with no benefit seen in those with high DHA status at baseline (109204, 110360, 114309). A secondary analysis of two studies shows that taking DHA 800 mg from algal oil or 1000 mg from fish oil modestly reduces the early preterm and preterm birth rates in those with a low DHA status at baseline when compared with taking DHA 200 mg (110361). The reasons for any discrepancies may be due to the baseline omega-3 status, the use of algal or fish oil as the source of DHA, the type of control oil, and/or the specific timing of preterm labor.\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for prostate cancer prevention.\nObservational research has found that higher consumption of DHA is associated with a reduced risk of total, advanced, and aggressive prostate cancer when compared to lower consumption of DHA (12961, 25937). However, a meta-analysis of multiple population studies has found that higher DHA blood levels are associated with a 2.5-fold higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but not low-grade prostate cancer, when compared with lower blood percentages of DHA (25936). Another meta-analysis of population research has found that a higher blood level of DHA is associated with a slight increased risk of non-aggressive prostate cancer (90677).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nRaynaud syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for Raynaud syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nRestenosis. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for preventing restenosis in people with stents.\nObservational research has found that initiation of statin therapy in patients receiving stent placement after an acute coronary event is associated with a reduction in DHA levels. These reductions in DHA are associated with a greater prevalence of in-stent restenosis. From these results, researchers postulate that patients newly started on a statin after stent placement for acute coronary syndrome might benefit from DHA supplementation (100939). However, the effect of DHA supplementation is unknown.\nless\nRetinitis pigmentosa. Evidence for the use of oral DHA for retinitis pigmentosa is inconsistent and contradictory.\nSome clinical research shows that taking DHA 1200 mg daily for 4 years does not improve eye function in patients with retinitis pigmentosa who are also taking vitamin A when compared with placebo (48070). Also, taking DHA 600-3600 mg daily for 4 years does not maintain rod or cone function in boys or men with retinitis pigmentosa when compared with placebo (90683). However, a report of ancillary outcomes from this study shows that taking DHA might slow the rate of decline in final dark-adapted thresholds and visual field sensitivity in these patients (95738). Also, some research shows that taking DHA 400 mg daily for 4 years does maintain rod and cone function in some patients, although visual function is not improved when compared with placebo (48057, 48115).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. It is unclear if maternal or infant supplementation with oral DHA is beneficial for preventing retinopathy of prematurity.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that maternal supplementation with DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks gestation, has no effect on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity in breastfed infants at 36 weeks postmenstrual age when compared with placebo (104559). Other preliminary clinical research in infants born before 29 weeks gestation shows that supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 50 mg/kg and arachidonic acid 100 mg/kg (Formulaid, DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) until 36 weeks postmenstrual age has no effect on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity when compared with a control emulsion (110356).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nSchizophrenia. Oral DHA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking EPA 1000 mg, DHA 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg twice daily for up to 2 years after discontinuing antipsychotic treatment does not prevent relapse in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder (90675).\nless\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for preventing sepsis in premature infants.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that maternal supplementation with DHA 1.2 grams daily, starting within 72 hours of delivery of infants born before 29 weeks gestation, has no effect on the incidence of sepsis in breastfed infants at 36 weeks postmenstrual age when compared with placebo (104559). Other preliminary clinical research in infants born before 29 weeks gestation shows that supplementation with an enteral emulsion containing DHA 50 mg/kg and arachidonic acid 100 mg/kg (Formulaid, DSM Nutritional Products Inc.) until 36 weeks postmenstrual age has no effect on the incidence of sepsis when compared with a control emulsion (110356).\nless\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for treating sickle cell disease.\nA very small clinical study in adults with sickle cell disease shows that eating mayonnaise enriched with DHA 1900 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) daily for 28 days does not reduce vaso-occlusive crisis pain or biomarkers of systemic inflammation (112237). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group and a very small sample size.\nless\nSpinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for SCA.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with SCA shows that taking DHA 600 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces ataxia and improves cerebellar hypometabolism upon brain imaging when compared with placebo. These beneficial effects are sustained when DHA is taken for an additional 40 weeks (96525).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral DHA is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nPopulation research has found that serum DHA levels may be associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, as well as any specific type of ischemic stroke, including cardioembolic stroke, atherothrombotic stroke, and lacunar stroke (90715).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for SLE, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for SLE nephritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. Although there has been interest in using oral DHA for ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of DHA for this condition.\nVascular dementia. It is unclear if DHA is beneficial for improving dementia severity.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with vascular dementia shows that taking DHA 0.72 grams daily for one year improves dementia severity based on the Hasegawa's Dementia Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination Scale scores when compared to baseline (47940).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate DHA for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDHA is typically used in doses of 400-800 mg daily for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nIn clinical research, studies have assessed DHA from DHA-rich fish oils providing 25% to 71% DHA (14393, 15495, 17735, 48013, 90667, 90679, 90691, 89353, 90691, 90704)(90708, 99131, 110357, 110361, 110363), or from algal sources containing 38.4% to 44% DHA (DHASCO, DSM Nutritional Lipids, formerly Martek Biosciences Corporation, or DHA RICHOIL capsules, Advance Food Research or DHA-S single cell oil) (90665, 90668, 90671, 90717).\nChildren\nOral:\nDHA is typically used in infant formula providing DHA 0.12% to 0.96% as a percentage of total fat content.

One specific algal DHA product DHASCO (DSM Nutritional Lipids, formerly Martek Biosciences Corporation) is prepared from oil from Crypthecodinium cohnii. The oil is deodorized, bleached, and diluted with high-oleic sunflower oil so that the resulting mixture contains 40% to 44% DHA. This source of DHA contains no EPA (90668, 90671). Another algal DHA product (DHA RICHOIL capsules, Advance Food Research) is administered as 600 mg capsules standardized to contain 38.4% DHA, 19.5% palmitic acid, 15.1% docosapentaenoic acid, 7.6% myristic acid, and other fatty acids (90665). Another algal source of DHA is DHA-S single cell oil, which is administered as 300 mg capsules prepared from Schizochytrium sp. oil. The product is standardized to contain 40% DHA, 1% EPA, 15% docosapentaenoic acid, ascorbyl palmitate 320 mg, mixed tocopherols 1.6 mg, and rosemary extract 2000 ppm (90717).\n\nOther studies have administered DHA-rich fish oils, including but not limited to tuna oil (15495, 17735, 48013, 90667, 90679, 90691, 89353, 90704, 90708, 99131)(110357, 110361, 110363). One specific tuna oil product (HiDHA, Clover Corp.) contains DHA 252 mg, EPA 60 mg, and vitamin E 10 mg, per 1000 mg oil (90708). This product (HiDHA supplied by Nu-Mega Ingredients) provided 135 mg DHA and 35 mg EPA per 500 mg capsule (99131). Another fish oil product (ProDHA, Nordic Naturals Corporation) contains DHA 450 mg and EPA 90 mg per 1 gram of oil (90691, 89353). Other fish oil capsules, including Incromega 5000TG (Croda Chemicals) and Marinol D40 (RP Scherer Limited), contain 40% to 71% DHA (14393, 48013, 90679).\n\nInfant formulas containing DHA have included Enfamil Premium 1 and Enfamil Premium 2 (Mead Johnson Nutrition), which contains DHA 17 mg/100 kcal and arachidonic acid 34 mg/100 kcal (92505); Aptamil with Milupan (Miulpa GmbH), which contains DHA 0.21 grams/100 grams fat and arachidonic acid 0.35 grams/100 grams fat; and Enfamil LIPIL (Mead Johnson Nutrition), which contains 0.32% DHA and 0.64% arachidonic acid (90670, 90674). Other infant formulas have contained DHA 0.12% to 0.36%, with or without arachidonic acid 0.27% to 0.72% (47980, 48008, 48356).",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the prevention or treatment of overdose with DHA.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing an acute dose of purified DHA in healthy adults, DHA incorporation into chylomicrons increases, peaking six hours after the meal, with rapid reduction (50% at eight hours) following that time period; uptake is estimated at 90% (48345). DHA status is commonly determined by measuring plasma phospholipid and red blood cell phospholipid DHA levels. However, DHA levels also increase in platelet and white blood cell phospholipids, as well as sperm plasma, following supplementation (1044, 11333, 14400, 47967, 47977, 48108, 48112, 48120, 48121, 48122)(48183, 48203, 48226, 48269, 104560, 110329). DHA absorption from algal oils, fish, and fortified foods appear to be similar (48176, 48220). However, ethyl ester sources may be less bioavailable than free fatty acid sources (48299).\nDistribution\nDHA levels are known to be high in tissues such as the brain and the retina (48315). Although neurons are not able to synthesize DHA, they do accumulate it when it is released from other cells in vitro, such as astrocytes (47989). In human research, DHA supplementation increases DHA levels in rectal biopsy samples (48108) and cerebrospinal fluid (48290). In animal models, DHA appears to be carried to the brain mainly as part of lysophosphatidylcholine (47990). In humans, DHA is preferentially transferred to the infant with higher levels in cord blood vs. placenta vs. maternal blood levels (48022).\nMetabolism\nIn the elderly, 13C-DHA resulted in plasma incorporation, retroconversion to EPA (less than 10%), and beta-oxidation (48297).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is a long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. It has 22 carbons with six double bonds; the first double bond is three carbons from the methyl end of the molecule (hence omega-3) (12914). DHA is found in some types of marine microalgae, as well as the tissues of marine mammals and oily fish. It is also found in fish liver oils and in commercial fish oil products. DHA can be converted into EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) in humans (1044). Over the past 100 years, there has been a decrease in intake of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA. This is particularly true for Western-based diets, which are characterized by lower intake of fish and marine foods (7148, 47953, 47954, 47971). DHA cannot be synthesized de novo (without a precursor) by mammals. Its precursor, the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), is elongated and desaturated to form EPA (20:5n-3). DHA is then formed through 24 carbon intermediates and retroconversion to 22:6n-3 (48322).\nAnti-aggression effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that DHA may reduce aggression in healthy men, possibly by reducing norepinephrine and increasing ratio the of epinephrine to norepinephrine (47937, 47961).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnti-inflammatory effects associated with DHA may be at least partially related to its metabolites. These include the DHA-derived resolvins, such as resolvin D1 (48237). Laboratory research suggests that the mechanism of action of these resolvins may be due to effects on inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cells (48270, 48271). Other laboratory research suggests that DHA may directly inhibit fatty acid release from membranes or cyclooxygenases, thereby reducing the conversion of fatty acids to eicosanoids (48026, 48072, 48271). In laboratory research, the conversion of DHA to 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDohE) in the skin epidermis has anti-inflammatory effects (48302, 48329). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that DHA reduces serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), especially in those with dyslipidemia or with elevated baseline CRP levels (102389). However, some laboratory and clinical research suggests that DHA has less anti-inflammatory activity than EPA (48246, 102389). Also, although some human research suggests that DHA inhibits natural killer cell activity and levels of some inflammatory mediators (47941, 103978, 110358), the majority suggests that DHA may not impact inflammatory cell numbers or activity, or most inflammatory mediators (8718, 47987, 48002, 48341, 48353, 110358).\nAnticancer effects\nAlthough DHA is commonly taken to prevent certain types of cancer, the effects of DHA on cancer are unclear. Some laboratory research suggests that oxygenated derivatives of DHA may induce apoptosis of cancer cells (48074, 48206). However, clinical research in middle-aged and elderly adults with cardiovascular disease suggests that taking a combination of EPA and DHA does not reduce the risk of cancer and may even increase the risk in females (90666). Also, while some population research suggests that DHA levels in certain areas of the red blood cell membrane are associated with a decreased prostate cancer risk (6395), a meta-analysis of various population trials shows that increased blood levels of DHA are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (90677).\nCardiovascular effects\nDHA may reduce cardiovascular mortality risk by several mechanisms, including reducing blood lipids, blood coagulation, and blood pressure. However, the effects of DHA on blood lipids are mixed. DHA seems to reduce serum triglycerides. However, DHA does not increase total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the majority of studies, although it may increase HDL-2 cholesterol (1009, 1014, 6143, 48083, 48123, 48174, 90703). DHA does not seem to decrease total cholesterol and it might actually increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (6143, 48055, 48083, 48092, 48174).\n\nDHA also decreases blood viscosity and increases red blood cell deformability, which might protect against thrombosis (11111, 11112). Most studies suggest that DHA does not significantly affect platelet function, clotting factors, fibrinogen concentrations, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or tissue plasminogen activator activity (10323, 11112, 11113). However, some evidence suggests that DHA inhibits platelet aggregation (48020), especially in females (90697). Also, in human research, DHA supplementation increased activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), a component of the coagulation system that downregulates fibrinolysis in circulation (47965).\n\nDHA has been shown to reduce blood pressure in various clinical trials (26466, 47944). Although the mechanism is not clear, DHA appears to enhance dilation of blood vessels in hyperlipidemic men but not in healthy young adults (47975, 90703). According to animal research, DHA may alter heart rate and blood pressure by incorporating into cardiac lipids and altering heart function (48113, 48173, 48274).\nDHA status and needs during pregnancy\nDHA is present in human breast milk, but not in all standard infant formulas. Infants fed formulas lacking in DHA have lower plasma and cerebral cortex DHA levels than breast milk-fed infants. The clinical significance of this, if any, is unknown. There is also concern that pregnancy might cause long-term effects on the DHA stores in females. However, there is evidence that maternal DHA status probably normalizes within a year after pregnancy. There is no evidence to suggest an association with the number of completed pregnancies and DHA stores (8716).\n\nThere appears to be preferential transfer of DHA across the placenta, possibly due to effects on fatty acid transport proteins, FATP-1 and FATP-4 (48145, 48157, 48223). Maternal supplementation with DHA 200 mg/day starting at pregnancy week 15 or in the third trimester seems to increase DHA levels in the mother, but does not seem to significantly increase DHA levels in the infant (14393, 14394, 14396). However, larger maternal DHA doses of 1.2 to 2 grams per day seems to increase DHA levels in the infant (14401). Maternal DHA levels tend to significantly decline during the third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal DHA supplementation seems to decrease the DHA decline during the third trimester (14396). Some researchers think that small increases in DHA intake prior to or early in pregnancy may be more beneficial in terms of maternal levels of DHA and transfer to the infant vs. higher supplemental DHA levels later in pregnancy (48065). Maternal ingestion of DHA and other fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) does not seem to significantly alter human milk cytokines such as interleukin 1-beta, interleukin 6, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (14400).\nEffects on infant development\nThere is interest in using DHA supplements for early infant development. Some evidence suggests that infants that do not obtain DHA from breast milk or formula have delayed development of visual acuity compared to those that do receive an adequate amount of DHA (14403, 47992). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids make up a third of all lipids in brain grey matter (425). DHA is thought to be important for normal neural function and might play a key role in the structural development of neural and synaptic membranes (424, 425, 8704, 8705). There is preliminary evidence DHA might affect retinal, visual, learning, and memory function (8704, 8705, 8715, 47992). DHA accrues rapidly in the human brain during the third trimester of pregnancy and during the early postnatal period (8705). Accrual of DHA and other fatty acids at this time results in rapid brain tissue development and growth (14399). Inadequate availability of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA during fetal and infant development is thought to be a factor in development of behavioral, functional, and neurological disorders (14399, 14402). Higher plasma DHA levels in females during birth might also be associated with greater central nervous system maturity in newborns, based on sleep-wake patterns (14399). Since DHA accumulates in the human brain during the third trimester of pregnancy, preterm infants rely on postnatal food sources. However, levels of DHA in breast milk following a preterm pregnancy are lower than those found in term breast milk (110355).\nImmune effects\nOmega-3 fatty acids may have immunomodulatory effects. In humans, taking a DHA-rich oil decreases activation of T lymphocytes and mononuclear cells and decreases levels of inflammatory mediators (47955, 48056, 48215, 48218). However, taking a DHA-rich fish oil increases activity of neutrophils and monocytes in other human research (48129, 48226). The immune altering effects of DHA may be due to the composition of the cell membrane, as well as activity of the DHA-derived resolvins (48237). The differential effects of DHA may be due to slightly different supplements used in available research, as well as the specific endpoint used.\nNeurologic effects\nDHA has been investigated for its neurological effects in older children and adults. In healthy boys, DHA increases prefrontal cortex activation during sustained attention (48278). Taking DHA in fish oil also seems to improve the processing of information by the brain during cognitive tasks (109310). However, in children aged 7-12 years, taking DHA had no effect on levels of serum neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, or adrenocorticotropic hormone (104560). In animal research, acute DHA injection soon after a spinal cord injury, followed by addition of DHA in the diet, provides neuroprotective effects, including increased neuronal and glial cell survival possibly due to reduced activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (48187). Also, in animal research, administration of a combination of DHA, uridine, and choline increases the levels of synaptic membranes and dendritic spines in the brain (42260). Laboratory research suggests that the DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1 improves inflammatory signaling and neuronal dysfunction related to beta-amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta peptide neurobiology (48243, 48245, 48256, 48261). Laboratory and animal research also suggest that brain DHA levels regulate brain glucose uptake by affecting glucose transporters (48011, 48134, 48190). DHA may protect nervous system functioning by altering membrane phospholipid fatty acid levels and having an effect on intracellular and intercellular signaling, membrane physical properties (such as fluidity, phase transition temperature, bilayer thickness, lateral domains, neurotransmission, membrane-bound enzyme and ion channel activities), and gene expression (48054).\nOcular effects\nAccording to laboratory research, high DHA domains in retinal membranes are the preferred location of the light-sensitive G-protein coupled membrane receptor, rhodopsin (48240). Laboratory research suggests that the DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1 has anti-apoptotic effects in aging or degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptor cells (48124, 48182, 48196)."

Neuroprotective effects of dodder have been shown in vitro and in animal research. In vitro, dodder extract induced neuronal differentiation and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in PC12 cells, purportedly via a MAPK signaling pathway (48367). In psychologically stressed female rats, dodder flavonoids decreased beta-endorphin levels (beta-EP) in the hypothalamus and increased luteinizing hormone (LH) cell count and content in the anterior pituitary (48365).\nRenal effects\nDodder is traditionally used for urinary tract disorders. In an animal model of acute renal failure, dodder seed extract improved measures of renal function, such as urinary excretion rate and electrolyte levels, and reduced tubular damage (99158)."

The amount of these constituents in dong quai root can vary significantly from region to region. Ferulic acid content usually ranges from 0.2-1.4 mg/gram of dong quai root; ligustilide content ranges from 4-14 mg/gram of dong quai root (15107).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of dong quai.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of dong quai is the root. It contains several active constituents including ferulic acid, ligustilide, angelicide, brefeldin A, butylphthalide, nicotinic acid, succinic acid, angelica polysaccharide, and phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol (15107, 15109, 48500, 95427). Dong quai root contains a variety of other constituents including n-valerophenone-O-carboxylic acid, uracil, adenine, carvacrol, safrole, isosafrole, sesquiterpenes, n-dodecanol, n-tetradecanol, palmitic acid, angelic acid, myristic acid, and psoralens (15109, 10057, 48461). The dong quai root also contains vitamins and minerals including vitamin A, carotenoids, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin B12, biotin, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and potassium (10054, 15109, 48463, 48500, 48511). It also contains 0.4% to 0.7% volatile oil (10054, 15109). Dong quai also contains several coumarin constituents; however, there has been some debate about which coumarins are present. Those reported to be present include angelol, angelicone, osthol, psoralen, oxypeucedanin, and bergapten (10054, 15109).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLigustilide may have anti-inflammatory effects (48472). This may be due to inhibition of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin E2 production (10057). Angelica polysaccharide in dong quai inhibits the accumulation and release of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro (95427).\nAntiarrhythmic effects\nFerulic acid in dong quai is thought to have antiarrhythmic effects (15106, 15107). In research in rats, injecting dong quai during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion decreases arrhythmias (48465).\nAnticoagulant effects\nVarious compounds in dong quai, including ferulic acid, sodium ferulate, and coumarins such as ligustilide and osthol, are thought to have antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects (3526, 10057, 15106, 15107, 48454, 48499, 96137). Research in animals has demonstrated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by ligustilide, and a combination supplement containing dong quai has been shown to inhibit thrombus formation in rabbits (48488, 96137). However, clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking 1 gram of dong quai root daily for 3 weeks does not significantly inhibit platelet aggregation or cause bleeding (96137).\nAntihypertensive effects\nSome coumarins in dong quai, including osthol, can act as vasodilators, lowering blood pressure (10057). Coumarins may also alleviate pulmonary hypertension by antagonizing calcium as shown in animal research (48499, 10057). Animal research also suggests that dong quai may stimulate beta 2-receptors (48475).\nAntineoplastic effects\nDong quai appears to contain both carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic constituents. Components that may be carcinogenic include safrole, isosafrole, and bergapten (7162, 48495, 10054). Dong quai also contains a low molecular weight polysaccharide that shows anti-tumor activity in animals (10056). Laboratory research shows that dong quai inhibits skin and colon cancer cell proliferation (48464, 48490). Furanocoumarins from dong quai promote antitumor activity in cultured cells by stimulating macrophages, enhancing phagocytosis, and inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (48474). In mice, dong quai extracts have antitumor activity (37396, 48450, 48473).\nAntiplatelet effects\nDong quai is thought to inhibit platelet activation and aggregation (6048). Ferulic acid in the root has been shown in laboratory research to inhibit platelet aggregation by inhibiting synthesis of cyclooxygenase (COX) and thromboxane A2 (48499, 48508). However, in healthy volunteers taking dong quai 1 gram daily for 3 weeks, arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited in only 2 of 24 subjects. No effect was observed on platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, epinephrine, or ristocetin. Additionally, taking dong quai in combination with aspirin did not increase the antiplatelet effects of aspirin (96137).\nAntiulcer effects\nDong quai is thought to have antiulcer effects and has been used traditionally in ulcerative colitis. A crude extract of dong quai dose-dependently enhances gastric ulcer healing in rats and promotes wound repair in RGM-1 cells (48434). In animal research, dong quai polysaccharides have protective effects against gastrointestinal mucosal damage (48430).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary research suggests dong quai might protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury (9985). Prolongation of the effective refractory period and action potentials of guinea pig myocardium has also been demonstrated (48466). In other animal research, dong quai exhibits antinociceptive properties in retrograde injection of bradykinin into the carotid artery of rats (48480).\nDermatologic effects\nPsoralen and bergapten are components of dong quai that are photosensitizing and can cause severe photodermatitis (10057).\nGenitourinary effects\nA multi-ingredient preparation containing dong quai is thought to work in premature ejaculation by increasing the penile vibratory threshold and reducing the amplitude of penile somatosensory evoked potentials (2537).\nHematologic effects\nThere is a case report of a hemodialysis patient with anemia resistant to erythropoietin, who had an improvement in hemoglobin and hematocrit after consuming dong quai (48425). Additionally, laboratory research shows that dong quai polysaccharides may enhance hematopoiesis by stimulating macrophages, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes (48493, 48516).\nHepatologic effects\nResearch in mice shows that intragastric administration of a dong quai extract dose-dependently prevents liver toxicity induced by acetaminophen without affecting the serum acetaminophen concentration (48437).\nHormonal effects\nSome research suggests that dong quai root does not have estrogenic effects and therefore is not a phytoestrogen (738). However, other research suggests that it does have estrogenic effects (6180, 7860, 10979, 15535, 35915, 48459). A dong quai extract competitively inhibits estradiol binding to estrogen receptors and induces transcription activity in estrogen-responsive cells (6180, 48503). The ferulic acid constituent seems to have estrogenic activity. Ferulic acid stimulates proliferation of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells in vitro. It also appears to up-regulate transcription of the HER2 oncogene and ESR1 gene (15108). A water-soluble extract of dong quai stimulates proliferation of both estrogen-receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells in vitro. The effect on estrogen-receptor positive cells appears to involve estrogen agonist activity. The effect on estrogen-receptor negative cells is independent of estrogen (15535).\nImmunologic effects\nDong quai appears to have both immunostimulant and immunosuppressant effects (48476). A polysaccharide fraction from dong quai shows immunostimulant effects in vitro (10056, 48484). In contrast, oral and intraperitoneal administration of dong quai extract in mice has shown suppression of antibody production (48485). The angelica polysaccharide constituent inhibits the release of histamine and activation of mast cells in vitro (95427).\nPulmonary effects\nThe ligustilide constituent of dong quai is thought to have antispasmodic and antiasthmatic effects (15107).\nUterine effects\nAnimal and in vitro research shows that dong quai stimulates contractions of uterine smooth muscle (8142, 13400, 48517). However. other animal research shows that ferulic acid, a phenolic compound in dong quai, inhibits the smooth muscles of the uterus (48471)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the dragon fruit plant are the fruit, leaves, and flowers. Dragon fruit is rich in sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and oligosaccharides. The seeds contain various phenolics, sterols, tocopherols, and essential fatty acids, including linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids (93928). Dragon fruit also contains vitamin C (93929) and hydroxycinnamic acids (93933). Dragon fruit contains an arabinogalactan-like polysaccharide (93936). The peel of the fruit is a rich source of betacyanins, the terpenoid beta-amyrin, sterols, alkanes, octadecane, and trichloroacetic acid (93934, 93937). The betacyanins occur in the highest levels in the red peels, followed by the red flesh of the fruit. However, they are also found in smaller amounts in white peels and fruit (93938, 93939).\nAnti-obesity effects\nIn a high fat-induced animal obesity model, dragon fruit and the betacyanin constituents of the dragon fruit peel improved insulin resistance, adipose cell division, and hepatic steatosis (93935, 93937). The purified betacyanins from dragon fruit reduced body weight (93937), although dragon fruit itself did not alter body weight (93935). It is possible that the betacyanins modified the levels of some hormones involved in appetite (93937).\nAnticancer effects\nDragon fruit is traditionally used to prevent cancer. The peel of the fruit has anticancer effects in laboratory research, possibly related to the constituents beta-amyrin and beta-sitosterol (93934).\nAntidiabetic effects\nDragon fruit is traditionally used for diabetes. It has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in some preliminary human and animal studies (93932, 100957). The antidiabetic effects may be related to the antioxidant effects and free radical scavenging activity of dragon fruit, with the betacyanin constituents thought to impart the strongest antioxidant effects (100957). Purified betacyanins from dragon fruit peel have been shown to limit the development of insulin resistance by attenuating fibroblast growth factor-21 resistance in an animal model of obesity (93935). Dragon fruit has also been shown to prevent damage to pancreatic beta cells in an animal model of diabetes (100957).\nAntioxidant effects\nDragon fruit has demonstrated antioxidant effects in animal and laboratory research. It is possible that these antioxidant effects play a role in the potential clinical effects of dragon fruit (93932, 93934). However, compared to other traditional plants of South America, dragon fruit does not appear to be rich in antioxidant activity (93933). Betacyanins, found mainly in red peels or fruit flesh, appear to have the strongest antioxidant activity in laboratory research (93938).\nCardiovascular effects\nDragon fruit is traditionally used to prevent heart disease and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In an animal diabetic model, dragon fruit extract reduced systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure. Also, aortic stiffness was reduced (93932). In another animal model of obesity, isolated betacyanins from dragon fruit pulp reduced triglyceride and cholesterol plasma levels (93937).\nErgogenic effects\nIn a rat model of exercise, an alcoholic extract of red dragon fruit given 30 minutes prior to heavy physical exercise decreases lactic acid levels and creatine kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (105847).\nWound healing effects\nThe dragon fruit plant is used traditionally for wound healing. In animals, topical extracts of the fruit pulp, flowers, and leaves improved wound healing and epithelialization. Extracts of the leaves and flowers also helped to reduce inflammation in the wounds. The fruit rind was the least active portion of the plant (93931)."

Other constituents include cyclopentane fatty acids, apiogalacturonan polysaccharides, and cardenolides (18).\nNutritional effects\nDuckweed is a good source of protein, although it is not digested or absorbed as well as the protein found in peas. This may be due to the presence of trypsin inhibitors, calcium oxalate, tannins, and phytates in duckweed (101479). Blood glucose and insulin levels are also lower after ingestion of duckweed compared to peas, probably due to its lower sugar content (1.2% compared with 18.9% for peas) (101479).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nDulse is a type of red seaweed rich in potassium, iodine, and protein. The composition of dulse is dependent on various factors, including growing and storage conditions. Potassium concentrations in dulse range from 22.2-122 mg/gram dry weight (103317). Although most measurements indicate iodine levels of less than 100 mcg/gram, levels as high as 712 mcg/gram have been reported. Iodine levels may be related to the season, water temperature, water salinity, and storage conditions after harvest (103323). Dulse contains up to 22% protein, with levels and amino acid concentrations varying by season. However, digestibility is low (103318). One example of a protein in dulse is phycoerythrin (103324).\n\nDulse also contains various polyphenols, including 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid (103316, 103320). Floridoside, a heteroside, is found in levels of up to 25% dry weight depending on the season and location (103315). Dulse contains low levels of the fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and fiber (103316, 103323). Dulse also contains kainic acid at variable levels of up to 10,000 mcg/gram dry weight. Recently, levels of up to 560 mcg/gram dry weight were found in commercial European samples (103321).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nDulse phenolic constituents are of interest for pathogenic states involving inflammation. In vitro, a dulse extract rich in phenolics inhibited the overstimulation of neutrophils by a mechanism related to the decreased expression of TLR4 mRNA. There was a decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (103316). However, it is not clear whether anti-inflammatory effects can be attributed to dulse itself. In human research, consuming dulse 5 grams daily in bread had no effect on most inflammatory markers. Rather, there was an increase in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) by about 16%, as well as an increase in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 (103315).\nLipid effects\nAlthough dulse is of interest for lowering blood lipid levels, taking dulse does not seem to benefit cholesterol or triglyceride levels in most research (103323). In addition, some research suggests that dulse might increase triglyceride levels, possibly by altering lipid storage in adipocytes (103315)."
