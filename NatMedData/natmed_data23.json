            "Overview": "Valerian is an herbaceous perennial plant with feather-like leaves and small flowers that are white to pink in color. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has also been cultivated in North America (81723). Valerian can grow to be just over 6 feet tall and is characterized by a strong odor (81723). Valerian root has a long history of use, dating back to use as a sedative by the ancient Greeks and Romans (56982).",
            "Warnings": "Several vaping products with labels claiming to contain valerian root have been found to contain measurable quantities of synthetic cannabinoids (114797).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Valerian 300-600 mg daily has been safely used in clinical studies in over 12,000 patients for up to 6 weeks (2074, 3484, 3485, 4032, 15018, 17577, 17578, 19409, 96242, 103221)(104010, 105718).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of valerian when used orally for longer than 6 weeks.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Valerian 160-320 mg has been used with apparent safety in children under 12 years of age for 4-8 weeks (14416).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, valerian is generally well-tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dizziness, drowsiness, and mental slowness. Other reported side effects include headache, gastrointestinal upset, excitability, and vivid dreams. When used chronically and abruptly stopped, symptoms of withdrawal such as tachycardia, anxiety, irritability, and insomnia might occur. Advise patients to taper doses slowly after extended use.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Several case reports raise concerns about hepatotoxicity after the use of valerian and valerian-containing multi-ingredient dietary supplements. Withdrawal from chronic valerian use has been associated with cases of cardiac failure and hallucinations.\nCardiovascular\nWhen used orally in high doses for an extended period of time, valerian withdrawal has been associated with tachycardia and high output cardiac failure in one patient with a history of coronary artery disease (3487). Chest tightness has been reported for an 18-year-old female who took 40-50 capsules containing valerian 470 mg/capsule (659). A case of severe hypotension, suspected to be due to vasodilation, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, has been reported for a patient who injected an unknown quantity of a crude tap water extract of raw valerian root (81734). A case of transient complete atrioventricular block and QT prolongation was reported in a 25-year-old female following the post-workout use of a specific product (Muscle Eze Advanced) containing valerian and several other ingredients. Symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness started 1 week into use of the product; discontinuation led to restoration of normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours and normalization of the electrocardiogram within 2 weeks (112556). It is unclear whether this event was due to valerian, other ingredients, the combination, or other factors.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, valerian might rarely cause a rash. A case of valerian-related rash that resolved after valerian root discontinuation was reported in clinical research (19422).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, valerian has been associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain (15046, 19406, 19407, 19422, 110712). In one individual, taking 20 times the normal dose caused abdominal cramping (659).\nless\nHepatic\nThere have been several case reports of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of multi-ingredient oral preparations containing valerian (8243, 96241). In one case report, a 57-year-old man presented with acute hepatitis after consuming a cold and flu remedy containing valerian 2 grams for 3 days; the remedy also contained white willow, elderberry, and horseradish. Although the use of the cold and flu remedy was discontinued one month prior to symptom presentation, the acute hepatitis was attributed to valerian root and treated with steroids (96241). It is possible, however, that some of these preparations may have been adulterated with hepatotoxic agents (8243).\n\nHepatotoxicity involving long-term use of single-ingredient valerian preparations has also been reported (3484, 17578). Also, a case of a 38-year-old female with liver insufficiency and cirrhosis of a vascular parenchymal nature who developed hepatotoxic symptoms following valerian and ethyl-alcohol abuse has been reported (81697). Symptoms resolved and laboratory values normalized following intense plasmapheresis treatment. Another case of acute hepatitis characterized by elevated aminotransferases, mild fibrosis, and liver inflammation has been reported for a 50-year-old female who consumed valerian root extract 5 mL three times weekly along with 10 tablets of viamine, a product containing dry valerian extract 125 mg/tablet, for 2 months (81696). Because a variety of doses were used in these cases, and many people have used higher doses safely, these hepatotoxic reactions might have been idiosyncratic. Tell patients the long-term effect of valerian on liver function is unknown.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn a case report, combined intake of valerian and passionflower caused throbbing and muscular fatigue when taken concomitantly with lorazepam (19429).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, valerian might cause dizziness, headaches, fatigue, sleepiness, and mental dullness (3484, 17578, 19411, 19422, 81723, 89407). The severity of adverse effects appears to increase with higher doses (19411). However, taking valerian extracts in doses up to 1800 mg does not appear to significantly affect mood or psychomotor performance (10424, 15044). Valerian does not usually have a negative impact on reaction time, alertness, and concentration the morning after intake (2074, 8296). Clinical research shows that a single dose of valerian root 1600 mg is not associated with any changes in sleepiness, reaction time, or driving performance within 1-4 hours after intake (96240). More serious side effects may occur when valerian is taken at higher doses. In one individual, 20 times the normal dose caused tremor of the hand and foot and lightheadedness (659). In a case report, combined intake of valerian and passionflower caused shaking of the hands and dizziness when taken concomitantly with lorazepam (19429).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, valerian has been associate with reports of restlessness, excitability, uneasiness, agitation, and vivid dreams (3484, 17578, 19411, 19422). Chronic use and rapid cessation can lead to withdrawal syndrome with symptoms of agitation, insomnia, and hallucinations (104003). There appears to be a trend towards increased severity of adverse effects with higher doses (19411). A case of acute hypomania has been reported for a 21-year-old female patient who took a valerian decoction in water each night for one month to treat subclinical anxiety. Symptoms included euphoric mood, rapid speech, and increased sociability and sexual interest. Following cessation of valerian use and treatment with quetiapine 100 mg daily for two weeks, the patient recovered (89405). In another case report, an 85-year-old male with mild cognitive impairment, major depression, anxiety, and chronic kidney disease presented to the emergency department with hallucinations, confusion, and agitation thought to be due to abrupt cessation after taking valerian 600 mg daily for about 6 months. The symptoms resolved in about 5 days (104003).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nInsomnia. Most research shows that taking valerian whole root extract 300-600 mg daily modestly improves subjective sleep quality, although it might take up to 4 weeks to provide benefit. Valerian does not seem to improve sleep latency, sleep duration, or insomnia severity.\nAlthough there is a great deal of conflicting research, overall, taking valerian 300-600 mg before bedtime seems to improve sleep quality when compared with placebo. In contrast, no consistent benefit has been seen for sleep latency, sleep duration, or insomnia severity (15046, 17577, 19406, 19409, 104010), although one small clinical trial disagrees (114801). Older meta-analyses show that valerian root improves sleep quality regardless of its formulation. However, the most recent meta-analysis shows that valerian whole root extract improves sleep quality, while it's unclear whether an unspecified valerian extract is effective (17577, 19406, 104010). These analyses are limited by significant heterogeneity in valerian dosage and formulation, treatment duration, and included patient populations. Some experts claim that valerian does not work acutely for sleep, and it can take up to 4 weeks for a benefit to be seen (10209, 104010). Indeed, most short-term studies assessing valerian as a single dose, or used daily for up to one week, show no benefit for sleep quality when compared with placebo (19407, 19408, 19411, 19414), although one small study disagrees (114801). However, a meta-analysis of studies lasting 4 weeks or longer also did not find a consistent benefit (104010).\n\nThe benefits of valerian for sleep might vary in different patient populations. A large post-marketing surveillance study in children with restlessness or dyssomnia under the age of 12 has found that taking a specific combination product (Euvegal Forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) containing valerian root extract 160 mg and lemon balm extract 80 mg 1-2 tablets once or twice daily is associated with moderate sleep improvement (14416). Also, one clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking valerian root extract 530 mg (Sadamine) twice daily for 28 days moderately improves sleep quality when compared with placebo (19425). Another clinical study in patients undergoing treatment for cancer shows that taking valerian 450 mg 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks does not improve objective sleep measures, but might improve subjective sleep ratings and mood, when compared with placebo (19424). Small clinical studies in adults on hemodialysis show that taking valerian 530 mg before bedtime for 1 month improves sleep quality when compared with baseline or placebo. (105718, 110712). In one of these studies, improvements in sleep quality were similar when compared with gabapentin (110712).\n\nResearch also shows that taking specific combination products containing valerian and other ingredients can improve sleep quality. These combination products have combined valerian with hops; lemon balm (Euvegal Forte); lemon balm and hops (Valerina Natt); or passionflower and hops (NSF-3, M/s Tablets India) (10423, 15018, 19413, 19417, 19418, 19419, 88193, 89408).\n\nFinally, limited research has compared valerian to benzodiazepines. A small clinical study in patients with non-organic insomnia shows that taking valerian extract (LI 156, Sedonium) 600 mg daily for 6 weeks seems to be no different for improving sleep quality when compared with taking low-dose oxazepam 10 mg (19416). Valerian might also improve sleep quality in patients who are resistant to chronic benzodiazepine therapy. In one small study, after tapering the benzodiazepine over two weeks, valerian extract 100 mg three times daily for 15 days improves sleep quality when compared with placebo (8006).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. It is unclear if valerian is beneficial for anxiety.\nMeta-analyses of heterogeneous clinical research show that there is insufficient and contradictory evidence on the use of valerian root for anxiety (104010, 110711). However, one analysis suggests that using whole root preparations seems to have greater efficacy than valerian extracts (104010). These meta-analyses are limited by significant heterogeneity in valerian dosage and formulation, treatment duration, and patient populations and concerns related to publication bias (104010, 110711).\n\nOne small clinical study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) shows that taking valerian extract containing 81.3 mg valepotriates daily for 4 weeks is no different for reducing anxiety scores when compared with diazepam 6.5 mg or placebo (9896). This study was not adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Also, a small, quasi-randomized trial in adults with poor sleep quality who are undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking a specific valerian root product (Sedamin, Goldaru Company) 530 mg daily for 1 month improves anxiety scores by 2-3.9 times when compared with placebo. However, not all patients reported anxiety at baseline (105718).\n\nIn contrast, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination of herbal extracts containing valerian root, passionflower, ballota, and hawthorn (Euphytose) daily for 14 days reduces subjective anxiety and objective sympathetic and autonomic nervous system activation in response to a psychosocial stressor when compared with placebo (111222). It is unclear if these effects are due to valerian, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDelirium. Oral valerian has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with agitation and delirium receiving quetiapine 50-200 mg every 12 hours shows that taking 5 mL of syrup containing valerian root 625 mg and an extract of lemon balm leaf 50 mg every 12 hours improves agitation from baseline similarly to placebo. It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups (106627).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if valerian is beneficial in patients with depression.\nA retrospective case series in patients with mild to moderate depression and reports of anxiety has found that taking high-dose valerian 1000 mg with St. John's wort is associated with more rapidly improved depressive symptoms than low-dose valerian 500 mg with St. John's wort (19402). The validity of this study is limited by its retrospective nature and small size. Also, it is unclear if this effect is due to valerian, St. John's wort, or the combination. One small, quasi-randomized trial in adults with poor sleep quality who are undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking a specific valerian root product (Sedamin, Goldaru Company) 530 mg daily for 1 month improves depression scores by 2-3.9 times when compared with placebo. However, not all patients reported depression at baseline (105718).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. One small study suggests that oral valerian may reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea.\nA small clinical study shows that taking powdered valerian root 255 mg three times daily for two menstrual cycles reduces pain severity associated with menstruation when compared with placebo (19342).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Small studies suggest that oral valerian may reduce menopausal symptoms.\nTwo small clinical studies in postmenopausal adults show that taking valerian root (Zardband or Goldaroo Co.) 225 mg three times daily or 530 mg twice daily for 2 months moderately reduces hot flash frequency and severity when compared with placebo (89407, 96243). Another small study in adults with menopausal symptoms shows that taking a combination of valerian and fennel extracts 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity of hot flashes and improves sleep quality but does not reduce the duration or frequency of hot flashes when compared with control (112369). It is unclear if these effects are due to valerian, fennel, or the combination. All 3 studies were conducted in Iran, so it is unclear if these results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). One small study suggests that oral valerian may reduce PMS symptoms.\nA small clinical study in young adults with PMS shows that taking valerian root extract (Goldaroo Co.) 530 mg twice daily on the last 7 days of the menstrual cycle for 3 cycles moderately reduces the severity of self-reported PMS symptoms when compared with placebo (96239).\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. Two small studies suggests that oral valerian may reduce anxiety during wisdom tooth extraction.\nA small crossover study in adults undergoing impacted mandibular molar extraction shows that taking valerian extract (Dermatologica Ltda.) 100 mg one hour prior to the extraction reduces physiological responses to anxiety to a satisfactory but lesser degree than midazolam 15 mg. Patients expressed no clear preference for either valerian or midazolam for reducing perioperative anxiety (102242). The validity of these findings is limited by the use of subjective outcome measures. Another small clinical trial in adults undergoing tooth extraction shows that taking valerian 400 mg orally one hour prior to the procedure reduces anxiety scores when compared to baseline. The placebo group did not exhibit a reduction from baseline anxiety scores; however, there was no direct comparison between groups, limiting the interpretability of this finding (114800).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral valerian is beneficial in patients with RLS.\nA small clinical study in patients with RLS shows that taking valerian (Pharmavite, LLC) 800 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve RLS symptoms or sleep latency when compared with placebo (19422). However, this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in RLS symptoms between groups. Conversely, another small clinical study in adults with RLS on hemodialysis shows that taking valerian 530 mg nightly before bed for 1 month reduces symptoms of RLS when compared to baseline; however, valerian's effects were weaker when compared with gabapentin 100 mg nightly (110712). The validity of this study is limited by a lack of a placebo group and a small sample size.\nless\nStress. Two small studies suggest that oral valerian may reduce the stress response in healthy adults who are performing a stressful mental task or a verbal presentation.\nTwo small clinical studies in healthy volunteers shows that taking valerian 100 mg once or 600 mg daily for 7 days prior to participating in a mental stress task or public verbal test reduces physiologic responses to stress and feelings of anxiety when compared to baseline (9893, 9895). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the control group. Another small study in healthy volunteers shows that taking a specific combination product containing valerian 360 mg and lemon balm 240 mg (Songha Night, Pharmaton Natural Health Products) reduces anxiety associated with laboratory-induced stress. However increasing the dose to valerian 1080 mg and lemon balm 720 mg seems to increase anxiety (19405).\nless\nTension headache. One small study suggests that oral valerian may reduce tension headache.\nA small clinical study in patients with frequent tension headaches shows that taking valerian root extract (Sedamin, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 1060 mg daily after dinner for one month modestly reduces headache severity and disability when compared with placebo (103221).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate valerian for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nValerian has been used in daily divided doses of 1215 mg for up to 7 days. Valerian has most often been used in doses of 300-600 mg daily for up to 6 weeks. It is frequently found in combination products with other sedative herbs such as hops, passionflower, and lemon balm. Prolonged use might result in dependence, and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation (17577, 103221, 104010). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSome valerian products are standardized based on the valerenic acid constituent. Most clinical studies do not specify the valerenic acid content of the valerian extracts used. However, some products containing valerian root extract have been standardized to contain 0.683% to 1% valerenic acid (10424, 15046). Similarly, some products containing ground valerian root have been standardized to contain 0.15% to 0.8% valerenic acid (19422, 19424).\n\nSpecific products containing valerian root or valerian root extract that have been used in clinical research include: Sedamin 530 mg (19425, 105718); Valerina Forte (Cederroth International AB) 200 mg (19409); Valdispert forte (19415); a valerian root extract called Li 156 (Sedonium, Lichtwer Pharma) 300 mg or 600 mg (6249, 19411, 19416); and Valmane (Whitehall Pharmaceutical) 100 mg (8006).",

Theoretically, valerian might have an additive sedative effect when combined with alcohol. Excessive sedation has been reported in an alcohol-abusing individual who took valerian and Gingko biloba (19426). However, the potential interaction between valerian and alcohol has been disputed in other research. Limited evidence suggests that a combination of valerian 160 mg and lemon balm 80 mg (Euvegal) does not cause further deterioration in reaction ability and reaction rate when taken with alcohol as compared to the effects of alcohol alone (19427).\nless\nALPRAZOLAM (Xanax)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nValerian can have additive sedative effects when used with alprazolam.

Theoretically, valerian might cause additive sedation when combined with alprazolam. Also, a small pharmacokinetic study shows that taking valerian extract 1000 mg daily (providing 11 mg valerenic acid) might increase alprazolam levels by about 19%. This might be due to valerian's mild inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (13014). Despite being statistically significant, this increase is not likely to be clinically significant.\nless\nCNS DEPRESSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nValerian can have additive sedative effects when used concomitantly with CNS depressant drugs.\nTheoretically, concomitant use of valerian and drugs with sedative and anesthetic properties may cause additive therapeutic and adverse effects (3486, 12720, 19429).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nValerian does not seem to have a clinically relevant effect on levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.\nAlthough some in vitro evidence suggests that valerian affects CYP2D6, clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies show that valerian is unlikely to affect the CYP2D6 enzyme (13014, 13536, 19430, 19431). In one PK study, taking valerian 1000 mg (providing about 11 mg valerenic acid) nightly for 14 days did not affect the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 substrate. In another PK study, taking valerian 125 mg three times daily for 28 days did not affect metabolism of debrisoquine, an accepted CYP2D6 probe-substrate (13014, 13536).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nValerian does not seem to have a clinically relevant effect on levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nAlthough some in vitro and animal evidence suggests that valerian extract might inhibit or induce CYP3A4, clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies show that valerian does not have a clinically significant effect on the CYP3A4 enzyme (6450, 12214, 13014, 13536, 19431, 111404, 114799). In one PK study, taking valerian 125 mg three times daily for 28 days did not affect metabolism of midazolam, an accepted CYP3A4 probe-substrate. In another PK study, taking valerian 1000 mg (providing about 11 mg valerenic acid) nightly for 14 days modestly increases levels of alprazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, suggesting mild inhibition of CYP3A4 (13014, 13536).

A psychiatric consultation revealed agitation and paranoia, delayed thinking, and mostly normal cognition; the patient was diagnosed with encephalitis due to accidental overdose. Self-treatment was discontinued and the patient was restarted on carbamazepine, with mental status returning to baseline by the third day (108064).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with valerian.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing a 600 mg oral dose of a specific valerian extract (Sedonium, Lichtwer Pharma) in healthy volunteers, maximum valerenic acid serum concentrations of 0.9-2.3 ng/mL usually occur within 1-2 hours (14405).\nExcretion\nFollowing a 600 mg oral dose of a specific valerian extract (Sedonium, Lichtwer Pharma) in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of valerenic acid is about 1.1 hours (14405).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of valerian is the root and rhizome. The pharmacological effects of valerian have primarily been attributed to valepotriates (iridoid esters such as valtrate), baldrinals, volatile oils, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes constituents (3486, 81704, 81705, 81706, 81707, 81709, 81715). The primary monoterpene is borneol and the primary sesquiterpenes are valerenic acid, valeranone, and kessel glycol (3484, 3486, 15043). Other potentially active constituents include the flavonoids 6-methylapigenin, hesperidin, and linarin (15043, 54810, 81677). The valepotriates decompose to other potentially active compounds, notably baldrinal and homobaldrinal (3486, 81709, 81715). The characteristic unpleasant odor of valerian has been attributed to isovaleric acid.\n\nValerenic acid and valepotriate constituents have received the most attention. Some valerian extracts are standardized based on the valerenic acid constituent. These extracts can be standardized to contain from 0.25% to 1% valerenic acid.\n\nThe roots and rhizomes of valerian can have wide variation in the composition of these constituents, and different species of valerian can also have a different constituent profile.\n\nValeriana officinalis primarily contains valerenic acid and its derivatives as well as the valepotriates. Valeriana wallichii and Valeriana edulis do not contain valerenic acid (15043). Because valerian extracts without some of these constituents can still have similar effects, it is likely that multiple constituents are responsible for its pharmacological effects.\nCarcinogenic potential\nValepotriates are highly unstable and rapidly decompose in acid or alkaline environments and at high temperatures. Although there are published reports of toxicity due to the valepotriate constituents, these constituents are poorly absorbed and quickly degraded to less toxic metabolites and are not likely to cause acute adverse reactions (3486). The presence of an epoxide group on the valepotriates has raised concern about possible cytotoxicity and carcinogenicity (3485, 3486); however, in vivo studies to date have failed to show any carcinogenic effects (3486). In fact, some evidence from in vitro research has shown that various acylated iridoids and valepotriates derived from the roots of valerian weakly to moderately inhibit the growth of A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatoma), and SK-BR-3 (breast carcinoma), PC-3M (metastatic prostate cancer), HCT-8 (colon cancer), and Bel 7402 (hepatoma) cell lines (81706, 81707). Also evidence from animal research shows that valepotriates exert cytotoxic effects on hepatoma cell lines and inhibit DNA and protein synthesis; didrovaltrate prolonged survival in mice bearing ascitic tumors (81712, 81714).\nCYP450 effects\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effects of valerian on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). In vitro, valerian extract seems to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme (6450, 12214); however, clinical research suggests valerian does not significantly affect CYP3A4 when used at a relatively low dose of 375 mg/day, but modestly inhibits CYP3A4 at a higher dose of 1000 mg/day (13014, 13536). It does not seem to significantly affect cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), or (CYP2E1) cytochrome P450 2E1 (13014).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that valerian extract may reduce gastric mucosal damage, inhibit intestinal spasm, and improve intestinal peristalsis in the setting of gastrointestinal disease. Valerian is theorized to mitigate gastric damage and reduce gastric lesions induced by ethanol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects (111221).\nHypotensive effects\nIn anesthetized guinea pigs, orally administered valerian root extracts (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) demonstrated significant anticoronaryspastic and antihypertensive effects against pitressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, which were similar to those exhibited by nifedipine (19428).\nLactation effects\nThere is concern that valerian may alter the composition of breast milk. In rats receiving valerian extract at doses two- to four-fold greater than the lowest dose recommendations from reproductive toxicity trials, milk had lower protein content and greater lactose content, with unchanged cholesterol or triglyceride content, when compared with the milk of rats receiving control (106628).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nValerians anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative properties may be due to the effects of its constituents on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine A1, and serotonin (5HT) receptors. Valerenic acid and other constituents of valerian are GABA agonists. Valerian constituents may inhibit the enzyme system responsible for the central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentrations and decreasing CNS activity. Valerian may also bind directly to GABA-A receptors and stimulate the release and reuptake of GABA (3486, 12720, 56982, 81666, 81688, 81718, 81720, 81739, 81740, 81741)(81742). However, other research suggests that the presence of small quantities of GABA in valerian extracts may have confounded these results by directly elevating measured GABA levels in the synaptic cleft (81719, 81722). In addition to the effects on GABA, valerian might affect sleep regulation via activity on adenosine and serotonin (5-HT1) receptors (12720, 81679, 81682, 81683, 81687, 81692). One study in female mice shows that valerenic acid improves multiple anxiety-related behaviors, with an overall anxiolytic effect similar to that of diazepam (114802).\n\nSome evidence in animals and human subjects also suggests that valerian may have some antidepressant effects (81673, 81702, 81717). While the activity in depression is unclear, these effects may be mediated via GABA-related mechanisms and/or the binding of valerian constituents to serotonin (5HT1A) receptors (19405).\n\nAnimal research shows that female offspring of rats that received valerian extract during the postnatal period demonstrate behavior indicative of memory impairment as adults (106628). The clinical implications of this finding are unclear.\n\nEvidence from animal models suggests that valerian extract may reduce cold allodynia, a symptom commonly associated with neuropathic pain, when compared with placebo (108063).\nSleep effects\nResearch in male rats with induced neuropathic pain shows that taking valerian extract for 3 weeks increases the density and frequency of sleep spindles and may extend the time spent in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when compared with placebo. Valerian also increased the length of REM sleep, but this was subsequently reduced following the introduction of a neuropathic pain condition (108063)."

It appears to augment the effects of insulin in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes, but might not have an effect in type 1 diabetes (482).

Vetiver root also contains volatile oil which is rich in sesquiterpenes, including zizanoic acid, khusimol, and khusenic acid (5279, 112776). The specific sesquiterpene levels differ between varieties of vetiver (82027).\nAntimicrobial effects\nVetiver essential oil has bactericidal activity against Bacillus subtilis, and also against some multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilm-producing bacteria. It is not active against Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial activity may be due to the sesquiterpene constituents, khusimol and khusenic acid (112776).\nNephroprotective effects\nResearch in an animal model of drug-induced nephrotoxicity shows that an aqueous extract of vetiver root given orally for 3 days attenuates renal parenchymal injury, lowering serum creatinine, beta-2-microglobulin, and blood urea nitrogen, and reducing proteinuria in a dose-dependent manner. This is followed by increases in serum albumin and total protein levels. Antioxidant properties are thought to contribute to these effects (112775)."

The bark contains proanthocyanidins, flavalignans, hydroxycinnamic acids, scopoletin, and viopudial (12229, 46358, 46359, 110884). The squeezed berries of Viburnum opulus contain polysaccharides, including galacturonic acid, galactose, arabinose, mannose, and rhamnose (46354). Viburnum opulus fruit extracts contain various phenolic compounds, including flavanols, flavalignans, and hydroxycinnamic acids, of which chlorogenic acid is most abundant (106520).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the plant are the aerial parts, which contain various aliphatic aldehydes including (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, decanal, undecanal, and dodecanal, as well as the aldehyde 3-sulfanyl-hexanal (26211, 26212); various aliphatic alcohols and the alcohol 3-sulfanyl-hexan-1-ol (26211, 26212); esters including methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, and methyl hexadecanoate (26212); acids including decanoic acid, (Z)-2-hexenoic acid, dodecanoic acid, and octanoic acid (26212); terpenoids including beta-bisabolene, gamma-elemene, carbitol, geraniol, and (E)-nerolidol (26212); flavonoids including quercetin, kaempherol, rutin, catechin, and isorhamnetin (26214, 26215); and other constituents including caryophyllene oxide, 4-decanolide, chavicol, 8-methyl-dihydrobenzopyrone, 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol, and E-15-heptadecenal (26212, 26213, 104523).\nAntineoplastic effect\nVietnamese coriander root contains 8-methyl-dihydrobenzopyrone. In vitro evidence suggests that 8-methyl-dihydrobenzopyrone inactivates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 by inducing phosphorylation, which induces in mitotic arrest in breast cancer cells (26213). Other in vitro evidence shows that extract of Vietnamese coriander leaf inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells while remaining nontoxic to normal cells (26215).\nAntioxidant effect\nVietnamese coriander contains the flavonoids quercetin, kaempherol, rutin, catechin, and isorhamnetin and 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol and E-15-heptadecenal (26214, 26215, 104523). In vitro evidence suggests that extract of Vietnamese coriander leaf and/or stem has antioxidant activity according to results from the DPPH radical scavenging assay (26215, 26216, 104523) and FRAP assay (26216). Some leaf extracts have demonstrated higher concentrations of these antioxidant constituents when compared with stem extracts of Vietnamese coriander (104523).\nBone effects\nA small clinical study in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women shows that taking a mixture of Vietnamese coriander and white mulberry extracts for 8 weeks increases plasma levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, which are markers of bone formation. This combination also decreases C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), a marker of bone resorption (100626). It is not clear if these changes produce clinically significant improvements in bone density. Additionally, it is not clear if these effects are due to white mulberry or Vietnamese coriander.\nGastroprotective effects\nIn animals, ingesting an aqueous extract of Vietnamese coriander one hour prior to oral ethanol administration protects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury and increases mucus production, suggesting that Vietnamese coriander may protect against gastric ulcers (27238)."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledged new dietary ingredient notifications for vinpocetine in the 1990s. However, in September 2016, the FDA issued a tentative conclusion that vinpocetine may not meet requirements to be considered a dietary supplement. They requested comments about this conclusion from stakeholders (92936).

Oral vinpocetine, taken for up to 1 year, might improve cognitive function to a small degree in patients with dementia.\nWhile some conflicting evidence exists (1784), several small clinical studies in patients with cognitive impairment due to various causes including dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular disease show that taking vinpocetine 5-20 mg three times daily for up to 1 year slightly to modestly improves cognitive function when compared with baseline scores or placebo (1787, 1789, 82151, 82152, 82153, 82154, 82179, 82180)(82182, 82183, 92934, 111333).

Although there has been interest in using oral and intravenous vinpocetine for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vinpocetine for this purpose.\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vinpocetine is beneficial in patients with hearing loss.\nOne small clinical study in patients with acoustic trauma shows that intravenous administration of vinpocetine 10 mg twice daily for 10 days is less effective than nicergoline, an ergot derivative, for improving hearing loss (82147). Another small, open-label clinical study in patients with sensorineural hearing loss shows that taking vinpocetine 10 mg three times daily for 12 months improves some measures of hearing capacity, particularly in months 6-12, when compared to baseline (106845). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nMemory. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vinpocetine might slightly improve memory in healthy individuals.\nTwo very small clinical studies in healthy individuals show that taking vinpocetine 40 mg as a single dose or vinpocetine 10-40 mg three times daily for 2 days enhances some measures of memory when compared with placebo (1796, 1797). Additionally, one small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination product containing vinpocetine 10 mg, ginkgo extract 40 mg, and other ingredients three times daily for 2 weeks improves short-term memory when compared with placebo (8544).

Although there has been interest in using oral vinpocetine for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vinpocetine for this purpose.\nStroke. Research on the use of intravenous vinpocetine to improve outcomes in patients recovering from ischemic stroke is mixed. It is unclear if oral vinpocetine is beneficial in these patients.\nSome small clinical studies show that vinpocetine modestly reduces the residual effects of acute ischemic stroke (1785, 10222, 82087, 82091, 82120, 82158, 82159, 82186). However, most clinical studies investigating the use of vinpocetine for stroke have been published in languages other than English and assessed intravenous formulations of vinpocetine not available in the US. One large clinical study shows that intravenous administration of vinpocetine 30 mg once daily for 7 days after an acute stroke, in addition to oral citicoline and aspirin or clopidogrel, seems to improve cerebral blood flow and measures of cognition, neurological function, and quality of life when compared with citicoline plus aspirin or clopidogrel (98226). A meta-analysis of 4 moderate-to-good quality clinical studies that included 837 adults with acute ischemic stroke, some of which are described above, shows that intravenous administration of vinpocetine in addition to standard care, followed by oral administration in some studies, reduces significant disability when compared with standard care. Vinpocetine also seems to improve cognition scores but does not reduce mortality (110744). The included studies used widely heterogeneous dosing regimens and excluded patients with severe strokes. However, a small clinical study not included in the meta-analysis shows that intravenous vinpocetine 20 mg followed by oral vinpocetine 10 mg three times daily for 3 months does not significantly improve neurophysical functioning post-stroke when compared with placebo (82074).\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vinpocetine is beneficial in patients with tinnitus.\nA small observational study in patients with chronic unilateral or bilateral tinnitus has found that intravenous infusion of a specific vinpocetine product (Cavinton) 20 mg plus oral vinpocetine (Cavinton) 10 mg twice daily along with physiotherapy is associated with improved symptoms when compared to baseline (82099). However, a small clinical study in patients with tinnitus due to acoustic trauma shows that intravenous administration of vinpocetine (Cavinton) 10 mg twice daily appears to be less effective than nicergoline, an ergot derivative, for reducing tinnitus (82147).\nless\nUrinary incontinence. It is unclear if oral vinpocetine is beneficial in patients with urinary incontinence.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with urinary incontinence shows that taking vinpocetine 10 mg three times daily for 2 weeks reduces daytime and nighttime frequency of urination when compared to baseline (82041).

In older adults, oral administration of vinpocetine 20 mg results in a longer time to maximum concentration of 2.3 hours, with an absolute bioavailability of 6.7% (82109).\n\nVinpocetine has been applied topically; the transdermal barrier of vinpocetine is mainly in the stratum corneum (82177). In excised hairless rat and human skin, simultaneous use of l-menthol and ethanol increased the skin permeation of vinpocetine (82135).\nDistribution\nVinpocetine is highly fat soluble and highly plasma protein bound (82048). Vinpocetine rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the cerebrospinal fluid (82081). After oral and intravenous administration, vinpocetine has been heterogeneously distributed in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes (82070, 82031, 82054). In healthy patients, oral vinpocetine appeared in the liver and the blood within minutes of administration (82052, 82062).\nMetabolism\nVinpocetine appears to be metabolized exclusively by the liver (82048). In animal research, oral or intravenous vinpocetine undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism into mostly apovincaminic acid. Two minor metabolites are also produced: hydroxy-vinpocetine and dihydroxy-apovincaminic acid-glycine amide (82115).\nExcretion\nIn healthy males who took vinpocetine for seven days, both vinpocetine and apovincaminic acid exhibited linear pharmacokinetics; there was no accumulation or autoinduction (82107). After oral administration, the half-life of vinpocetine is 1.7-2.9 hours; the half-life of apovincaminic acid, the primary metabolite of vinpocetine, is 1.25 hours. After intravenous administration, the half-life of vinpocetine is 2-17 hours and the half-life of apovincaminic acid is 2.8-3.7 hours (82081, 82125, 92937).\n\nVinpocetine is partially renally eliminated after ester cleavage (68754, 82052, 82062). Vinpocetine is primarily excreted as apovincaminic acid in the feces and in the urine (82173, 82115). The rate of elimination of vinpocetine after intravenous administration is 0.366 L/hour/kg (82122).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVinpocetine is a synthetic derivative of apovincamine, a compound found in the periwinkle plant, Vinca minor. It is also called ethyl apovincaminate or 14-ethoxycarbonyl-(3alpha,16alpha-ethyl)-14,15-eburnamine (68731).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory effects. In islet cells of aged rats and in a rodent model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, vinpocetine significantly reduced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), although the exact mechanism of this effect is unclear (106844, 112879). In a mouse model of atopic dermatitis, treatment with vinpocetine 2 mg/kg topically, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, or 20 mg/kg orally reduces serum immunoglobulin levels (i.e. IgE, IgG) and the concentration of IL-4, IL-13, and eosinophils in the skin when compared with no treatment (110745). Similarly, in a rodent model of psoriasiform dermatitis, topical vinpocetine improved psoriatic lesions and reduced levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, nuclear factor kappa B, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-23, and IL-37 in the skin (112881).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that vinpocetine has antioxidant effects. In islet cells of aged rats, vinpocetine significantly reduced markers of oxidative stress, although the exact mechanism of this effect is unclear (106844). Research in an animal model found vinpocetine to increase glutathione and superoxide dismutase and decrease malondialdehyde and catalase (112879).\nCardiovascular effects\nVinpocetine appears to have a therapeutic effect in ischemia and in atherosclerosis, possibly by reducing inflammatory reactions. It appears to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from endothelial cells, macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, and microglia (92935, 112879). In a rodent model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, administration of vinpocetine improved ejection fraction, cardiac output, and left ventricular diastolic blood pressure, and reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, collagen deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration in cardiac tissue. Vinpocetine also reduced levels of cardiac injury markers such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-myocardial band, reduced mRNA and protein expression of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and attenuated changes to levels of antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and catalase (112879).\nChelating effects\nSome animal research suggests that vinpocetine may have mineral-chelating activity. This has been documented in a small number of patients receiving hemodialysis who developed tumoral calcinosis, or calcium deposition of the soft tissue in and around the joints. One case series of 8 patients with tumoral calcinosis suggests that taking vinpocetine 15 mg daily for up to one year eliminates these calcium deposits when compared to baseline (1788).\nDermatologic effects\nIn a rodent model of psoriasiform dermatitis, topical application of vinpocetine improved psoriatic lesions and reduced levels of inflammatory markers in the skin such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), nuclear factor kappa B and interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-17A, IL-23, and IL-37 (112881).\nHematologic effects\nVinpocetine inhibits drug-induced platelet aggregation (1801, 82148). Clinical research shows that vinpocetine 1 mg/kg intravenously or 30 mg by mouth for three months decreases red blood cell aggregation, as well as plasma and whole blood viscosity in people with chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease (82101, 82119). In a similar patient population, vinpocetine 70 mg intravenously daily for seven days significantly decreased hematocrit, red blood cell aggregation, and whole blood and plasma viscosity (82058). Additionally, clinical research suggests that vinpocetine enhances red blood cell deformability which decreases the chance of cell rupture and improves the ability of the red blood cell to transport oxygen (1790, 1791, 82064, 82117).\nMemory enhancement effects\nVinpocetine has been used for improving memory. The mechanism may involve increased blood circulation and metabolism in the brain, decreased neuronal death, production of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, and improved intracerebral glucose utilization (1786, 82061, 82133, 82172, 112882).\nNeurologic effects\nVinpocetine has been used for its cognitive benefits. Some studies indicate that vinpocetine might enhance cerebral vasodilatation and blood flow without affecting peripheral blood flow (1786, 1793, 10061, 12300, 82138, 82164, 82165, 98226). Preliminary evidence indicates that vinpocetine stimulates cerebral metabolism and increases glucose and oxygen uptake and consumption by the brain (10827, 82129, 82053, 82108, 82149, 98226).\n\nPotential mechanisms for the nootropic-like effects of vinpocetine include indirect or direct cholinergic activity, augmented norepinephrine effects on cortical cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and increased turnover of brain catecholamines (1800). Vinpocetine selectively inhibits calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) in laboratory studies which in turn increases intracellular cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which may improve neuroplasticity (82034, 82043, 82068, 82075, 82085, 82088, 82097, 82138, 82142)(82144, 82145, 112882). In an animal model of Alzheimer disease, vinpocetine administration improved the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (112882). It might also improve microcirculation in the brain and increase cerebral blood flow by improving red blood cell deformability, reducing cerebral vascular resistance, and inhibiting platelet aggregation (10827, 82042, 82053, 82070, 82096).\n\nPharmacological effects of vinpocetine that might be useful in treating stroke include a possible neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effect by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (82037, 82059, 82130, 82131, 82138, 82143). It also might protect neurons by enhancing the effect of adenosine in preventing hypoxia. Animal studies suggest that vinpocetine decreases neuronal apoptosis and death in ischemia and decreases the size of cerebral infarction and microglia proliferation in experimental strokes (10728, 82100, 82105, 82106, 82150, 112880). Another theory is that vinpocetine can decrease ischemic damage by decreasing oxidation (82033, 82046, 82140). A mouse model of traumatic brain injury also suggests vinpocetine may have neuroprotective effects. This study shows that treatment with vinpocetine 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg orally for 4 weeks improves cognitive and motor function and levels of acetylcholinesterase, antioxidants, catecholamines, and markers of oxidative stress when compared with placebo (110746).\n\nTreatment with vinpocetine may improve radiation-induced cognitive impairment via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. One small, low-quality clinical study in these patients shows that vinpocetine may modestly improve cognitive function while decreasing inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-8, interleukin-20, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Some have suggested this occurs via direct interactions with toll-like receptors. Clinical research also shows that vinpocetine increases antioxidants such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase (104522).\nOphthalmic effects\nVinpocetine has been used for eye disease such as age-related macular degeneration. Vinpocetine may have positive effects on eye disease because it improves blood flow of the retinal precapillary, capillary, and choroid capillary networks (82029, 82084).\nOtic effects\nVinpocetine has been studied for hearing loss and tinnitus. Theoretically, vinpocetine prevents hearing loss in animals by blocking sodium channels and preventing aminoglycoside-induced damage to the auditory brainstem response (82035). Animal research shows that vinpocetine prevents the retrocochlear alterations and hearing decline that can occur with epileptic cortical activity (82067, 82130, 82131).\nUrinary effects\nVinpocetine has been proposed for the symptomatic treatment of urinary incontinence and detrusor instability (82039, 82041). Vinpocetine appears to relax and desensitize the bladder (82069). Laboratory research shows that vinpocetine inhibits contractions of detrusor smooth muscle strips from the urinary bladder (82137, 82146)."

    "Vitamin A": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. Different vitamin A forms include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl ester. These different forms of preformed vitamin A are often collectively referred to as dietary \"retinoids.\" The most potent form of vitamin A, all-trans retinol, is the form of retinol in the diet (9191). Retinol is present in esterified form in animal-derived products including liver, eggs, whole milk, butter, fortified margarine, meat, and oily saltwater fish (7135).\n\nThe vitamin A family also includes provitamin A carotenoids, which are dietary precursors to retinol. About a third of dietary vitamin A comes from carotenoids found in plants, particularly deeply colored orange, red, and green fruits and vegetables (7135). The amount of carotenoids absorbed and converted to vitamin A in the body depends upon the amount of carotenoids ingested, the individual's vitamin A status, and carotenoid body stores (8044). This monograph covers only preformed vitamin A.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally or intramuscularly and appropriately. Vitamin A, as pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester), is safe in adults when taken in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10,000 IU (3000 mcg) daily (7135). Higher doses increase the risk of side effects. In an analysis of studies, taking vitamin A supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants is associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes (15305, 90775). Vitamin A is available in two different forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). The safety concerns associated with high vitamin A intake refer to pre-formed vitamin A only. Some supplements contain vitamin A in both pre-formed and provitamin A forms. For these supplements, the amount of pre-formed vitamin A should be used as the reference amount to determine safety.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used topically and appropriately, short-term. Retinol up to 0.5% has been used on the skin daily for up to 12 weeks with apparent safety. No serious adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials (103671, 103680, 114500).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Doses higher than the UL of 10,000 IU (3000 mcg) per day of pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) might increase the risk of side effects (7135). While vitamin A 25,000 IU (as retinyl palmitate) daily for 6 months followed by 10,000 IU daily for 6 months has been used with apparent safety in one clinical trial (95052), prolonged use of excessive doses of vitamin A can cause hypervitaminosis A (7135). The risk for developing hypervitaminosis A is related to total cumulative dose of vitamin A rather than a specific daily dose (1467, 1469). In an analysis of studies, taking vitamin A supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants is associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes (15305, 90775).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using sublingual formulations of vitamin A.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally or intramuscularly and appropriately. The amount of pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) that is safe depends on age. For children up to 3 years of age, doses less than 2000 IU (600 mcg) per day seem to be safe. For children ages 4 to 8, doses less than 3000 IU (900 mcg) per day seem to be safe. For children ages 9 to 13, doses less than 5667 IU (1700 mcg) per day seem to be safe. For children 14 to 18, doses less than 9333 IU (2800 mcg) per day seem to be safe (7135). Vitamin A is available in two different forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). The safety concerns associated with high vitamin A intake occur with pre-formed vitamin A only. Some supplements contain vitamin A in both pre-formed and provitamin A forms. For these supplements, the amount of pre-formed vitamin A should be used as the reference amount for determining safety.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) is used orally in excessive doses. For children up to 3 years of age, avoid doses greater than 2000 IU (600 mcg) per day. For children ages 4 to 8, avoid doses greater than 3000 IU (900 mcg) per day. For children ages 9 to 13, avoid doses greater than 5667 IU (1700 mcg) per day. For children ages 14 to 18, avoid doses greater than 9333 IU (2800 mcg) per day (7135). Higher doses of vitamin A supplementation have been associated with increased risk of side effects such as pneumonia, bone pain, and diarrhea (319, 95051). Long-term supplementation with low to moderate doses on a regular basis can cause severe, but usually reversible, liver damage (11978).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally or intramuscularly and appropriately. Vitamin A, as pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester), is safe during pregnancy and lactation when used in doses less than 10,000 IU (3000 mcg) per day in adults 19 years of age and older and 2800 mcg daily in those 14-18 years of age (7135, 16823, 107293). Vitamin A is available in two different forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). The safety concerns associated with high vitamin A intake occur with pre-formed vitamin A only. Some supplements contain vitamin A in both pre-formed and provitamin A forms. For these supplements, the amount of pre-formed vitamin A should be used as the reference amount to determine safety.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally or intramuscularly in excessive doses. Daily intake of greater than 10,000 IU (3000 mcg) can cause fetal malformations (3066, 7135). Excessive dietary intake of vitamin A has also been associated with teratogenicity (11978). The first trimester of pregnancy seems to be the critical period for susceptibility to vitamin A-associated birth defects such as craniofacial abnormalities and abnormalities of the central nervous system (7135). Pregnant patients should monitor their intake of pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester). This form of vitamin A is found in several foods including animal products, particularly fish and animal liver, some fortified breakfast cereals, and dietary supplements (3066).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, vitamin A is generally well-tolerated at doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL).\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: In very high doses, vitamin A can cause pseudotumor cerebri, pain, liver toxicity, coma, and even death.\nDermatologic\nChronic oral use of large amounts of vitamin A causes symptoms of vitamin A toxicity including dry skin and lips; cracking, scaling, and itchy skin; skin redness and rash; hyperpigmentation; shiny skin, and massive skin peeling (7135, 95051). Hypervitaminosis A can cause brittle nails, cheilitis, gingivitis, and hair loss (15, 95051). Adverse effects from a single ingestion of a large dose of vitamin A is more common in young children than adults (15). In children, approximately 25,000 IU/kg can cause skin redness and generalized peeling of the skin a few days later and may last for several weeks (15).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nThere is some evidence that oral vitamin A supplementation might increase the risk of diarrhea in children. Although vitamin A can prevent diarrhea and reduce mortality in malnourished children, doses as low as 10,000 IU weekly for 40 weeks have been associated with diarrhea in well-nourished children (319). Diarrhea (82326, 82389), nausea (7135, 100329), abdominal pain (95051), abdominal fullness (100329), and vomiting (7135, 82559, 95051, 109755) have been reported following use of large doses of oral vitamin A. Adverse effects from a single ingestion of a large dose of vitamin A is more common in young children than adults (15). In children, approximately 25,000 IU/kg can cause vomiting and diarrhea (15). Chronic use of large amounts of vitamin A causes symptoms of vitamin A toxicity including anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and nausea and vomiting (7135).\nless\nGenitourinary\nHypervitaminosis A can cause reduced menstrual flow (15). Intravaginally, all-trans retinoic acid can cause vaginal discharge, itching, irritation, and burning (9199).\nless\nHematologic\nHypervitaminosis A can cause spider angiomas, anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia (15, 95051).\nless\nHepatic\nSince the liver is the main storage site for vitamin A, hypervitaminosis A can cause hepatotoxicity, with elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT, formerly SGPT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, formerly SGOT), as well as fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatomegaly, portal hypertension, and death (6377, 7135, 95051).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nVitamin A can increase the risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Observational research has found that chronic, high intake of vitamin A 10,000 IU or more per day is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in postmenopausal adults, as well as overall risk of fracture in middle-aged males (7712, 7713, 9190). A meta-analysis of these and other large observational studies shows that high dietary intake of vitamin A or retinol is associated with a 23% to 29% greater risk of hip fracture when compared with low dietary intake (107294). High serum levels of vitamin A as retinol also increase the risk of fracture in males. Males with high serum retinol levels are seven times more likely to fracture a hip than those with lower serum retinol levels (9190). Vitamin A damage to bone can occur subclinically, without signs or symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. Some researchers are concerned that consumption of vitamin A fortified foods such as margarine and low-fat dairy products in addition to vitamin A or multivitamin supplements might cause excessive serum retinol levels. Older people have higher levels of vitamin A and might be at increased risk for vitamin A-induced osteoporosis.\n\nVitamin A's effects on bone resorption could lead to hypercalcemia (95051).\n\nHypervitaminosis can cause slow growth, premature epiphyseal closure, painful hyperostosis of the long bones, general joint pain, osteosclerosis, muscle pain, and calcium loss from the bones (15, 95051). One child experienced severe bone pain after taking vitamin A 600,000 IU daily for more than 3 months (95051). Vitamin A was discontinued and symptoms lessened over a period of 2 weeks. The patient made a full recovery 2 months later.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, adverse effects from a single large dose of vitamin A are more common in young children than adults (15). Headache, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, vertigo, and blurred vision have been reported following an acute oral dose of vitamin A 500,000 IU (7135). In children, approximately 25,000 IU/kg can cause headache, irritability, drowsiness, dizziness, delirium, and coma (15). Chronic use of large amounts of vitamin A causes symptoms of vitamin A toxicity including fatigue, malaise, lethargy, and irritability (7135).\n\nThere are reports of bulging of the anterior fontanelle associated with an acute high oral dose of vitamin A in infants (7135, 90784, 95053, 95054). In children, approximately 25,000 IU/kg can cause increased intracranial pressure with bulging fontanelles in infants (15). Also, muscular incoordination has been reported following short-term high doses of vitamin A (7135).\n\nA case of intracranial hypertension involving diffuse headaches and brief loss of vision has been reported secondary to topical use of vitamin A. The patient was using over-the-counter vitamin A preparations twice daily including Avotin 0.05% cream, Retin-A gel 0.01%, and Isotrexin gel containing isotretinoin 0.05% and erythromycin 2%, for treatment of facial acne. Upon exam, the patient was noted to have bilateral optic disc edema. The patient discontinued use of topical vitamin A products. Two months later, the patient reported decreased headaches and an improvement in bilateral optic disc edema was seen (95056).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn children, oral vitamin A approximately 25,000 IU/kg can cause swelling of the optic disk, bulging eyeballs, and visual disturbances (15). Adverse effects from a single ingestion of a large dose of vitamin A are more common in young children than adults (15).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is concern that high intake of vitamin A might increase some forms of cancer. Population research suggests high vitamin A intake might increase the risk of gastric carcinoma (9194).\nless\nPsychiatric\nChronic oral use of large amounts of vitamin A causes symptoms of vitamin A toxicity, which can include symptoms that mimic severe depression or schizophrenic disorder (7135).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nThere is some evidence that oral vitamin A supplementation might increase the risk of pneumonia and diarrhea in children. Although vitamin A can prevent diarrhea and reduce mortality in malnourished children, doses as low as 10,000 IU weekly for 40 weeks have been associated with pneumonia and diarrhea in well-nourished children (319). In preschool children, high-dose vitamin A also increases the risk of respiratory infection (82288).\nless\nOther\nChronic use of large amounts of vitamin A (>25,000 IU daily for more than 6 years or 100,000 IU daily for more than 6 months) can cause symptoms of vitamin A toxicity including mild fever and excessive sweating (7135). High intakes of vitamin A may result in a failure to gain weight normally in children and weight loss in adults (15).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nVitamin A deficiency. Oral vitamin A is effective for treatment and prevention of vitamin A deficiency.\nClinical and observational research in children shows that taking vitamin A orally is effective for preventing and improving symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, including xerophthalmia, night blindness, and Bitot's spots (82329, 82689, 82710, 90773). Vitamin A deficiency can occur due to abnormal storage and transport of vitamin A in people with abetalipoproteinemia, protein deficiency, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, fever, liver disease, and cystic fibrosis (7135).\n\nHowever, research suggests that supplementation with vitamin A may not be necessary for most newborns with vitamin A deficiency. An observational study in newborns with vitamin A levels of 0.43-0.59 mcmol/L or >0.59 mcmol/L found that vitamin A levels increased naturally over the first six months of life, regardless of oral vitamin A supplementation. However, in infants with very low vitamin A levels (<0.43 mcmol/L), vitamin A supplementation was associated with significant increases in vitamin A levels at 6 months of age when compared with no supplementation, suggesting that only newborns with very low vitamin A levels should receive oral vitamin A (107298).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAging skin. Topical vitamin A (retinol) formulations seem to improve symptoms of aging skin, such as wrinkles and mottled pigmentation.\nThe vitamin A analog tretinoin (Renova) is a prescription drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive use in reducing fine wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of aging facial skin (103711). However, this drug is not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, which have not been as extensively evaluated in clinical research.\n\nAlthough research evaluating non-prescription topical vitamin A shows benefit for reducing wrinkles, most studies have been small and used different formulations. One small study in adults over 40 years of age shows that applying a pea size amount of 0.075% retinol cream to the face daily for 26 weeks seems to reduce deep and fine wrinkling when compared with placebo. Applying a lower dose of 0.04% retinol cream for 13 weeks seems to reduce fine wrinkling to a lesser degree, with no effect on deep wrinkles, when compared with placebo cream (104458). Another small clinical study in adults over 80 years of age shows that applying 2 mL of retinol 0.4% lotion to the upper arm up to 3 times weekly for 24 weeks reduces visible wrinkles when compared with placebo (94683). Two small studies in females ages 33 to 65 show that applying retinol 0.15%, 0.3% and 0.5% in liquid crystal formulation once daily to the face for 2-3 months improves skin pigmentation, elasticity, and wrinkles when compared with baseline (103680, 104464). The validity of these two studies is limited by the lack of a comparator treatment.\n\nTopical vitamin A is frequently combined with other ingredients in commercial formulations; however these combinations have rarely been studied. A small clinical study in adults over 35 years with skin aging shows that applying a cream containing retinol 0.5%, niacinamide, resveratrol, and hexylresorcinol seems to improve wrinkling and skin tone when compared with baseline (104455). Another small preliminary clinical trial in adults ages 35-65 years with periorbital lines and wrinkles shows that applying a cream containing retinol modestly improves dryness, puffiness, redness, and darkness when compared with baseline. The retinol was conjugated with lactic acid, and the cream contained other nutrient and herbal ingredients It was applied around the eyes each evening, sometimes used in combination with another product each morning (109747).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Intramuscular vitamin A may reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very low birth weight infants when given at a dose of 5000 IU three times weekly for 28 days. Lower doses do not seem to be effective. It is unclear if enteral vitamin A is beneficial for BPD.\nA meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in premature infants shows that intramuscular administration of vitamin A every other day or three times weekly for 28 days reduces the risk of BPD by around 33% when compared with control (107297). The results from this meta-analysis are primarily driven by a modestly sized clinical trial in very low birth weight infants which shows that intramuscular administration of vitamin A 5000 IU three times weekly for 28 days reduces the risk of BPD by 15% when compared with a sham control (82195). A subgroup analysis of this trial suggests that infants with the lowest BPD risk estimate based on gestational age, birth weight, sex, ethnicity, and oxygen levels 24 hours after birth appear to benefit more from vitamin A therapy than those with higher BPD risk estimates (107296).\n\nPrevious research in this area utilized a lower dose of only 2000 IU every other day for 28 days, and showed no significant improvement in the rate of BPD (82331, 82613). The evaluation of a higher dose was prompted by research noting that the lower doses evaluated in these earlier studies were unable to achieve serum retinol concentrations above 25 mcg/dL, while doses at or above 5000 IU three times weekly could reach this level (82731).\n\nEnteral vitamin A has also been investigated. Meta-analyses of two clinical trials show that supplementation with vitamin A at an average of 5,000 IU daily, staring within four days of birth, does not reduce the incidence of BPD when compared with placebo (109750, 109753).\nless\nDiarrhea. Vitamin A seems to reduce the incidence of diarrhea in young children. However, it is unclear if oral vitamin A while breastfeeding is beneficial for preventing diarrhea in nursing infants.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children up to age 5 shows that vitamin A supplementation reduces the incidence of diarrhea by 15% and mortality related to diarrhea by 12% when compared with control, usually placebo or no supplementation (109755). However, one small clinical trial in breastfeeding parents shows that supplementation of vitamin A 1800 IU and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 600 IU daily for 2 months does not reduce the risk of diarrhea in the nursing infants when compared with placebo (107293).\nless\nMeasles. High-dose vitamin A, at recommended age-specific doses, seems to reduce mortality in children with measles under 2 years of age. Additionally, vitamin A may reduce the incidence of measles in children up to 5 years of age who are at risk for vitamin A deficiency.\nVitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for severe measles, as well as measles-related morbidity and mortality. The use of vitamin A supplementation for the treatment of measles has been studied mostly in resource-limited countries with increased risk for vitamin A deficiency. However, measles infection has also been shown to deplete vitamin A stores, leading to recommendations for vitamin A supplementation in acute measles, regardless of geographic location (115976).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin A does not reduce mortality in children with measles when all ages and/or doses are considered (82373, 82502). However, a sub-analysis of 3 studies that utilized a higher dose of 200,000 IU orally daily for two days, in children under 2 years of age who were hospitalized with measles, shows that this dosing regimen reduces the relative risk of mortality by about 60% when compared with placebo (82373, 82502). Additionally, vitamin A supplementation in children with measles may reduce the risk of some complications, such as croup (82373). Most studies in these analyses were conducted in regions with high measles case-fatality rates; the benefit of vitamin A supplementation in regions with lower case-fatality rates, such as the United States, is unclear.\n\nBased on these data, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treatment with vitamin A, using age-specific doses, for all children with acute measles (115966). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recommends the administration of age-specific doses to all children with measles, regardless of severity, as follows: 200,000 IU daily for 2 days in children at least one year of age, 100,000 IU daily for 2 days in children 6-12 months of age, and 50,000 IU daily for 2 days in children under 6 months old. In children with clinical symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, an additional age-specific dose is recommended 2-6 weeks later (115977).\n\nVitamin A supplementation has also been studied in apparently healthy children living in regions at high risk for vitamin A deficiency. A meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies shows that taking vitamin A reduces the incidence of measles in children ages 6 months to 5 years. These studies provided vitamin A supplementation either as a single high dose or as three high doses over one year. In 3 studies, vitamin A was given in conjunction with measles vaccination; vaccination status was not provided for the other studies (109755). The WHO and AAP do not recommend the use of vitamin A for measles prevention. Instead, routine measles vaccination is recommended. Additionally, for people over 6 months of age with recent measles exposure who are unimmunized or insufficiently immunized, immediate measles vaccination is recommended (115966, 115977).\nless\nNight vision. Oral vitamin A as retinyl palmitate seems to reduce night blindness during pregnancy in malnourished patients.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) 23,000 IU weekly before and during pregnancy reduces pregnancy-related night blindness by 37% in malnourished patients (6154). Some evidence suggests that zinc supplements might potentiate the effects of vitamin A in restoring sight in zinc-deficient pregnant patients affected by night blindness (8630).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. High-dose oral vitamin A seems to reduce oral leukoplakia lesions in patients that chew tobacco and/or betel nut.\nClinical research in patients with tobacco and/or betel nut chewing habits shows that taking oral vitamin A 200,000-300,000 IU weekly for 6-12 months seems to result in remission of leukoplakia lesions in over 50% of participants when compared with placebo (34674, 82617). However, it is unknown if vitamin A prevents the development of oral cancer from oral leukoplakia lesions.\nless\nOverall mortality. In children at risk for vitamin A deficiency, oral vitamin A seems to reduce mortality. However, it does not seem to reduce mortality in healthy adults.\nDespite previous debate on whether the programs supplying high-dose vitamin A in low- and middle-income countries with prevalent vitamin A deficiency are safe and effective for reducing child mortality, most experts, including World Health Organization, recommend high-dose vitamin A supplementation for those children (95055, 95724, 97170, 109755). Meta-analyses including 8-18 clinical studies show that vitamin A supplementation reduces all-cause mortality by about 12%-26% in children 6 months to 5 years of age (82559, 95055, 115748), but does not seem to reduce mortality in neonates or children 1-6 months of age (115748). Notably, the largest clinical trial conducted to date (Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A; DEVTA), which involved one million preschool children and was included in one of the previously discussed meta-analyses, suggests that high-dose vitamin A supplementation does not reduce mortality (90773). However, this trial was limited due to under-resourcing and undetermined patient consent and treatment compliance (90773).\n\nAdult mortality is not reduced by vitamin A supplementation. In fact, some evidence even shows that vitamin A supplementation increases mortality when administered to healthy adult patients or those with a stabilized disease (15305, 34622, 90775).\nless\nPostpartum complications. Oral vitamin A seems to reduce postpartum diarrhea and mortality in malnourished patients.\nA large clinical study in malnourished pregnant patients in Nepal shows that taking vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) 23,000 IU weekly before, during, and after pregnancy reduces the occurrence of blood and mucus in the stool by 93% and the occurrence of diarrhea by up to 90% during the first 6 months postpartum when compared with placebo (2581). Another clinical study in the same population shows that taking vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) 23,000 IU weekly before and during pregnancy reduces pregnancy-related mortality by 40% when compared with placebo (6153).\nless\nRetinitis pigmentosa. Oral vitamin A supplementation in children with retinitis pigmentosa seems to slow retinal function decline.\nObservational and clinical research in children with retinitis pigmentosa shows that taking an age-adjusted dose of vitamin A, up to a maximum dose of 15,000 IU daily, modestly attenuates the decline in retinal function when compared with control (83, 97167, 103677).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral vitamin A supplementation in patients with ulcerative colitis seems to improve clinical response and mucosal healing.\nA clinical study in adults with symptomatic ulcerative colitis despite treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid shows that taking vitamin A 25,000 IU daily for 2 months reduces disease severity and increases the rate of clinical response and mucosal healing when compared with placebo. The number needed to treat (NNT) for clinical response is 3; the NNT for mucosal healing is 5 (100329).\nless\nWrinkled skin. Topical vitamin A (retinol) formulations seem to improve photodamage and wrinkles.\nThe vitamin A analog tretinoin (Renova) is a prescription drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive use in reducing fine wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin (103711). This drug is not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, which have not been as extensively evaluated in clinical research.\n\nSome research in females ages 35-65 with moderately wrinkled and photoaged skin suggests that commercially available retinol formulations might reduce wrinkles and skin roughness similarly to tretinoin. One study used retinol serum starting at a concentration of 0.25% and increased to 1% over 3 months, compared with tretinoin cream 0.025% gradually increased to 0.1% (103671), while another study compared a gradual release tri-retinol 1.1% cream applied daily for 3 months to tretinoin 0.025% cream (104456). Commercial retinol also seems to be beneficial when compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies including a total of 352 females over 30 years of age with mild to moderate photodamage shows that applying stabilized retinol 0.1% to the face once or twice daily for 8-12 weeks reduces overall photodamage when compared with placebo. Retinol also reduced uneven skin tone, brown spots, wrinkles and fine lines on the forehead, cheek, and undereye, and crow's feet. Five of the six studies used a split-face design, with each participant serving as their own control. Skin assessments were performed by a single dermatologist in all six studies (114500).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAtopic disease. Supplementation with oral vitamin A does not seem to reduce the risk of atopy.\nClinical research in infants born in Guinea-Bissau shows that a single dose of vitamin A does not reduce the incidence of atopy when compared with placebo (90779, 90780). Furthermore, giving a single dose of vitamin A to some infants, such as low birth weight infants and infants given Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, was associated with increased atopy and wheeze (90779).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Giving oral vitamin A to malnourished adults during pregnancy and postpartum does not seem to reduce fetal, early infant, or first year mortality. Giving oral or intramuscular vitamin A to the infant also does not seem to reduce mortality in most patients.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research in malnourished patients suggest that vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy or postpartum does not reduce fetal, early infant, or first year mortality (6152, 34601, 34602, 34627, 82479, 82566, 82567, 90774, 90776, 90782, 90784, 95057, 109750, 109753). Also, giving vitamin A supplements or intramuscular vitamin A to low birth weight infants does not appear to reduce mortality in these patients (82195, 82431, 82498, 90778, 90781, 95053, 107296, 107297). Furthermore, vitamin A supplementation in term infants from low or middle income countries also does not appear to reduce the risk of mortality at 6 or 12 months of age when compared with placebo (95054, 103674). Some evidence from a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin A supplementation may reduce the risk of mortality at 6 months in Asian infants, although it appears to increase the risk of mortality at 6 months in studies conducted in Africa. It also appears to increase the risk of mortality in female term infants by 12 months (95054).\nless\nIntestinal parasite infection. Oral high-dose vitamin A does not seem to prevent reinfection with intestinal parasites.\nClinical research in children living in Malaysia that were given albendazole 400 mg daily for 3-4 days for parasitic worms, shows that adding a single dose of vitamin A 200,000 IU does not help to prevent reinfection when compared with placebo (90772).\nless\nMelanoma. Oral vitamin A in patients with resected melanoma does not seem to improve survival and disease recurrence.\nA clinical study in patients with completely resected melanoma shows that taking vitamin A 100,000 IU daily for 18 months does not increase disease-free survival when compared with no supplementation (82670).\nless\nMiscarriage. Oral vitamin A given to the mother does not prevent miscarriage or stillbirth.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that maternal supplementation with oral vitamin A, either alone or in combination with other vitamins, prior to or during early pregnancy does not reduce the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth when compared with control (104462).\nless\nSepsis. Most research shows that oral vitamin A does not reduce the risk of sepsis in premature infants.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials in premature infants shows that providing supplemental enteral vitamin A 1500-5000 IU daily, starting within four days of birth, does not reduce the incidence of sepsis when compared with placebo (109753).\nless\nTuberculosis. Oral vitamin A does not seem to improve tuberculosis disease duration or mortality.\nLow levels of vitamin A are common in patients with tuberculosis. However, taking vitamin A 2000 IU to 200,000 IU by mouth for 2-24 months does not improve symptoms, decrease disease duration, or reduce mortality when compared with placebo in these patients (82570, 103668, 109754). This may be due to the fact that vitamin A levels may normalize following the initiation of tuberculosis treatment, even without additional vitamin A supplementation.\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nHead and neck cancer. Oral vitamin A taken for 2 years does not seem to improve survival or prevent head and neck cancer recurrence.\nA large clinical study n patients with a history of head and neck cancer shows that taking vitamin A as retinyl palmitate 300,000 IU daily for 1 year, and followed by 150,000 IU daily for another year, does not reduce the risk of second primary tumors or tumor recurrence when compared with placebo. Also, vitamin A does not seem to improve survival or event-free survival (1710).\nless\nHIV transmission. Oral vitamin A does not reduce vertical HIV transmission risk. There is some concern that vitamin A might increase HIV transmission through breast milk.\nObservational and intervention research shows that taking vitamin A orally does not decrease the risk of HIV transmission to the fetus during pregnancy, to newborns during delivery, or to infants during early breast-feeding (6376, 82470, 95059). Preliminary clinical research also shows that vitamin A supplementation of pregnant adults with HIV infection might increase the risk of HIV transmission to their babies through breast milk (9801).\nless\nLower respiratory tract infections. Oral vitamin A does not reduce the risk for lower respiratory tract infections in children. It is unclear if supplementation of oral vitamin A while breast-feeding reduces the risk of lower respiratory tract infections in nursing infants.\nTaking vitamin A by mouth does not prevent or reduce symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections, such as cough and fever, in children (82288, 82443). Furthermore, some research shows that vitamin A is associated with a slight increase in the risk of respiratory tract infections when administered to children with adequate nutritional status (82288). Additionally, one small clinical trial in breast-feeding parents shows that supplementation of vitamin A 1800 IU and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 600 IU daily for 2 months does not reduce the risk of febrile illness or respiratory tract infections in the nursing infants when compared with placebo (107293).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although prescription vitamin A analogs are approved to treat acne, it is unclear if non-prescription topical vitamin A products help with acne symptoms.\nThe high-dose vitamin A analogs adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac) are prescription drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne (103712, 103713). These drugs are not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, such as retinol, which have not been extensively evaluated in clinical research. A small preliminary clinical trial in adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate acne shows that applying topical benzoyl peroxide 2.5% each morning and a topical retinol plus salicylic acid product each evening for 12 weeks modestly improves acne severity and other measures of complexion when compared with baseline. All patients also used the same cleanser twice daily (109748). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. Oral vitamin A has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis shows that taking vitamin A in combination with coenzyme Q10 and other vitamins and minerals daily for 6 months does not improve survival when compared with placebo (61392).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for preventing asthma in children.\nAn observational study in children has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a lower risk of asthma. Children in the highest quartile of vitamin A intake (median of 2267 IU daily) at 7 years of age had improved lung function and 32% lower odds of asthma at 11-14 years of age when compared with children in the lowest quartile of vitamin A intake (median of 870 IU daily) (107291).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if supplementation of oral vitamin A while breast-feeding is beneficial for preventing eczema in nursing infants.\nOne small clinical trial in breast-feeding parents shows that supplementation of vitamin A 1800 IU and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 600 IU daily for 2 months does not reduce the risk of eczema in the nursing infants when compared with placebo (107293).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for improving symptoms of autism.\nChildren with autism spectrum disorder are at increased risk for vitamin A deficiency, and vitamin A levels have been inversely associated with autism symptoms. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of vitamin A 200,000 IU slightly improves emotional response, communication, and other symptoms when compared to baseline (97168). The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings. Another preliminary clinical study in children with autism and vitamin A deficiency shows that taking vitamin A 50,000 IU weekly for 6 months, but not as a single dose of 200,000 IU, seems to improve social impairment scores when compared with control. Controls were children with autism without vitamin A deficiency that did not take a supplement (104459).\nless\nBreast cancer. Although vitamin A intake has been associated with a reduced risk for breast cancer, it is unclear if vitamin A supplements are beneficial.\nEpidemiological evidence has found an association between high intake of vitamin A and a reduced risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the adults with the highest intake of vitamin A, either from diet alone or also from supplements, reduces the odds of developing breast cancer by 16% when compared with the lowest intake (1444, 34610, 109752). However, the effects of supplemental vitamin A, specifically, are unclear.\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for cataract prevention.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a modestly reduced risk of cataracts (6378, 112095). Also, other population research has found that the highest dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a 17% lower risk of cataracts when compared with the lowest intakes (90786). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between blood levels of vitamin A and the risk of cataracts (90786, 90944). It is not known if supplemental vitamin A is beneficial for this purpose.\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for cervical cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that increased vitamin A levels in the blood or higher vitamin A intakes are associated with a reduced risk of cervical cancer. However, this effect is observed when both forms of vitamin A, either retinol or carotenoids, are considered. When only the retinol form is considered, vitamin A supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of cervical cancer (34613, 109752). Also, a meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that vitamin A intake, either from diet alone or supplements, does not affect the risk of cervical cancer (109752).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral vitamin A helps to prevent diarrhea caused by chemotherapy.\nA very small clinical study in children receiving chemotherapy shows that taking vitamin A orally does not seem to prevent GI adverse effects, including diarrhea and mouth pain, when compared with control (9802).\nless\nChild development. Oral vitamin A might improve growth and development in children with vitamin A deficiency, but not in those with good nutritional status.\nSupplementing with vitamin A 60 mg for up to 9 years does not promote or improve child growth in children with appropriate nutritional status (20132). However, in children with vitamin A deficiency, supplementation with vitamin A may improve growth (82246).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is limited evidence on the oral use of vitamin A in patients with emphysema.\nObservational research has found that consuming recommended amounts of vitamin A in the diet is associated with 33% lower odds of developing emphysema (103678).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for cognitive function.\nA large clinical trial in schoolchildren in Ethiopia, most without vitamin A deficiency, shows that taking vitamin A 200,000 IU at baseline and after 5 months improves working memory, but not other measures of cognitive development, when compared with placebo (113904). However, results are unlikely to be clinically significant.\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral vitamin A has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination supplement containing selenium, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E orally daily for 5 years or until the recurrence of an adenoma reduces the risk of recurrent large-bowel adenomas by about 40% when compared with placebo in patients with large-bowel adenomas (92903). It is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin A or other constituents.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nTaking vitamin A alone or in combination with beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (12185).\nless\nCorneal abrasion. It is unclear if topical vitamin A is beneficial for preventing corneal abrasion during surgery.\nA clinical study in patients undergoing general anesthesia for non-ophthalmic surgery shows that applying a specific vitamin A containing gel (Ziyang® Vitamin A Palmitate Eye Gel, Shenyang Xingqi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) to the ocular surface prior to eye taping decreases evidence of corneal abrasion and increases tear production 30 minutes after surgery when compared with taping without vitamin A gel. However, by 24 hours there was no difference between the two eyes (114501).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral vitamin A improves recovery after CABG surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin A 5000 IU daily (as retinol palmitate) for 21 days starting on the day of CABG surgery reduces time in intensive care after surgery by 46% to 69% compared to a control group not given vitamin A (90783). Supplementation with vitamin A also improves total hospitalization time for those patients with adequate zinc status (90783).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19.\nClinical research in COVID-19 outpatients treated with hydroxychloroquine shows that taking vitamin A 25,000 IU daily for 10 days modestly reduces the number of patients with symptoms of fever, body ache, and fatigue when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the number of patients with cough, shortness of breath, lack of appetite, chest pain, diarrhea, loss of smell, or headache (109745).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for depression.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that dietary intake of vitamin A is inversely associated with depression. The highest intake of vitamin A was associated with a 17% reduced risk of depression when compared with the lowest intake. Also, vitamin A intake was lower in individuals with depression (109743). The effect of vitamin A supplementation is unclear.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention.\nObservational research has found that higher beta-carotene and vitamin A intake is associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer (34551, 103675). However, evidence from higher-quality clinical research shows that taking vitamin A in combination with beta-carotene does not reduce the risk of esophageal cancer (12185).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nTaking vitamin A alone and in combination with beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of gastric cancer (12185).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for glaucoma prevention.\nMeta-analyses of observational research suggests that a high dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a 37% reduced risk or 42% lower odds of glaucoma when compared with a low intakes (109742, 112095).\nless\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It is unclear if taking vitamin A prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) decreases the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD.\nA clinical study in patients 1-28 years of age with serum vitamin A levels below the 75th percentile shows that taking a single oral dose of vitamin A 4000 IU/kg (maximum dose: 250,000 IU) approximately 1 week before allogenic HSCT decreases the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year to 5%, compared with 12.5% in those taking placebo. However, patients who took vitamin A did not have a lower rate of acute GVHD or acute gastrointestinal GVHD at 100 or 180 days when compared with placebo. All patients in this study with low vitamin D levels also received vitamin D supplementation per an institutional protocol (114498).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for improving HIV/AIDs outcomes.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials and population research shows that maternal vitamin A supplementation of mothers with poor vitamin A status at baseline does not influence child or maternal mortality, hospitalization rate, or HIV/AIDS progression. However, pediatric vitamin A supplementation seems to decrease mortality rates in children with HIV/AIDS when compared with placebo (34529, 95059).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related diarrhea. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for preventing diarrhea associated with HIV.\nA large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin A can decrease the rate of diarrhea-specific mortality by up to 92% in vitamin A-deficient children with or without HIV/AIDS (1465). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin A does not significantly reduce diarrhea-specific mortality when only children with HIV/AIDS are considered (82511). But vitamin A does appear to reduce overall mortality in these children by 50% to 63% (1465, 82511).\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if topical or oral vitamin A is beneficial for the resolution of genital warts caused by HPV.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with genital warts suggests that the oral prescription drugs isotretinoin and etretinate might promote resolution of warts when compared with baseline. However, the topical prescription drug tretinoin 0.05% cream does not seem to help (104460). These drugs are not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, such as retinol.\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin A improves the development of low birth weight infants.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that giving intramuscular vitamin A to very low birth weight infants reduces the risk of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age by about 13% compared to control (95053). Preliminary clinical research also shows that giving intramuscular vitamin A along with inhaled nitric oxide gas for 3 weeks to low birth weight infants on mechanical ventilation might improve mental development at one year in some of these patients when compared with inhaled nitric oxide gas alone (90778). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intramuscular vitamin A does not improve neurodevelopment in very low birth weight infants (95053).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of anemia due to iron deficiency.\nSome research in children and pregnant adults without anemia shows that taking vitamin A increases plasma levels of hemoglobin and ferritin, and may reduce the risk of developing anemia (9518, 34627). However, another study in pregnant patients, half of whom had anemia at baseline and half of whom did not have anemia, shows that taking 3000 mcg retinol orally in combination with iron and folate does not improve hemoglobin or erythropoietin concentrations when compared with taking iron and folate (9188). In preterm infants with existing anemia, taking vitamin A 5000 IU and vitamin B complex 40 mg daily improves serum ferritin, hemoglobin, and reticulocyte levels and reduces the need for blood transfusions when compared with taking either vitamin alone. Taking vitamin A alone, however, does not improve these outcomes (100330).\nless\nLeukemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for leukemia prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia shows that taking a specific vitamin A product (Aquasol, Armour Pharmaceuticals) 50,000 IU orally daily in combination with busulfan therapy does not significantly increase progression-free survival or overall survival when compared with busulfan alone. Furthermore, supplementation with vitamin A plus busulfan seems to increase the percentage of patients who experience grade 2 toxicity by about 5-fold when compared with busulfan alone (82652).\nless\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for liver cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that vitamin A supplementation or serum levels of vitamin A are not associated with the risk of liver cancer (97169).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for lung cancer treatment or prevention.\nA large clinical trial in patients with existing lung cancer shows that vitamin A 300,000 IU daily for one year followed by 150,000 IU daily for a second year does not increase survival (1710). However, some clinical research shows that high-dose vitamin A 300,000 IU daily following curative lung cancer resection reduces the risk of new primary tumors in patients heavily exposed to tobacco (7875).\n\nObservational research on the relationship between vitamin A and lung cancer risk is conflicting. One large observational study suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. Specifically, each quartile increase in dietary vitamin A intake was associated with a 15%, 25%, and 37% lower relative risk of lung cancer when compared with the lowest intake. However, taking vitamin A in supplement form was not associated with lung cancer risk (112096). Other observational research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin A is not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer (35628). Furthermore, supplementation with vitamin A and beta-carotene seems to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers or those exposed to asbestos (2642, 34675).\nless\nMalaria. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for reducing symptoms of malaria in young children.\nTaking vitamin A orally seems to help decrease symptoms of malaria in children less than 3 years of age living in endemic areas (1464). However, other clinical research shows that single doses of vitamin A 100,000 to 200,000 IU do not improve coma resolution, convulsions, fever, parasite clearance, or mortality in infants and children less than 5 years of age with cerebral malaria (90785).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for reducing fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis receiving interferon beta-1a shows that taking vitamin A 25,000 IU (as retinyl palmitate) (Zahravi Pharmaceutical) daily for 6 months followed by 10,000 IU daily for 6 months, improves physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fatigue when compared with placebo (95052).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). A meta-analysis of several small clinical trials suggests that intramuscular vitamin A does not seem to prevent NEC.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in very low birth weight infants shows that intramuscular administration of vitamin A 1500-5000 IU every other day or three times weekly for 28 days does not reduce the risk of NEC when compared with a control (107297).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention.\nPopulation research has found that intake of vitamin A at levels above 2330 mcg daily is associated with a 17% lower risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with those whose daily intake of vitamin A is less than 642 mcg per day (90945).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for nonmelanoma skin cancer prevention.\nObservational research over 26 years found that higher dietary vitamin A intake is associated with a 12% reduced risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in healthy patients when compared with lower vitamin A intake (101673).\nless\nOral clefts. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for oral cleft prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that periconceptional use of vitamin A, from diet and/or supplements, is associated with a 13% reduced incidence of cleft lip alone or with a cleft palate, but is not associated with the risk of cleft palate alone, in the child (109751).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral vitamin A has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific product containing vitamin A in combination with selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E (Selenium ACE, Carls-Berghs Farmaceutiska AB) does not appear to alleviate symptoms when compared with placebo (74449).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention.\nMost observational research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin A is associated with a reduced risk of developing ovarian cancer (9193, 103679, 109752). The most recent meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that adults with the highest intake of vitamin A, either from diet alone or supplements, reduces the odds of developing ovarian cancer by 19% when compared with the lowest intake (109752).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that higher intake of vitamin A is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer; however, this benefit appears to be limited to only hospital-based cases and studies conducted in Europe (95060). In contrast, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin A in combination with beta-carotene does not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer (12185).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin A prevents Parkinson disease development.\nPopulation research has found that blood levels or dietary intake of vitamin A are not associated with the risk of Parkinson disease (91164).\nless\nPhotoreactive keratectomy. Oral vitamin A has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Evitex capsules, Alcon) containing vitamin A along with vitamin E seems to improve healing after photoreactive keratectomy. High dose (50,000 to 75,000 IU) vitamin A in the form of retinol palmitate taken daily with vitamin E (alpha-tocopheryl nicotinate) 460-590 mg daily seems to accelerate re-epithelialization, reduce haze formation, and improve visual acuity in patients undergoing laser surgery for myopia (348).\nless\nPneumonia. Oral vitamin A does not seem to prevent mortality related to pneumonia in children. However, it is unclear if vitamin A reduces symptom severity and hospitalization in children.\nClinical research in children living in developing countries shows that taking vitamin A orally does not prevent mortality related to pneumonia (1466, 82362, 82504, 82717, 109749). However, the evidence related to symptom duration and severity is mixed. A large study and early meta-analyses show that vitamin A does not prevent pneumonia or decrease the severity or length of hospitalization in children with pneumonia (1466, 82362, 82504, 82717). A more recent meta-analysis also shows that giving vitamin A to children at or below 5 years of age does not affect the duration of hospitalization (109755). The best evidence to date comes from a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. This meta-analysis shows that, when given in combination with conventional therapy to children up to 10 years of age, vitamin A reduces the duration of symptoms including fever, cough, lung rale, and shortness of breath, as well as the duration of hospitalization and time to a negative X-ray, when compared with conventional therapy alone (109749). However, the number of trials evaluating each endpoint is small and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if vitamin A reduces the duration of hospitalization for premature infants.\nA meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials in preterm infants shows that providing supplemental enteral vitamin A 1500-5000 IU daily, starting within four days of birth, does not reduce the duration of hospitalization when compared with placebo (109750).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for prostate cancer prevention.\nObservational studies suggest that dietary intake of vitamin A is not associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (14134).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical vitamin A is beneficial for psoriasis symptoms.\nThe vitamin A analog tazarotene (Tazorac) is a prescription drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat stable plaque psoriasis covering up to 20% body surface area (103713). This drug is not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, such as retinol.\nless\nRadiation proctopathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin A is beneficial for reducing chronic radiation proctopathy symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients experiencing chronic radiation proctopathy caused by pelvic radiotherapy shows that taking retinol palmitate 10,000 IU daily for 90 days might reduce rectal symptoms when compared with placebo (82350).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Most small studies show that oral or intramuscular vitamin A does not reduce the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\nA meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in very low birth weight infants shows that intramuscular administration of vitamin A 2000-10,000 IU every other day or three times weekly, or oral vitamin A 2000 IU daily, for 28 days does not reduce the risk of ROP when compared with a control (107297). Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that providing supplemental enteral vitamin A 1500 IU or an average of 5000 IU daily, starting within four days of birth, does not reduce the incidence of severe ROP (109750, 109753). However, a very small clinical study in preterm infants, which was not included in the meta-analysis, shows that receiving retinol palmitate drops 3000 IU/kg daily for 28 days reduces the risk of ROP by 88% when compared with no treatment (103672).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if vitamin A is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of URTIs in young children.\nA meta-analysis of 3 low-quality clinical studies in children under 7 years of age living in low- to middle-income countries found that there is no association between vitamin A supplementation and rate of acute URTI, although this finding was considered to be of low certainty. There was insufficient data to determine whether vitamin A may reduce the severity of URTI symptoms (114499). The interpretation of findings is limited by high heterogeneity of the study populations and dosing regimens, as well as variability in selected outcomes.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if adding oral vitamin A to antibiotic therapy is beneficial for symptoms of acute pyelonephritis in young females.\nA small clinical study in females 2-12 years of age with a first occurrence of acute pyelonephritis shows that taking vitamin A 1500 units/kg daily for 10 days in conjunction with antibiotics decreases the duration of fever by about 1.3 days and reduces urinary frequency by about 1.5 episodes per day when compared to taking placebo with antibiotics. Taking vitamin A might also reduce the occurrence of moderate or severe renal scarring after 6 months when compared with placebo (100327). The validity of these findings is limited by small study size and a high dropout rate.\nless\nWarts. It is unclear if topical or oral vitamin A improves the resolution of viral warts.\nA meta-analysis of observational and clinical research in patients with viral warts suggests that receiving prescription oral retinoids (isotretinoin, acitretin, etretinate) seems to produce a 61% rate of wart resolution. Prescription topical retinoids seems to produce a 64% rate of wart resolution (104461). These drugs are not interchangeable with non-prescription, commercially available vitamin A products, such as retinol.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin A for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) levels for adults are 900 mcg/day in males and 700 mcg/day in females. For pregnant patients, the RDA is 770 mcg/day; for lactating patients, the RDA is 1300 mcg/day (7135). As with other fat-soluble vitamins, dietary fat increases the absorption of vitamin A (7135). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nVitamin A dosage is most commonly expressed in IU, but dosage in micrograms is sometimes used. One mcg of vitamin A equals 3.33 IU of vitamin A. Vitamin A recommendations are for retinol, or pre-formed vitamin A. Formerly, vitamin A RDA recommendations were expressed as retinol equivalents (RE) to account for the differences in bioconversion of the various vitamin A forms to retinol. Retinol activity equivalents (RAE) are now used: 1 mcg of retinol equals 1 RAE which equals 2 mcg supplemental beta-carotene, 12 mcg of dietary beta-carotene, and 24 mcg dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin. Either pre-formed vitamin A from animal products (retinol) or provitamin A carotenoids from plant products is an acceptable vitamin A source, although provitamin A carotenoids must be consumed in larger quantities (7135). Consumption of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day supplies 5-6 mg per day of provitamin A carotenoids, which provides about 50% to 65% of the adult RDA for vitamin A (7135).\nTopical:\nVitamin A has been used topically in different formulations such as creams, serums, and lotions. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Adequate Intake (AI) levels for children are based on age: AI: birth to 6 months, 400 mcg daily; 7 to 12 months, 500 mcg daily; RDA: 1 to 3 years, 300 mcg daily; 4 to 8 years, 400 mcg daily; 9 to 13 years, 600 mcg daily; males 14 years and older, 900 mcg daily; females 14 years and older, 700 mcg daily. For pregnant patients 14 to 18 years of age, the RDA is 750 mcg daily; for lactating patients 14 to 18 years of age, the RDA is 1200 mcg daily (7135). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nThere is some evidence that oral vitamin A supplementation might increase the risk of pneumonia and diarrhea in children. Although vitamin A can prevent diarrhea and reduce mortality in malnourished children, doses as low as 10,000 IU weekly for 40 weeks have been associated with pneumonia and diarrhea in well-nourished children (319). In preschool children, high-dose vitamin A also increases the risk of respiratory infection (82288).\nStandardization & Formulation\nVitamin A used in clinical research has included oral, topical, and injectable products. Most dosing recommendations for vitamin A are for pre-formed vitamin A (retinol). One mcg of vitamin A equals 3.33 IU of vitamin A. To convert between pre-formed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids, retinol activity equivalents (RAE) are currently used, with 1 mcg of retinol equal to 1 RAE (7135).",

            "Interactions with Supplements": "IRON\nVitamin A might improve the effectiveness of iron supplementation in people with low iron and low vitamin A levels.\nLow levels of vitamin A have been associated with inadequate iron absorption and metabolism. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin A supplements seems to improve iron absorption from food and improve hemoglobin levels in people with anemia and low serum retinol levels. It's unlikely that vitamin A supplements would have significant effects on iron status in people without vitamin A deficiency (9518, 9569, 9586, 95057).\nless",

There is some evidence that chronic and excessive ethanol intake induces cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) metabolism of vitamin A, which can increase the production of hepatotoxic and carcinogenic vitamin A metabolites (1488, 7135, 7139).\nless\nFAT MALABSORPTION DISORDERS\nOral vitamin A absorption is decreased in conditions where fat absorption is reduced, such as celiac disease, short gut syndrome, obstructive jaundice, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic disease, and cirrhosis of the liver (7135, 95054, 95058). Water-miscible oral vitamin A preparations should be used in patients with fat malabsorption disorders.\nless\nIRON DEFICIENCY\nIron deficiency may impair the metabolism of vitamin A (95057).\nless\nLIVER DISEASE\nPatients with liver disease can have an increased risk of hypervitaminosis and hepatotoxicity, especially if they take excessive doses of vitamin A (7135).\nless\nMALNUTRITION\nSevere protein malnutrition might lead to vitamin A hypervitaminosis.

Some studies have reported a fall in serum vitamin A levels, but they rarely fall below the normal range with therapy of up to 2 years' duration (4455, 4457, 4460). Since some of the vitamin A in plasma is carried on lipids, part of this fall in plasma vitamin A levels may be due to decreased plasma lipid levels (4457, 4460). Other studies have reported no change in plasma vitamin A levels with colestipol, up to 30 grams/day for 6 months, or cholestyramine 12 to 24 grams/day for up to 10 years (4461, 10566, 10567, 10568, 10569). Routine vitamin A supplements aren't necessary in people taking bile acid sequestrants, but check vitamin A levels in people taking high doses for more than 2 years. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin A, see our chart.\nless\nMINERAL OIL\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nMineral oil might modestly reduce absorption and levels of vitamin A.\nMineral oil has been reported to reduce absorption of all fat-soluble vitamins (4454, 4495). However, there was no change in serum vitamin A levels in children who used mineral oil for up to four months (4496). Mineral oil should not be used on a regular basis due to its side effects; however, its effect on vitamin A levels with occasional use is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nless\nNEOMYCIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nNeomycin might modestly reduce levels of vitamin A.\nNeomycin can bind and precipitate fatty acids and bile acids in the gut, reducing fat absorption. There is limited evidence that this can affect fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Single doses of neomycin reduced absorption of large doses (300,000 units) of vitamin A given concurrently (10565). However, there was no change in serum vitamin A levels in adults who took neomycin 1-2 grams/day for 18 weeks for treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia (10566). It's unlikely that neomycin will cause clinically significant vitamin A depletion.\nless\nORLISTAT (Xenical, Alli)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nOrlistat might reduce absorption and levels of vitamin A.\nOrlistat can decrease absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin A, leading to low plasma levels in some patients (1730). Several studies suggest that vitamin A is not affected as much by orlistat as some other fat-soluble vitamins (1727, 9595, 10570, 10571). However, the manufacturer of orlistat recommends that all patients take a multivitamin supplement containing all the fat-soluble vitamins, separating the dosing time by at least 2 hours from orlistat (1730).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nHypervitaminosis A sometimes occurs when vitamin A is taken in doses above the UL. Acute hypervitaminosis A may occur in adults and children when vitamin A is taken at doses 100 times greater and 20 times greater than the RDA, respectively. Chronic hypervitaminosis A can occur with intake of vitamin A at doses of >25,000 IU daily for more than 6 years or 100,000 IU daily for more than 6 months (94644). However, the amount of vitamin A that causes chronic toxicity is influenced by patient-specific factors such as dosing regimen, vitamin form, chronic conditions, and food intake (10560).\n\nHypervitaminosis A may cause various dermatologic symptoms (15, 7135, 95051). Other symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting (7135, 82326, 82389, 82559, 95051, 109755). Hepatotoxicity associated with oral vitamin A has resulted in death (6377, 7135). Hypervitaminosis A can increase the risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (7712, 7713, 9190), bone pain (95051), as well as lung infections (319, 82288). Other side effects include headache, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, vertigo, blurred vision, irritability, drowsiness, dizziness, delirium, coma, swelling of the optic disk, bulging eyeballs, fever, sweating, failure to gain weight or weight loss, and visual disturbances (15, 7135). Hypervitaminosis A can cause spider angiomas, anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia (15, 95051), as well as symptoms mimicking depression or schizophrenic disorder (7135).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with vitamin A.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn the plasma, vitamin A is bound to retinol-binding protein (95053). Dietary retinyl esters are hydrolyzed by pancreatic and intestinal enzymes. Unesterified retinol is directly absorbed in to intestinal cells, mostly by active transport at lower concentrations and by diffusion at higher concentrations (9186, 9187). There seem to be differences in the absorption of various forms of vitamin A, but more research is needed to determine the clinical significance (9187). It is estimated that 70-90% of preformed vitamin A is absorbed (95051).\nDistribution\nThe liver seems to maintain vitamin A concentrations within a relatively narrow range by storage and release of vitamin A (9595). Ingested vitamin A is stored in the body as retinol, predominantly in the liver, but also in the retina, kidneys, lungs, adrenal glands, and intraperitoneal fat (1467, 95051). The liver may contain up to a 2-year supply of vitamin A (95058). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is required to transport retinol from the liver and accumulates in the liver during periods of vitamin A deficiency (6377). When vitamin A as retinol is available, it binds to accumulated RBP and is promptly released into the blood when needed (6377). A serum retinol level of 1.05 micromoles/liter or less is considered normal. Serum retinol levels increase with age (9197). Transport protein levels can be reduced in people with protein malnutrition, causing signs of vitamin A deficiency (9197). Vitamin A supplementation also increases retinol levels in breast milk (82188, 82229, 100328, 109744).\nMetabolism\nIn the body, vitamin A is metabolized to 11-cis-retinoids and acidic retinoids (90778). In alcoholism, vitamin A deficiency is common since alcohol accelerates the breakdown of retinol through induction of cytochrome isoenzymes and interferes with the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol (1488, 7139). The intestinal carotenoid-to-retinol conversion ratio can vary with the type of food, so dietary intake of plants may not produce sufficient quantities of vitamin A (95055). Roughly 50% of carotenoids can be metabolized into active retinoid forms (95054).\nExcretion\nThe majority of vitamin A is excreted in the urine. Lesser amounts are lost through the breath and feces, as inactive metabolites (7135). In vitamin A excess, biliary excretion increases (7135).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. Vitamin A includes a family of molecules containing a 20-carbon structure with various chemical groups at the 15 carbon position. Variations at the 15 carbon position yield different vitamin A forms, including retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl ester. These different forms of vitamin A are often collectively referred to as \"retinoids.\" The most potent form of vitamin A, all-trans retinol, is the form of retinol in the diet. It reverses signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and is the standard for vitamin A activity (9191). The vitamin A family also includes provitamin A carotenoids, which are dietary precursors to retinol.\n\nVitamin A is found in foods in several forms. Retinol, also called preformed vitamin A, is present in esterified form in animal-derived products including fish and animal liver, eggs, whole milk, butter, fortified margarine, meat, and oily saltwater fish (7135). Animal liver contains the highest amount of dietary retinol. About two-thirds of vitamin A intake comes from dietary retinol (9189). Fresh water fish contain a form of vitamin A called 3-dehydroretinol, but have only 30% to 40% of the biologic activity of retinol (15). About a third of dietary vitamin A comes from plants, which synthesize carotenoids that are converted to vitamin A in the body (7135). Carotenoid pigments (including alpha-, beta-, and gamma-carotene and cryptoxanthin) are present in grains, oils, green and yellow vegetables, and especially in carrots and fruits (8044). The amount of carotenoids absorbed and converted to vitamin A depends upon the amount of carotenoids ingested, the individual's vitamin A status, and carotenoid body stores (8044).\n\nVitamin A is required for vision, growth and bone development, reproduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, immune function, and the integrity of mucosal and epithelial surfaces. All-trans retinol is converted in the body to all-trans retinoic acid by an unknown mechanism. All-trans retinoic acid is the active form of vitamin A in almost all biological processes. Retinoic acid regulates the expression of various genes that encode for structural proteins, such as keratins in the skin; enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase; extracellular matrix proteins, such as the basement membrane protein laminin; and retinol binding proteins and receptors (7135, 9189, 95051). Vitamin A also regulates genes, including those of the dopaminergic system, in the brain and central nervous system (91164). Vitamin A acts as a cofactor in mucopolysaccharide synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, hydroxysteroid metabolism, and glycoprotein glycosylation (15).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro studies suggest that retinoids might help prevent cancer by inducing tumor suppressor genes known as retinoic acid receptors (RAR). Tumor suppressor gene RAR-beta2 is absent in many malignant tumor cells, possibly due to methylation of the gene. When demethylated, the RAR-beta2 gene can be induced by retinoic acid to function and suppress growth of cancer cells (6380, 6381). However, there is evidence that some forms of retinoic acid, such as all-trans-retinoic acid, do not use the RAR receptor to inhibit cancer growth and may use other mechanisms and pathways to inhibit growth (8045). There is also evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by certain statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with 13-cis retinoic acid (8046). Ethanol may compete with retinol for alcohol dehydrogenase and inhibit retinoic acid synthesis, interfering with normal retinoid signaling of RAR genes and cause malignant transformation of hepatic cells (6377). Preliminary evidence suggests that all-trans-retinoic acid applied topically might help protect the skin against UV radiation damage. UV radiation seems to cause a functional vitamin A deficiency in the skin (1468). Vitamin A acts an antioxidant, and may play a role in free radical scavenging, decreasing oxidative stress, and stimulating immune function in cancer (95060).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nVitamin A seems to have both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. In humans, vitamin A supplementation increases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). However, vitamin A supplementation does not affect blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin (IL)-6 (109746) in some studies, while in other studies it lowers IL-6 and IL-8 (114498).\nBone effects\nBoth human and animal studies suggest excessive vitamin A intake can have a negative effect on bone (7712, 9190, 9191, 9192). Retinoic acid receptors are found on osteoblasts and osteoclasts (95051). Vitamin A seems to suppress osteoblast activity, stimulate osteoclast formation, and antagonize the ability of vitamin D to maintain normal serum calcium levels (7712, 9190, 9191, 9192). Some evidence suggests that older people can't metabolize vitamin A as well younger people, which could increase the risk of osteoporosis (9191).\nConcurrent effects of vitamin E\nBased on cell culture and animal studies, it's been suggested that vitamin E affects the activity of vitamin A. These include preventing oxidation in the gut and increasing absorption, enhancing utilization, promoting liver storage, protecting against cell damage caused by high vitamin A levels, and reducing some of the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A (10545, 10557, 10558, 10560). Supportive data in humans is very limited. There is some preliminary evidence that vitamin E increases the effects of vitamin A in the treatment of some skin conditions (10562). Small studies have reported increased vitamin A absorption and excretion, and both increases and decreases in vitamin A levels when vitamin E is taken concurrently (10559, 10561, 10563, 10564). Despite the lack of good evidence of efficacy or necessity, vitamin E has been added to the intermittent, high doses of vitamin A sometimes used to treat deficiency in developing countries (10558, 10560). Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin E affects the activity of vitamin A in humans.\nDermatologic effects\nVitamin A deficiency is associated with follicular hyperkeratosis (7135). Topically, retinoids are used to reduce inflammation and to normalize follicular keratinocyte differentiation (82576).\nEmbryonic development\nIn embryonic development, vitamin A plays an important role in neural development, and is also involved in the development of the limbs, lung, heart, eyes, and ears (7135, 11978). However, excessive vitamin A is teratogenic, causing central nervous system, craniofacial, cardiovascular, and thymus malformations (11978).\nHematologic effects\nVitamin A is important for the normal utilization of iron and prevention of anemia. Deficiency of vitamin A impairs maturation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Vitamin A may facilitate mobilization of body stores of iron. Preliminary evidence also indicates that vitamin A and beta-carotene enhance non-heme iron absorption from iron-fortified wheat and corn flour, and rice. In addition, vitamin A appears to be involved with production of erythropoietin by the liver and kidney (9518, 9569, 9586, 95057).\nImmunologic effects\nVitamin A is important for immune function. Retinoic acid is required in maintaining sufficient levels of natural killer cells, and preliminary evidence suggests that retinoic acid might increase the production of cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1). Additionally, B lymphocyte growth, differentiation, and activation are dependent on retinol (7135). Vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased risk of infectious morbidity and mortality (7135). Some research has linked retinol deficiency to development of cervical neoplasms in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (9800).\n\nVitamin A deficiency seems to adversely affect fetal immune status. Maternal-fetal transmission of HIV is higher in the presence of low vitamin A status (11978). However, vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to affect the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in mothers positive for HIV not currently on anti-retroviral therapy (95059). Other research shows that supplementing pregnant adults with vitamin A 10,000 IU daily, starting prior to the administration of the H1N1 influenza vaccination and continuing for 6 months postpartum, increases H1N1 immunity titers in mothers, but not in their infants (100328).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin A for complications of multiple sclerosis (MS). Certain complications such as fatigue and depression may be secondary to inflammation. Retinoic acids may suppress the proliferation of pathogenic T cells that are present in MS and may increase production of regulatory cells that modulate the immune system. Retinoic acids have been shown to stimulate anti-inflammatory effects, downregulate gene expression of inflammatory cytokines, change levels of retinoic acid receptors found on mononuclear cells, and shift the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2, which secretes anti-inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, retinoic acids may also lead to neuroregeneration (95052). In addition to fatigue, inflammatory products also lead to changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neurons, which could further contribute to depression (95052).\nOcular effects\nVitamin A is necessary for the maintenance of the epithelium of the conjunctiva and cornea. It's also necessary for epithelial RNA synthesis (95058). In the retina, retinol is converted to cis-retinal, which combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, the visual pigment. Retinal is required by the eye for the transduction of light into the neural signals that produce vision. The most specific indicator of vitamin A deficiency is xerophthalmia, which is initially manifested by night blindness that progresses to complete visual loss if untreated (7135, 95058).\nPulmonary effects\nVitamin A is necessary for normal lung growth and function of respiratory tract cells (95053). Retinol seems to affect pulmonary function. Higher retinol levels have been associated with higher forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (9195). In animal research, vitamin A increases surfactant production in the lungs and increases alveolarization (90778). A fetus accumulates vitamin A during the 3rd trimester. As such, preterm infants have decreased levels of vitamin A at birth, which increases the risk of developing chronic lung disease (95053).\nToxic effects\nVitamin A toxicity can occur when vitamin A intake exceeds the storage capacity of the liver or when liver function is compromised. Vitamin A is released into the circulation as retinyl esters rather than bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP). The retinyl esters expose target tissues to free retinol, resulting in the damaging effects of hypervitaminosis A (9196).\nWound healing effects\nVitamin A seems to have the opposite effect of steroids on wound healing. It stimulates the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and increases collagen production, resulting in improved wound healing (320)."

    "Vitamin B12": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products (74154). It is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin, which must be metabolized to the active form, is the most common form used in supplements (74154, 90948). Reportedly, vitamin B12 was discovered by George Whipple while trying to find a cure for pernicious anemia (82798, 82828).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally, topically, intravenously, intramuscularly, or intranasally and appropriately. Vitamin B12 is generally considered safe, even in large doses (15, 1344, 1345, 1346, 1347, 1348, 2909, 6243, 7289, 7881)(9414, 9416, 10126, 14392, 15765, 82832, 82949, 82860, 82864, 90386)(111334, 111551).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA for vitamin B12 during pregnancy is 2.6 mcg daily (6243). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger amounts of vitamin B12 during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA of vitamin B12 during lactation is 2.8 mcg daily (6243). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger amounts of vitamin B12 while breastfeeding.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, intramuscularly, and topically, vitamin B12 is generally well-tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nIntramuscular: Injection site reactions.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nIntramuscularly: Severe hypokalemia has been rarely linked with correction of megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B12.\nCardiovascular\nIn human clinical research, an intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, followed by daily oral administration after coronary stenting, increased restenosis rates (12150). Hypertension following intravenous administration of hydroxocobalamin has been reported in human research (82870, 82864).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally or intramuscularly, vitamin B12 can cause allergic reactions such as rash, pruritus, erythema, and urticaria. Theoretically, allergic reactions might be caused by the cobalt within the vitamin B12 molecule (82864, 90373, 90381, 103974). In one case report, oral methylcobalamin resulted in contact dermatitis in a 59-year-old Japanese female with a cobalt allergy (103974). In another case report, a 69-year-old female developed a symmetrical erythematous-squamous rash for 5 years after oral vitamin B12 supplementation for 10 years. A patch test confirmed that the systemic allergic dermatitis was due to vitamin B12 supplementation, which resolved 3 months after discontinuation (114578).\n\nVitamin B12 (intramuscular or oral) has also been associated with at least 19 cases of acneiform eruptions which resolved upon discontinuation of vitamin B12 (90365, 90369, 90388). High-dose vitamin B12 (20 mcg daily) and vitamin B6 (80 mg daily) have been associated with cases of rosacea fulminans characterized by intense erythema with nodules, papules, and pustules. Symptoms may last up to four months after the supplement is stopped and can be treated with systemic corticosteroids and topical therapy (10998, 82870, 82871).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIntravenously, vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 2.5-10 grams can cause nausea and dysphagia (82864).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIntravenously, vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 5-15 grams has been associated with chromaturia in clinical research (82870, 82871, 112282, 112264).\nless\nHematologic\nAccording to case report data, the correction of megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B12 may result in fatal hypokalemia (82914).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nAccording to case report data, correction of megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B12 has precipitated gout in susceptible individuals (82879).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nTreatment with vitamin B12 has been rarely associated with involuntary movements in infants with vitamin B12 deficiency (90370, 90385, 90397). In some cases these adverse reactions were misdiagnosed as seizures or infantile tremor syndrome (90370, 90385). These adverse reactions presented 2-5 days after treatment with vitamin B12 and resolved once vitamin B12 was discontinued (90370, 90385, 90397).\nless\nOncologic\nAlthough some epidemiological research disagrees (9454), most research has found that elevated plasma levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancers and solid tumors (50411, 102383, 107743). One study found, when compared with blood levels of vitamin B12 less than 1000 ng/mL, plasma vitamin B12 levels of at least 1000 ng/mL was strongly associated with the occurrence of solid cancer (107743). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of cancer. It is possible that having cancer increases the risk of vitamin B12 elevation. However, one observational study has found that the highest quintile of dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% increased incidence of developing esophageal cancer when compared with the lowest quintile in never drinkers, but not drinkers (107147).\nless\nRenal\nThere is a case report of oxalate nephropathy in a 54-year-old male which was determined to be related to the use of intravenous hydroxocobalamin as treatment for cyanide poisoning. Intermittent hemodialysis was started 5 days after admission, along with a low-oxalate diet, oral calcium acetate, and pyridoxine 5 mg/kg daily (107148). A review of the use of intravenous hydroxocobalamin for suspected cyanide poisoning in 21 intensive care units in France between 2011 and 2017 resulted in a 60% increased odds of acute kidney injury and a 77% increased odds of severe acute kidney injury in the first week. However, biopsies were not conducted and a direct link with use of hydroxocobalamin could not be made (107139).\nless\nOther\nSeveral studies have found that higher vitamin B12 levels may be associated with increased mortality or decreased survival rates in hospitalized elderly patients (82889, 82812, 82857, 82895). Human research has also found a positive correlation between vitamin B12 status and all-cause mortality in Pima Indians with diabetes (82863).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nImerslund-Grasbeck disease. Intramuscular vitamin B12 is effective for patients with this condition.\nAdministering intramuscular vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 1 mg daily for 10 days, followed by monthly injections for the remainder of a patient's life, is effective for treating familial selective vitamin B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Grasbeck disease) (15, 82862).\nless\nVitamin B12 deficiency. Administering vitamin B12 orally, intramuscularly, or intranasally is effective for preventing and treating vitamin B12 deficiency.\nVitamin B12 deficiency has varying definitions but is often defined as vitamin B12 (cobalamin) levels less than 180-200 pmol/L (or 240 pg/mL). Some believe that only intramuscular vitamin B12 is effective for treating vitamin B12 deficiency. However, clinical research shows that oral therapy increases cobalamin levels similarly to intramuscular administration, even in patients with pernicious anemia or malabsorption, if a high enough dose is given (2909, 2911, 2915, 9335, 82832) (82836, 82949, 82860, 103976, 103972, 107141, 107144). Some evidence suggests that the most effective oral dose is between 647-1032 mcg daily (13106). However, in certain situations, intramuscular treatment might be more appropriate. Guidelines by the British Committee for Standards in Hematology recommend only intramuscular vitamin B12 for initial treatment of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with pernicious anemia, malabsorption disorders, or neurological involvement (94722). Intramuscular vitamin B12 is also appropriate in patients with diarrhea or vomiting and those likely to be nonadherent (103972).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is especially common in older adults, primarily due to lack of intrinsic factor and malabsorption (2915, 2919, 9335). Daily supplementation with vitamin B12 50-100 mcg might be needed to correct deficiency (10126), while daily doses of 25-37.5 mcg help to maintain normal levels over time (9335). In addition to supplements, foods such as milk and bread fortified with vitamin B12 can be used and are approximately 55% to 60% absorbed by people over 60 years of age (10124).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is also common in patients that have had gastric surgery, including gastrectomy and bariatric surgery (107144, 107145). Taking vitamin B12 in the doses found in multivitamins or generic vitamin B supplements does not seem to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency following bariatric surgery (107145). However, taking methylcobalamin 500 mcg daily is beneficial for treating vitamin B12 deficiency associated with a total gastrectomy and taking cyanocobalamin 5000 mcg daily is beneficial for preventing vitamin B12 deficiency following gastric bypass (107144).\n\nOther people at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency include strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) and people with increased vitamin B12 requirements associated with pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, and hepatic and kidney disease. Moderate consumption of animal products may not be sufficient to restore and maintain vitamin B12 levels, especially in adolescents who had consumed macrobiotic (vegan type) diets for the first 6 years of life. High dietary intake of vitamin B12 or supplements is usually needed in order to restore and maintain optimal vitamin B12 levels in these adolescents (10125).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCyanide poisoning. Intravenous hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) is likely effective as an antidote for patients with suspected or known cyanide toxicity due to inhalation, ingestion, or skin exposure.\nTreatment of cyanide poisoning with hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) up to 10 grams has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Australian Resuscitation Council (82870, 82905, 82906). Hydroxocobalamin is also FDA-approved for treating cyanide toxicity during pregnancy (82904).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCanker sores. Sublingual or topical vitamin B12 seems to reduce canker sore symptoms.\nClinical research in patients with canker sores shows that applying a topical ointment containing vitamin B12 500 mcg in four divided doses daily for 2 days reduces pain levels by 80% when compared with a control ointment not containing vitamin B12 (96176). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg sublingually daily for 6 months reduces the duration of canker sore outbreaks, the number of ulcers, and level of pain when compared with placebo in patients with normal vitamin B12 levels (17242).\nless\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Oral vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid, and sometimes with vitamin B6, reduces homocysteine levels.\nWhile folic acid 0.5-5 mg daily lowers fasting homocysteine levels by an average of 25%, adding vitamin B12 0.5 mg daily produces an additional decrease of about 7% on average (6883, 9400, 9401, 9405, 9409, 50145, 107136). Vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid and other vitamins also reduces homocysteine levels in patients with kidney failure, sickle cell disease, and those receiving nitrous oxide general anesthesia (1489, 6883, 6884, 7289, 7881, 9324, 9414, 9415, 9416, 9481, 82941). Some researchers recommend routine use of vitamin B12 with homocysteine-lowering regimens to avoid the risk of neuropathy in people with undetected vitamin B12 deficiency (9405). Using vitamin B12 alone has a limited effect on homocysteine levels, and probably only in those people with vitamin B12 deficiency (2147, 9410, 9512).\n\nHyperhomocysteinemia is considered by some to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, recurrent thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke (1899, 2147, 3323, 9402, 9405, 9408, 9409). Clinical research suggests that supplementation with folic acid, pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 decreases homocysteine levels and reduces the atherosclerosis progression in patients at risk for atherosclerosis when compared with placebo (50133, 50056, 82806). However, other research suggests that elevated homocysteine levels may be a marker, as opposed to a cause, of vascular disease (11387, 11388). A 5 µmol/L increase in plasma homocysteine increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease by 50%, and the odds of coronary heart disease by 60% and 80% in males and females, respectively (9407, 9411). However, it is not clear if reducing homocysteine levels results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (1489, 6883, 6884, 9400, 9405, 9409, 96417). Folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 supplementation can reduce total homocysteine from 13.4 to 11 µmol/L. However, this reduction does not seem improve endothelial function or help with secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction, and some research even suggests an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (11387, 13482, 50373, 50314, 97619).\n\nThere is also some debate about whether supplementation with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins can reduce the risk of stroke. A number of large clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with CVD or impaired kidney function (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 96150). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials including over 44,000 patients shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo in patients at risk or with a history of CVD (97619). Also, a meta-analysis in adults with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo (107136).\nless\nPostherpetic neuralgia. Subcutaneous injections of vitamin B12 seem to reduce postherpetic neuralgia symptoms.\nClinical research in patients with subacute herpetic neuralgia shows that subcutaneous injection of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 1000 mcg six times weekly for 4 weeks reduces pain when compared with oral vitamin B12 or subcutaneous lidocaine (90394). Another clinical study shows that administering local subcutaneous injections of methylcobalamin 1000 mcg plus lidocaine up to 20 mg daily for 12 injections over 14 days, starting within 7 days of the onset of subacute ophthalmic herpetic neuralgia, decreases the mean pain score by 63% to 79% when compared with intravenous lidocaine and intramuscular methylcobalamin. Less than 2 patients need to be treated to achieve a pain reduction to ≤3 out of 10. Healing of rash, itching, numbness, and tingling were also improved (96175). Additional clinical research in patients with postherpetic pain and itching shows that this same dosing regimen of subcutaneous vitamin B12 reduces pain and analgesic requirements when compared to baseline (90396).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve cognitive function in older adults when used alone or in combination with other B vitamins.\nTaking vitamin B12 100-1000 mcg plus folic acid 400-2000 mcg, with or without vitamin B6 3-50 mg, daily for up to about 2 years does not seem to improve tests of cognitive function in adults aged 65 or older, most of whom do not report cognitive impairment at baseline (14392, 50225, 50510, 90392, 107140). Also, supplementation with vitamin B12 does not seem to improve cognitive function in elderly individuals with low vitamin B12 levels (12305).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral vitamin B12, when used in combination with other B vitamins, does not seem to improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nClinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease using routine medication shows that taking vitamin B12 1 mg, folic acid 5 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg daily for 18 months does not have a beneficial effect on cognitive function or the severity of disease when compared with placebo. In this study, all patients were consuming a folate-fortified diet (50319). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia shows that taking vitamin B12, usually with other B vitamins, does not improve cognitive function (50510). Observational research has also found that higher vitamin B12 intake over 3 years in a population consuming a folate-fortified diet is not associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (15270). In contrast, preliminary clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease who are not consuming a folate-fortified diet shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily plus folic acid 1.2 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves some measures of cognitive performance and decreases levels of homocysteine when compared with placebo (107150). More research is needed to determine if any changes in this latter study are clinically relevant.\nless\nCataracts. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce cataract development.\nClinical research in women with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at increased risk of CVD shows that taking a combination of folic acid 2.5 mg daily, vitamin B6 50 mg daily, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for an average of 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of cataracts and seems to increase the risk of cataract extraction by 28% when compared with placebo (96149).\nless\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorders. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve sleep disorders.\nOral vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) does not seem to be effective for treating delayed sleep phase syndrome. Methylcobalamin 0.5-1 mg three times daily, with or without bright light therapy, also does not seem to help people with primary circadian rhythm sleep disorders (1344, 1345, 1346, 1347, 1348).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to be beneficial for older adults with cognitive impairment.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia shows that taking vitamin B12, usually with other B vitamins, does not improve cognitive function (50510). One clinical trial in elderly people with memory complaints shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, and vitamin B6 (form not specified) 20 mg daily for 24 months reduces cerebral atrophy in the gray matter regions associated with Alzheimer disease by up to seven-fold when compared with placebo. However, this protection does not occur in patients with the lowest average blood levels of homocysteine (90374).\nless\nFall prevention. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce the risk of falls.\nClinical research shows that taking B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg, daily for 2 years does not prevent falls when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D (96148).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.\nClinical research in elderly patients or patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg and folic acid 0.4-2 mg, with or without vitamin B6 25 mg, daily for 2-3 years does not seem to reduce the risk for osteoporotic fractures when compared with placebo (90377, 90393). A 5-7 year follow-up of this research has also found no benefit (103981).\nless\nPhysical performance. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve physical performance in older adults.\nClinical research shows that taking B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg, daily for 2 years does not increase hand strength or improve performance such as walking when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D (96148).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large-scale clinical study shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg, folic acid 2.5 mg, and vitamin B6 50 mg daily, reduces the risk of developing AMD in females over 40 years of age with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at least three risk factors for CVD. Those who took this combination for an average of 7.3 years had a 34% reduced risk of developing AMD and a 41% reduced risk of visually significant AMD when compared with placebo (14620). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if high-dose intramuscular vitamin B12 improves the prognosis of ALS.\nA clinical study in patients with ALS symptoms for 3 years or less shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 25-50 mg twice weekly for 3.5 years does not slow functional decline or increase the time until ventilation or death when compared with placebo. However, other clinical research in patients with early-stage ALS shows that intramuscular methylcobalamin 50 mg twice weekly for 16 weeks is associated with slower functional decline and a longer period of time until death or full ventilation when compared with placebo (104947, 111556). These effects seem to be particularly notable in fine and gross motor skills, but not bulbar or respiratory functions. Furthermore, vitamin B12 and riluzole slowed clinical progression of ALS more than riluzole alone (111556).\nless\nAngioplasty. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome evidence suggests that vitamin B12 400 mcg, folic acid 1 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg daily can decrease the rate of restenosis in patients treated with balloon angioplasty (8009, 9412, 34540). However, this combination does not seem to be as effective for reducing restenosis in patients after coronary stenting (8009). An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mg, pyridoxine 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after bare metal coronary stenting also does not seem to reduce restenosis and might actually increase restenosis (12150, 12151, 34540). Due to the lack of evidence of benefit and potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151). It is unclear if any effects are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAnxiety. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for anxiety and panic attacks, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for these uses.\nAsthma. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition.\nAtherosclerosis. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with intermediate risk for coronary heart disease shows that taking vitamin B12 100 mcg, aged garlic extract 250 mg, folic acid 300 mcg, vitamin B6 12.5 mg, and L-arginine 100 mg daily for 12 months reduces coronary artery calcium progression when compared with placebo (88385). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical vitamin B12 reduces the severity of eczema.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific topical vitamin B12 0.07% cream (Regividerm) twice daily reduces the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis when compared with placebo (15765).\nless\nAttention. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for improving attention and focus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this use.\nCancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces overall cancer risk when used in combination with other B vitamins.\nAn ancillary clinical study in middle-aged and elderly adults with cardiovascular disease shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 0.02 mg, folic acid 0.56 mg, and vitamin B6 3 mg, with or without eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 400 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 200 mg, for a median of 4.7 years does not reduce the risk of cancer when compared with placebo (90666). An additional secondary analysis of clinical research in patients recovering from stroke or transient ischemic attack shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg, folic acid 2 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg daily for around 3.4 years does not reduce the risk of cancer when compared with placebo (90378). The validity of these findings is limited because the studies were not designed nor adequately powered to test for cancer risk.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral vitamin B12, taken along with other B vitamins, does not seem to improve secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction in patients with CVD. However, it might slightly reduce the risk of stroke.\nOverall evidence from clinical research and meta-analyses shows that taking vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid and/or vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk for secondary death or myocardial infarction in patients with or at risk for CVD (11387, 13482, 34540, 50423, 83050, 90379, 97619). In fact, some research suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 for secondary prevention increases the risk of CVD by 20% despite lowering homocysteine levels by 30% (13482). However, other research shows that taking vitamin B12 in combination with other B vitamins modestly reduces the risk of stroke, although results are conflicting (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 96150, 96165, 97619, 107136). It is unclear which specific combination of B vitamins, if any, might be optimal for reducing stroke risk and which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nIn 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces cervical cancer risk.\nSome epidemiological evidence has found that increasing vitamin B12 intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with folic acid, thiamine, and riboflavin, might decrease the risk of precancerous cervical lesions (11074). Also, an analysis of two case control studies has found that increased intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% reduced odds of cervical cancer (34609).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients receiving chemotherapy shows that a combination of B vitamins that includes vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 1000 mcg, taken daily starting one week prior to treatment and finishing 12 weeks after treatment is completed, does not prevent peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo (96173).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for child development.\nPopulation research has found that daily dietary intake of less than 2.26 mcg vitamin B12 in the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of poorer outcomes in the offspring for some measures of speech and mathematics ability, including vocabulary at 24 months, combining words at 38 months, speech intelligibility at 6 years, and math comprehension between ages 8-11 years, when compared with dietary intakes of at least 2.26 mcg daily. There was no association between prenatal vitamin B12 intake and reading or spelling abilities, vocabulary at other ages, or full-scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) at ages 8 or 15 (107143). Furthermore, a very large clinical study in infants of pregnant adults, 71% of whom were deficient in vitamin B12 at baseline, shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily starting in early pregnancy (<15 weeks gestation) until 6 months postpartum does not improve neurodevelopment as measured by language, motor, socioemotional, or cognitive scores at 12 months old and may worsen early motor performance at 8-12 weeks when compared with placebo. However, the negative effects on motor performance resolved by 6 and 12 months of age (112431).\nless\nChild growth. Oral vitamin B12 taken by pregnant adults does not seem to be beneficial for infant growth.\nA very large clinical study in infants of pregnant adults, 71% of whom were deficient in vitamin B12 at baseline, shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily starting in early pregnancy (<15 weeks gestation) until 6 months postpartum does not improve the infant's linear growth, length, or weight at 12 months of age (112431).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces the risk of COPD.\nClinical research in patients with COPD shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves endurance on the cycle ergometer, but does not improve oxygen consumption, when compared with placebo (96172).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in healthy, middle-aged adults shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin B12, other B vitamins, bacopa, and gingko biloba twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of memory, attention, cognition, mood, or stress reactivity when compared with placebo (111334).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces colorectal cancer risk.\nSome epidemiological evidence has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (90383). However, preliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin B12 1 mg, folic acid 2.5 mg, and vitamin B6 50 mg daily for up to 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma in females at high risk for cardiovascular disease (90389). Furthermore, a secondary analysis of clinical research in elderly patients suggests that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg and folic acid 400 mcg daily for 2 years might increase the risk of colorectal cancer when compared with placebo (90393).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for patients with COVID-19.\nA small observational study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has found that higher plasma vitamin B12 levels may be associated with an increased risk of transfer to intensive care or death than lower plasma levels. However, when multivariate regression was conducted, only patient age was associated with worsened outcomes. Additionally, the total study population was small, with only nine of 49 patients experiencing the worsened outcomes (107138).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces the risk of developing dementia.\nA large cohort of Danish adults has found that vitamin B12 levels or intake does not seem to impact the risk of developing Alzheimer disease or other dementias (104922). However, vitamin B12 might be beneficial in specific patient populations. A small observational study in patients with Parkinson disease has found that higher vitamin B12 levels (648.5 ng/L) are associated with a lower risk of developing dementia when compared with lower vitamin B12 levels (452 ng/L) (103975). It is not yet known if supplementation with vitamin B12 reduces the risk for dementia in these patients.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing depression risk.\nA meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 14% reduced risk of depression. However, in a sub-analysis, this association was not significant in males (107133). In contrast, one epidemiological study in older males included in the analysis has found that daily dietary intake of at least 4.79 mcg vitamin B12 is linked with a 58% lower risk of depression when compared with daily intake of less than 3.16 mcg. In this study, this inverse association was not observed in females (96168). Other observational research has found that low-normal serum vitamin B12 levels are associated with a 3.8 times increased risk for depression during pregnancy when compared with normal vitamin B12 levels (102384). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12 through the diet or supplements reduces the risk for depression or is beneficial for treating symptoms of depression in any population. However, a meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly populations shows that supplementation with vitamin B12 100-1000 mcg daily, usually in combination with folic acid 400-2000 mcg daily, does not reduce symptoms of depression. Most individuals in these studies were not specifically diagnosed with depression (107140).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 improves glycemic indices or prevents loss of skeletal muscle in patients with diabetes.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetes in India who are stabilized on metformin and/or a sulfonylurea shows that taking vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 500 mcg with or without folic acid 5 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) by 1.3% to 1.5%, compared with a 0.3% increase with placebo (104917). This study is limited due its small sample size and lack of blinding. In elderly adults with type 2 diabetes, population research has found a lower dietary intake of vitamin B12 (average of 11.2 mcg daily) in individuals with a loss of skeletal muscle mass of at least 1.2%, compared with an average intake of 13.4 mcg daily in those with a skeletal muscle mass loss of less than 1.2%. However, further analysis determined that any relationship between vitamin B12 intake and loss of skeletal muscle mass was only significant in individuals with insufficient energy intake overall (107151).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin B12 may modestly improve pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy show that taking vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 1-1.5 mg for 4-12 months modestly improves pain when compared with baseline or placebo (82841, 104923). Some research also shows that vitamin B12 may be beneficial in combination with other ingredients. Studies have evaluated products containing vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin or cyanocobalamin), benfotiamine, and vitamin B6 daily for 9-12 weeks (82931, 82939); and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 2 mg, folic acid (L-methylfolate) 3 mg, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) 35 mg (Metanx; Pamlab) daily for 24 weeks (90375).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing diarrhea in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-30 months from low- and middle-income countries shows that taking vitamin B12 at twice the recommended dietary allowance, with or without folic acid, does not reduce the risk for diarrhea when compared with placebo (90391).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial for improving well-being in those with fatigue or tiredness.\nA small crossover trial in patients complaining of tiredness or fatigue shows that receiving intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 5 mg twice weekly for 2 weeks seems to improve general well-being and happiness, and has a trend toward improving fatigue, when compared with placebo (10127). The validity of this study is limited by a large drop-out rate and unstandardized outcome measures.\nless\nHearing loss. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with adenosine triphosphate; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational study in adults with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss has found that taking vitamin B12 1.5 mg with adenosine triphosphate 300 mg daily for 8-16 weeks is associated with modestly reduced hearing loss at 4-6 months after starting treatment when compared with taking the combination for less than 8 weeks (104924). This finding is limited due to its observational nature and lack of a control group.\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial for sustaining viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 5000 mcg every 4 weeks along with standard care improves sustained viral response when compared with standard of care alone (90386).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing triglyceride levels.\nSome evidence shows that taking vitamin B12 7.5 mcg with fish oil 5 grams might be superior to fish oil alone when used daily to reduce total serum cholesterol and triglycerides. This suggests vitamin B12 might have an independent effect in lowering serum cholesterol and triglycerides, but further investigation is needed to confirm this effect (8694).\nless\nHypotension. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for treating hypotension.\nA meta-analysis of 3 observational studies in patients hospitalized with hypotension secondary to cardiac surgery vasoplegia suggests that administration of intravenous vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) is associated with an 8 mmHg higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour but no change in vasopressor dosage at 1 hour or mortality rate when compared with methylene blue (112264). The validity of these findings is limited by the inclusion of only retrospective studies.\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if taking oral vitamin B12 during pregnancy is beneficial for improving infant development. Giving oral vitamin B12 to infants does not seem to be beneficial.\nClinical research shows that supplementation with vitamin B12 50 mcg daily from less than 14 weeks gestation until 6 weeks postpartum does not improve cognitive development in infants by 9 months of age when compared with placebo (96174). When these children were evaluated at 30 months of age, a very small benefit of vitamin B12 on expressive language was identified; however, there was no effect on cognition, receptive language, fine motor skills, or gross motor skills (100169). It is unknown whether a longer duration of postpartum supplementation or supplementation in specific populations might be beneficial.\n\nVitamin B12 supplementation in infants has also been evaluated. A large clinical trial in marginally stunted Nepalese infants aged 6-11 months shows that giving vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 2 mcg daily for 12 months reduces homocysteine levels, but does not improve motor or cognitive development, when compared with placebo (104926).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition.\nLung cancer. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThe association between vitamin B12 and lung cancer is unclear. Some population research found no relationship between blood levels of vitamin B12 and lung cancer (9454). However, other observational research involving over 5,000 case-control pairs found that higher vitamin B12 levels are linked with an increased risk for lung cancer (102383). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of lung cancer.\nless\nMale infertility. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA retrospective study in adult males with idiopathic and varicocele-related infertility suggests that taking a combination product containing vitamin B12 1.5 mcg, L-carnitine, acetyl L-carnitine, citric acid, selenium, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, zinc, and folic acid (Proxeed Plus) twice daily for 6 months is associated with improvements in ejaculate volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility in patients with idiopathic infertility when compared to baseline. However, improvement in sperm morphology was lacking. Furthermore, patients with more severe varicocele seem to benefit most, especially with regard to progressive motility (111296). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of comparator group. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMastalgia. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mastalgia shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 as methylcobalamin 100 mg, gamma-linolenic acid, and vitamin C daily for 12 weeks does not improve the proportion of patients with minimal or no pain when compared with placebo (111059).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily for 12 weeks reduces serum levels of homocysteine but has no effect on serum aminotransferases, measures of steatosis, fibrosis scores, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, measures of insulin resistance, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (111555).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nMost population research has found that increased intake of vitamin B12, as a supplement or in the diet, is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (9327, 104927). However, a small, retrospective population study in which smoking and non-smoking adults recalled past eating habits found that increased dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 33% reduction in pancreatic cancer risk (97976). These conflicting findings may be related to study methodology, as well as the age, gender, or smoking status of the included patients.\nless\nPeriodontitis. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for periodontitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition.\nPeripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing vitamin B12 3 mcg, folic acid 400 mcg, and uridine monophosphate 50 mg (Keltican) daily for 60 days reduces pain by 44% and decreases analgesic use by over 75% when compared to baseline in patients with peripheral neuropathy, including those with lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy, sciatic pain, and cervical radiculopathy (90384). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefits are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPsoriasis. Topical vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a specific cream containing vitamin B12 and avocado oil (Regividerm, Regeneratio Pharma AG) reduces symptoms of psoriasis as effectively as calcipotriol ointment (Psorcutan) after 12 weeks of therapy. The vitamin B12 combination cream also causes less irritation than calcipotriol (14909). It is unclear if the benefits are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. A small study suggests that oral vitamin B12 does not reduce the rate of respiratory tract infections in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-30 months from low-and middle-income countries suggests that taking vitamin B12 at twice the recommended dietary allowance with or without folic acid does not reduce the risk for lower respiratory tract infections when compared with placebo (90391).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 400 mcg and folic acid 2 mg daily for 16 weeks improves negative symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia who have persistent symptoms and a specific genetic variant of the folate transporter gene FOLHI. This variant normally results in reduced folate absorption. However, in patients without this genetic variant, folate is not beneficial with respect to negative symptom improvement (90387).\nless\nSickle cell disease. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other B vitamins; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin B12 4.2-6 mcg, folic acid 700 mcg, and vitamin B6 4.2-6 mg daily might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is unknown if this will reduce the risk of endothelial damage in these patients (9324).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12, either alone or with other B vitamins, is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that people with a higher intake of vitamin B12 from dietary sources do not have a reduced risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (14316). A number of clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or impaired kidney function (11387, 13482, 50420, 50423, 83050, 90379, 90380, 96150). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials including over 44,000 patients shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo in patients at risk or with a history of CVD (97619). This meta-analysis differed from some of the earlier analyses due to the inclusion of several additional clinical trials. Also, a meta-analysis in adults with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo (107136).\n\nIn 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368). Unfortunately, even after the publication of higher quality research, it is still unclear which specific combination of B vitamins is optimal and which patients are most likely to benefit. One network meta-analysis suggests that a combination of folic acid and vitamin B6 lowers the risk of stroke more effectively than B vitamin mixtures that include vitamin B12 (96165). However, this analysis is limited because it didn't account for dosing. Another meta-analysis suggests that exposure to low, but not high, amounts of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) seems to reduce stroke risk (96150).\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial in patients with tinnitus.\nA small clinical study shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 2500 mcg weekly for 6 weeks reduces tinnitus severity by 22% when compared to baseline in patients with chronic tinnitus and vitamin B12 deficiency, but not in patients with normal levels of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 does not improve pitch or volume in either group of patients (96170). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for preventing VTE.\nEpidemiological research has found that low levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk for VTE. However, clinical trials evaluating the use of B vitamins for prevention of VTE have shown conflicting results (90398).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin B12 for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B12 are: 18 years and older, 2.4 mcg; pregnancy, 2.6 mcg; lactation, 2.8 mcg.\n\nSince 10% to 30% of older adults do not absorb food-bound vitamin B12 efficiently, those over 50 years of age are advised to meet the RDA by eating foods fortified with vitamin B12 or by taking a vitamin B12 supplement. 25-100 mcg daily has been taken to maintain vitamin B12 levels in older people. A healthcare professional should be consulted for use for other indications (6243). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake lasting longer than two weeks can decrease vitamin B12 absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (15).\nAll other ROAs:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) have not been established for all pediatric age groups; therefore, adequate intake (AI) levels have been used instead. The RDAs or AI levels of vitamin B12 by age are: 0-6 months, 0.4 mcg (AI); 7-12 months, 0.5 mcg (AI); 1-3 years, 0.9 mcg; 4-8 years, 1.2 mcg; 9-13 years, 1.8 mcg (6243).\n\nSee Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThe term \"vitamin B12\" refers to any of the cobalamins, a group of chemically-related molecules that all have a cobalt-containing center. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12 in the human body, but it is rarely used in supplements because it is light sensitive (90948). Cyanocobalamin is the most common form of vitamin B12 used in supplements in the United States (74154). This form of vitamin B12 must be metabolized before becoming active (90948). In one branded product (Eligen B12), cyanocobalamin has been formulated with salcaprozate sodium (SNAC) to increase oral absorption (103973). Hydroxocobalamin is another form of vitamin B12 that is commonly used in some parts of Europe (90948). When administered intramuscularly, hydroxocobalamin is retained in the body for longer than cyanocobalamin (90949).",

            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nFOLIC ACID\nWhen taken in large doses, folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency.\nFolic acid can produce hematologic improvement in megaloblastic anemia, which may allow potentially irreversible neurological damage to progress in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 status should be determined before folic acid is given as monotherapy (2677, 3092, 5646, 9411, 20504, 20505).\nless\nPOTASSIUM\nPotassium might contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in some people with other risk factors, but routine supplements aren't necessary.\nPotassium supplements can reduce absorption of vitamin B12 in some people (4511, 4512). This might be due to acidification of the ileal contents, which reduces the activity of intrinsic factor (4512). This effect has been reported with potassium chloride and, to a lesser extent, with potassium citrate (10501).\nless\nVITAMIN C\nTheoretically, vitamin C supplements might reduce vitamin B12 levels.\nSome research suggests that vitamin C supplements can destroy dietary vitamin B12, resulting in lower blood levels of vitamin B12 in humans (20507, 20509). However, other components of food, such as iron and nitrates, might counteract this effect (9511, 20508). It is not clear whether this interaction is clinically significant, and it can likely be avoided if vitamin C supplements are taken at least 2 hours after meals.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANGIOPLASTY\nThere is some concern that B vitamins might increase the rate of restenosis after bare metal stent placement. An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mg, vitamin B6 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after coronary stenting might actually increase restenosis rates (12150). Due to the potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151).\nless\nCOBALAMIN OR COBALT HYPERSENSITIVITY\nVitamin B12 contains cobalamin and cobalt and might cause allergic reactions in those with hypersensitivity to these compounds (15).\nless",

A case of undetectable anti-Xa level has been reported in a patient treated with hydroxocobalamin for catecholamine-resistant shock followed by treatment with heparin. Hydroxocobalamin may interfere with chromogenic anti-Xa assays levels regardless of heparin dosage adjustments, leading to a lack of reliability in monitoring and adjusting heparin infusion rates. This could cause excessive bleeding or clotting (112282).\nless\nCARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN\nHydroxocobalamin has a distinct red color and might cause falsely lowered readings in colorimetric lab tests. Cases of falsely lowered carboxyhemoglobin levels have been reported in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin for carbon monoxide poisoning (90382). This lab test interaction may lead to inaccurate diagnoses or inappropriate therapy in some patients.\nless\nDIALYSIS BLOOD LEAK DETECTOR\nHydroxocobalamin has a distinct red color and causes chromaturia which might trigger a false-positive blood leak during dialysis. Cases of hydroxocobalamin permeating dialysis membranes, discoloring dialysate, and then triggering false-positive blood leak detection have been reported. When blood leaks are detected, dialysis may automatically be stopped. This could cause serious injury or death in patients requiring dialysis (90368, 90376, 90390, 112264).\nless\nINTRINSIC FACTOR\nVitamin B12 can cause a false-positive test result for intrinsic factor antibodies (15).\nless",
            "Nutrient Depletions": "AMINOSALICYLIC ACID\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nAminosalicylic acid might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and increase the risk of deficiency.\nAminosalicylic acid can reduce oral vitamin B12 absorption, possibly by as much as 55%, as part of a general malabsorption syndrome (9574). Megaloblastic changes and occasional cases of symptomatic anemia have occurred, usually after doses of 8-12 grams daily for several months (4558, 9395, 9397). Monitor vitamin B12 levels in people taking aminosalicylic acid for more than one month. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nANTIBIOTIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nAntibiotics might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12, but this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nDisruption of the normal gastrointestinal (GI) flora may interrupt enterohepatic recirculation of vitamin B12 and increase fecal excretion (4436). Vitamin B12 is also synthesized by the GI flora, but mainly in the colon where absorption is poor. The majority of bacterially-synthesized vitamin B12 is therefore excreted in the feces and does not significantly contribute to the body's store of vitamin B12 (4437, 9502). The effects of antibiotics on gastrointestinal bacteria are unlikely to have clinically significant effects on vitamin B12 levels. In people with bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) can actually improve vitamin B12 status. An increased bacterial load can bind significant amounts of vitamin B12 in the gut, preventing its absorption (4437, 9502).\nless\nASPIRIN\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nAspirin might reduce levels of vitamin B12 and increase the risk of deficiency.\nClinical research suggests that using aspirin is associated with a higher prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency when compared with nonusers (20394). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nBILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nBile acid sequestrants might reduce vitamin B12 absorption, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nThese resins can decrease gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of vitamin B12 by binding intrinsic factor and vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complexes (10542, 10543). However, absorption isn't completely prevented (10542). It's unlikely that this interaction will deplete body stores of vitamin B12 unless there are other factors contributing to deficiency. In a group of children treated with cholestyramine for up to 2.5 years, there was no change in serum vitamin B12 levels (4455). Routine supplements aren't necessary.\nless\nCARBAMAZEPINE (TEGRETOL)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCarbamazepine, especially when taken long-term, might reduce vitamin B12 absorption and increase the risk of deficiency.\nA small observational study in children started on carbamazepine monotherapy and continued for 3 months has found marked reductions in folate and vitamin B12 blood levels. This might increase the risk of megaloblastic anemia (103984). Encourage patients to maintain adequate dietary vitamin B12 intake, and check folate and vitamin B12 status if symptoms of anemia develop. If considering alternatives, oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), an analog to carbamazepine, does not seem to produce clinically significant reductions in vitamin B12 levels (103985). Additionally, levetiracetam (Keppra) and valproate have not been associated with reduced vitamin B12 levels (103986, 103987, 104946). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nCOLCHICINE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nColchicine might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and increase the risk of deficiency.\nColchicine in doses of 1.9-3.9 mg daily can disrupt normal intestinal mucosal function, leading to malabsorption of several nutrients, including vitamin B12 (4543, 4544, 4545). Lower doses don't seem to have a significant effect on vitamin B12 absorption after 3 years of colchicine therapy (5921). The significance of this interaction isn't clear. Monitor vitamin B12 levels in people taking large doses of colchicine for prolonged periods. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nOral contraceptives might reduce levels of vitamin B12; however, research is conflicting.\nThe data regarding the effects of oral contraceptives on vitamin B12 serum levels are conflicting. Some studies have found reduced serum levels in oral contraceptive users (4547, 9371, 9373, 9505), but others have found no effect despite use of oral contraceptives for up to 6 months (4498, 7843, 9372). When reduced serum levels are detected, vitamin B12 absorption, urinary excretion, tissue and erythrocyte levels, methylmalonic acid levels, and homocysteine are normal (9371, 9373, 9505, 10123). When oral contraceptive use is stopped, normalization of vitamin B12 levels usually occurs (10123). It's suggested that oral contraceptives reduce production of transcobalamin I, the protein which transports vitamin B12 in the blood (4547, 9373, 9505). Thus, more of the vitamin is available for tissue uptake and serum levels may be reduced. Vitamin B12 supplements don't seem to increase serum levels of vitamin B12 (9373). Lower vitamin B12 serum levels seen with oral contraceptives probably aren't clinically significant.\nless\nH2-BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nH2-blockers might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and increase the risk of deficiency.\nReduced secretion of gastric acid and pepsin produced by H2-blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary), but not supplemental, vitamin B12 (4539, 4540, 4541, 9513, 9514, 9528). This is because gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption (4541, 9513, 9514, 9528). Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2-blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more) or dietary vitamin B12 is low (4539, 9513, 9514, 18966). The odds of developing vitamin B12 deficiency are 25% higher in individuals taking H2-blockers for 2 years or more compared to non-users. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also more likely with prolonged, high-dose H2-blocker therapy than with prolonged, low-dose therapy (18966) and in people rendered achlorhydric (4483), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2-blockers. Vitamin B12 deficiency is expected to diminish upon discontinuation of H2-blocker therapy (18966). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nMETFORMIN (Glucophage)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nMetformin reduces vitamin B12 levels in a dose and duration-dependent manner, which might result in deficiency.\nMetformin might interfere with intrinsic factor secretion or uptake, affect bowel motility, or cause bacterial overgrowth, resulting in vitamin B12 malabsorption and hyperhomocysteinemia (32, 4490, 7839, 9521, 102382, 107149, 111552). There are also rare reports of megaloblastic anemia in people who have taken metformin for 5 years or more (9520, 9521, 9522). Reduced absorption occurs in up to 30% of people taking metformin chronically and appears to be a dose-dependent effect (4490, 9520, 9521, 9523, 102382, 111552). However, clinically significant deficiency isn't likely to develop if dietary intake of vitamin B12 is adequate, including the intake of a multivitamin or vitamin B12 supplement (8834, 9521, 9523, 102382). The risk of deficiency is higher in those taking a higher metformin dose for 3 years or more and also in older people and vegetarians (15134). Deficiency can be corrected with vitamin B12 supplements even if metformin is continued (9520, 9522). Monitor for signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Advise people taking metformin chronically to include adequate amounts of vitamin B12 in the diet and to have serum vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels checked annually. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nNEOMYCIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nNeomycin, when taken in typical doses and for a typical duration, is unlikely to reduce levels of vitamin B12.\nAbsorption of vitamin B12 can be reduced by neomycin, but prolonged use of large doses is needed to induce pernicious anemia (3046, 8434). Supplements aren't needed with normal doses. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nNITROUS OXIDE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nNitrous oxide might inactivate vitamin B12 and produce symptoms of deficiency.\nNitrous oxide inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy, and encephalopathy, can occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency. Symptoms are treated with high doses of vitamin B12, but recovery can be slow and incomplete. People with normal vitamin B12 levels have sufficient vitamin B12 stores to make the effects of nitrous oxide insignificant, unless exposure is repeated and prolonged (nitrous oxide abuse) (9527, 9532). In people with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency, check vitamin B12 levels prior to using nitrous oxide anesthesia.\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPhenobarbital, especially when taken long-term, might reduce vitamin B12 absorption and increase the risk of deficiency.\nIn one case report, a 23-year-old male with epilepsy who was taking phenytoin with phenobarbital for two years presented with megaloblastic anemia due to severe decreases in vitamin B12 and folate levels (10503). Theoretically, phenytoin and/or phenobarbital may have interfered with vitamin B12 absorption. Encourage patients to maintain adequate dietary vitamin B12 intake, and check folate and vitamin B12 status if symptoms of anemia develop. If considering alternatives, neither oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), levetiracetam (Keppra), nor valproate have been associated with reduced vitamin B12 levels (103985, 103986, 103987, 104946). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (DILANTIN)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPhenytoin, especially with chronic use, might reduce vitamin B12 absorption and increase the risk of deficiency.\nPopulation research has found that taking phenytoin for over two years is associated with a reduction in vitamin B12 levels and an approximately 6-fold increase in risk for vitamin B12 deficiency when compared with taking phenytoin for less than one year (107146). In one case report, a 23-year-old male with epilepsy who was taking phenytoin with phenobarbital for two years presented with megaloblastic anemia due to severe decreases in vitamin B12 and folate levels (10503). Encourage patients who are taking phenytoin long-term to maintain adequate dietary vitamin B12 intake, and check folate and vitamin B12 status if symptoms of anemia develop. If considering alternatives, neither oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), levetiracetam (Keppra), nor valproate have been associated with reduced vitamin B12 levels (103985, 103986, 103987, 104946). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nPPIs might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12, particularly with prolonged use.\nThe reduced secretion of gastric acid and pepsin produced by PPIs can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary), but not supplemental, vitamin B12 (4483, 4484, 4485, 4486, 9513, 9528). This is because gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption (4484, 4486, 9513, 9528, 11153). Reduced vitamin B12 levels may be more common with PPIs than with H2-blockers, because they are more likely to produce achlorhydria (4483, 4486). However, PPI therapy is unlikely to cause clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (111553). Some evidence suggests that vitamin B12 deficiency is more likely in the case of prolonged PPI therapy (2 years or more) or insufficient dietary vitamin B12 intake (4483, 4484, 9513, 18966). The odds of developing vitamin B12 deficiency are 65% higher in individuals taking PPIs for 2 years or more when compared with non-users. Also, vitamin B12 deficiency is more likely with prolonged, high-dose PPI therapy than with prolonged, low-dose therapy. Vitamin B12 deficiency is expected to diminish upon discontinuation of PPI therapy (18966). The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) does not recommend increased intake of vitamin B12 or routine monitoring of serum vitamin B12 levels for patients who are taking PPIs and have no other risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency (107368). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless\nZIDOVUDINE (Retrovir)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nZidovudine might modestly reduce the absorption of vitamin B12.\nReduced serum vitamin B12 levels may occur when zidovudine therapy is started (30, 10531, 111551). This adds to other factors that cause low vitamin B12 levels in people with HIV, and might contribute to the hematological toxicity associated with zidovudine (10531, 10532, 111551). Some data suggest vitamin B12 supplements aren't helpful for people taking zidovudine (10532, 10533). However, one case report shows that zidovudine-associated refractory macrocytic anemia resolved within 3 months of discontinuing zidovudine and receiving parenteral vitamin B12 (111551). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B12, see our chart.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with vitamin B12.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nVitamin B12 is primarily absorbed (60%) by binding with intrinsic factor to be actively transported in the terminal ileum. In addition to active absorption, it is estimated that about 1.2% of vitamin B12 is absorbed by passive diffusion. Dietary vitamin B12 is cleaved from proteins at normal gastric pH. Conditions involving increased gastric pH such as atrophic gastritis, use of acid-suppressing drugs, or partial gastrectomy, reduce vitamin B12 absorption. Loss of intrinsic factor in pernicious anemia and total gastrectomy also reduce absorption. Intramuscular administration is often used to avoid these absorption problems. More recently, high oral doses of vitamin B12 (300 to 1000 mcg) have been used to capitalize on absorption by passive diffusion and treat pernicious anemia and malabsorption from food (2909, 9518, 103972). A fasting state seems to increase vitamin B12 absorption when compared with a postprandial state, and a maximum concentration seems to occur about three hours after oral supplementation (82814).\n\nCertain oral vitamin B12 formulations can increase bioavailability. In one branded product (Eligen B12), cyanocobalamin formulated with salcaprozate sodium (SNAC) has about a 2-fold greater absolute absorption when compared with cyanocobalamin alone (103973).\nExcretion\nOrally, vitamin B12 as cyanocobalamin and cyanocobalamin-SNAC has a half-life of about 25-30 hours. Intravenously, vitamin B12 as cyanocobalamin has a half-life of about 15 hours (103973).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products (74154). The term vitamin B12 refers to all cobalamins that are active as coenzymes in humans, including dibencozide (adenosylcobalamin), methylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin (5133). Vitamin B12 is required for nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction, normal growth, and normal erythropoiesis. The synthetic forms of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin, can be converted to coenzyme B12, which is essential for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate, and the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine (15, 9320). Vitamin B12 is involved in maintaining sulfhydryl groups in the reduced form required by enzymes involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. Vitamin B12 is essential for folate utilization, and its absence results in a functional folate deficiency (15).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can take months to years to become symptomatic due to large body stores. Normal serum vitamin B12 levels range between 200-900 pg/mL. Serum concentrations less than 200 pg/mL indicate deficiency, and concentrations less than 100 pg/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia or neurologic damage (15). Vitamin B12 deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, gastrointestinal lesions, and neurologic damage, beginning with an inability to produce myelin and progressing to degeneration of the axon and nerve head (15). Neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can include neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression (6357), paresthesias, ataxia, memory loss, weakness, and personality and mood changes without anemia (1484, 1485, 3235, 5646). Some neurologic symptoms and elevated homocysteine levels can occur without any signs of B12 deficiency anemia (1484, 1485, 3235). Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with impaired cognitive performance in adolescents (aged 10-16 years) who have been fed a strict vegetarian diet from infancy to 6 years of age. Consequences of low vitamin B12 intake during childhood and its effect on cognitive functioning in adulthood are unknown (10125). Elevated methylmalonate or methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels occur early in vitamin B12 deficiency, and may precede other symptoms (1484, 1485, 5646). In combination with homocysteine levels, MMA levels can be used to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency (5646).\n\nThe risk for vitamin B12 deficiency is higher with increased age, male gender, and in people of Caucasian and Latin American descent. Deficiency in vitamin B12 results from insufficient intake, malabsorption from food, and other medical conditions (1484, 1485). However, body stores of vitamin B12 are large, and it is widely available in food. Vitamin B12 deficiency is almost always caused by a disorder of absorption (9518).\n\nDeficiency of vitamin B12 can be masked by folic acid, particularly in large doses. Folate will improve vitamin B12 associated anemia, but it will allow the neurologic abnormalities to progress. There is some concern that food fortified with folic acid can cause under-recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the elderly (5646).\nAnticancer effects\nVitamin B12 is believed to possess anticancer properties (82890), and supplementation of vitamin B12 may have a role in preventing cervical cancer (50130, 34609). However, although some epidemiological research disagrees (9454), most research has found that elevated plasma levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancers and solid tumors (50411, 102383, 107743). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of cancer. It is possible that having cancer increases the risk of vitamin B12 elevation. However, one observational study has found that the highest quintile of dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% increased incidence of developing esophageal cancer when compared with the lowest quintile in never drinkers, but not drinkers (107147). Also, human research suggests that elevated serum vitamin B12 levels associated with tumor markers may indicate poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (82887).\nCardiovascular effects\nVitamin B12 is required in one of the pathways for homocysteine metabolism. Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and the methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 as a cofactor (9407, 9409). Some evidence suggests elevated homocysteine levels might cause vascular endothelial cell damage, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide activity, increased oxidation and arterial deposition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased platelet adhesiveness, and activation of the clotting cascade (2147, 9403, 9408). Vitamin B12 supplements have a small additive effect to folic acid in lowering fasting homocysteine levels, but probably only in people with vitamin B12 deficiency (2147, 50314, 50222, 50014, 50164). Elevated homocysteine concentrations are possibly associated with other conditions such as developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), decreased cognitive function, impaired memory, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia (5646, 9330, 9331).\nHepatic effects\nIn vitro research shows that vitamin B12 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication. Additionally, some liver diseases appear to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to impaired storage of vitamin B12 in the liver. Theoretically, supplementation with vitamin B12 may restore liver stores of vitamin B12 and improve virological response in patients with hepatitis. This has been demonstrated in preliminary clinical research (90386).\nNeurological effects\nLow vitamin B12 levels are possibly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (6082). Some researchers think that vitamin B12 supplements could help symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome by correcting red blood cell abnormalities and improving oxygen delivery to tissues (6082). The methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 might also influence melatonin levels. Methylcobalamin seems to improve alertness and reduce sleep time in humans with normal sleep patterns, possibly due to effects on melatonin (1349). Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients shows that taking B vitamins, including vitamin B12, reduces brain atrophy in the areas of the brain most affected by Alzheimer disease. This suggests that taking vitamin B12 along with other B vitamins might prevent or delay the progression to Alzheimer disease in some patients (90374). Additional evidence suggests that supplementation of B vitamins, including vitamin B12, may help prevent dementia by lowering homocysteine levels (50222, 50277). Some research shows that elevated serum homocysteine and low folate and vitamin B12 levels may be associated with poor cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia (82884).\nOtic effects\nLow vitamin B12 levels have been associated with hearing loss in elderly women (1482).\nVoice effects\nA small study in active adult singers shows that receiving an intramuscular injection of\n\nvitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 1 mg tends to improve ease of singing and voice handicap, and reduce fatigue 3 days after the shot. However, the benefit did not reach statistical nor clinical significance when compared with baseline or placebo (104925)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin B6 is a member of the vitamin B family. It is present in many foods including cereal grains, legumes, vegetables, liver, meat, and eggs (15). Pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine are all forms of vitamin B6 and are considered to be equivalent in the human body (93048). Dietary supplements containing vitamin B6 frequently also contain other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations (3022).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in doses that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 100 mg daily in the form of pyridoxine for adults (15, 6243). ...when used parenterally and appropriately. Injectable vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is an FDA-approved prescription product (15).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in doses of 101-200 mg daily (6243, 8558).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses at or above 500 mg daily. High doses, especially those exceeding 1000 mg daily or total doses of 1000 grams or more, pose the most risk. However, neuropathy can occur with lower daily or total doses (6243, 8195). ...when used intramuscularly in high doses and frequency due to potential for rhabdomyolysis (90795).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in doses that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine 30 mg daily for children aged 1-3 years, 40 mg daily for 4-8 years, 60 mg daily for 9-13 years, and 80 mg daily for 14-18 years (6243).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts exceeding the recommended dietary allowance (5049, 8579, 107124, 107125, 107135).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses, long-term (6243).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A special sustained-release product providing vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 75 mg daily is FDA-approved for use in pregnancy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is also considered a first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (111601). However, it should not be used long-term or without medical supervision and close monitoring. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) refers to vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine and is 80 mg daily for those aged 14-18 years and 100 mg daily for 19 years and older (6243).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. There is some concern that high-dose maternal vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can cause neonatal seizures (4609, 6397, 8197).\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in doses not exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine 80 mg daily for those aged 14-18 years and 100 mg daily for those 19 years and older. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) in lactating women is 2 mg daily (6243). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of vitamin B6 when used in higher doses in breast-feeding women.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally or by injection, vitamin B6 is well tolerated in doses less than 100 mg daily.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally or by injection: Abdominal pain, allergic reactions, headache, heartburn, loss of appetite, nausea, somnolence, vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally or by injection: Sensory neuropathy (high doses).\nDermatologic\nOrally, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) has been linked to reports of skin and other allergic reactions and photosensitivity (8195, 9479, 90375). High-dose vitamin B6 (80 mg daily as pyridoxine) and vitamin B12 (20 mcg daily) have been associated with cases of rosacea fulminans characterized by intense erythema with nodules, papules, and pustules. Symptoms may persist for up to 4 months after the supplement is stopped, and may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids and topical therapy (10998).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally or by injection, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can cause nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, mild diarrhea, and loss of appetite (8195, 9479, 16306, 83064, 83103, 107124, 107127, 107135). In a clinical trial, one patient experienced infectious gastroenteritis that was deemed possibly related to taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) orally up to 20 mg/kg daily (90796). One small case-control study has raised concern that long-term dietary vitamin B6 intake in amounts ranging from 3.56-6.59 mg daily can increase the risk of ulcerative colitis (3350).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally or by injection, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can cause decreased serum folic acid concentrations (8195, 9479). One case of persistent bleeding of unknown origin has been reported in a clinical trial for a patient who used vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 100 mg twice daily on days 16 to 35 of the menstrual cycle (83103). It is unclear if this effect was due to vitamin B6 intake.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally or by injection, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can cause breast soreness or enlargement (8195).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally or by injection, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can cause headache, paresthesia, and somnolence (8195, 9479, 16306). Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can also cause sensory neuropathy, which is related to daily dose and duration of intake. Doses exceeding 1000 mg daily or total doses of 1000 grams or more pose the most risk, although neuropathy can occur with lower daily or total doses as well (8195). The mechanism of the neurotoxicity is unknown, but is thought to occur when the liver's capacity to phosphorylate pyridoxine via the active coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate is exceeded (8204). Some researchers recommend taking vitamin B6 as pyridoxal phosphate to avoid pyridoxine neuropathy, but its safety is unknown (8204). Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) neuropathy is characterized by numbness and impairment of the sense of position and vibration of the distal limbs, and a gradual progressive sensory ataxia (8196, 10439). The syndrome is usually reversible with discontinuation of pyridoxine at the first appearance of neurologic symptoms. Residual symptoms have been reported in patients taking more than 2 grams daily for extended periods (8195, 8196). Daily doses of 100 mg or less are unlikely to cause these problems (3094).\nless\nOncologic\nIn females, population research has found that a median intake of vitamin B6 1.63 mg daily is associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of rectal cancer when compared with a median intake of 1.05 mg daily (83024). A post-hoc subgroup analysis of results from clinical research in adults with a history of recent stroke or ischemic attack suggests that taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 does not increase cancer risk overall, although it was associated with an increased risk of cancer in patients who also had diabetes (90378). Also, in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, population research has found that consuming at least 8.6 mg daily of supplemental vitamin B6 during treatment was associated with a lower overall survival rate over 5 years, as well as a reduced progression-free survival, when compared with non-users and those with intakes of up to 8.6 mg daily (107134).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nPyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Intravenous vitamin B6 is effective for controlling pyridoxine-dependent seizures.\nPyridoxine-dependent seizures are a rare type of refractory seizures in neonates that do not respond to anticonvulsant drugs. These seizures are typically controlled within minutes of intravenous administration of pyridoxine, a form of vitamin B6. Pyridoxine-dependent seizures can be due to genetic (autosomal recessive) pyridoxine dependency, or more commonly, a result of the use of high-dose pyridoxine during pregnancy (8197, 8198).\nless\nSideroblastic anemia. Oral vitamin B6 is effective for treating hereditary sideroblastic anemia.\nTaking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) orally is effective for treating hereditary sideroblastic anemia (15, 9518). Taking the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) also seems to be effective in cases in which the patient does not respond to pyridoxine (93049).\nless\nVitamin B6 deficiency. Oral vitamin B6 is effective for preventing and treating vitamin B6 deficiency.\nTaking oral vitamin B6 can prevent and treat vitamin B6 deficiency (15).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHyperhomocysteinemia. Taking vitamin B6 orally, alone or in combination with folic acid, is effective for reducing hyperhomocysteinemia.\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) seems to lower homocysteine concentrations when folic acid and vitamin B12 are at physiologic levels or when given with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements (9451, 83042, 107136). A combination of vitamin B6 100 mg and folic acid 0.5 mg daily seems to lower homocysteine levels by about 35% and is recommended for people with postprandial hyperhomocysteinemia (1489, 9406). Other research shows that taking pyridoxine 50-200 mg daily reduces postprandial homocysteine levels by 32% to 35% (9406, 10350). Pyridoxine also seems to reduce homocysteine levels in patients with kidney failure, kidney transplant patients (1489, 6884, 9414, 9415), or patients who receive general anesthesia with nitrous oxide (9481). However, some research in healthy adults suggests that adding pyridoxine to folic acid might not provide any additional benefit over folic acid alone (9400, 9405, 9409, 50145).\n\nHyperhomocysteinemia is considered by some to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, recurrent thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke (1899, 3323, 9402, 9405, 9408, 9409). However, elevated homocysteine levels may be a marker, as opposed to a cause, of vascular disease (11387, 11388). A 5 µmol/L increase in plasma homocysteine increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease by 50% and the odds of coronary heart disease by 60% and 80% in males and females, respectively (9407, 9411). However, it is not clear if reducing homocysteine levels results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (1489, 6883, 6884, 9308, 9400, 9405, 9409). Folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 supplementation can reduce total homocysteine from 13.4 to 11 µmol/L. However, this reduction does not seem to help with secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction, and some research even suggests an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 97619). There is also debate about whether supplementation with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins can reduce the risk of stroke. A number of large clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with CVD or impaired renal function (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 96150). However, a more recent meta-analysis shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo in patients at risk for or with a history of CVD (97619). Also, a meta-analysis in patients with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and the risk of vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo (107136).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAntipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia.\nClinical research in male patients with hyperprolactinemia who are on a consistent antipsychotic dose shows that taking vitamin B6 300 mg twice daily for 16 weeks reduces serum prolactin levels by 68%, compared with 37% in patients taking aripiprazole 5 mg twice daily. Also, 67% of patients taking vitamin B6 had prolactin levels less than 40 mcg/mL versus 2% of those taking aripiprazole (107128).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral vitamin B6 seems to decrease urinary oxalate levels and decrease the risk of kidney stone formation in some patients.\nThere is some evidence that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) orally, alone or in combination with magnesium, can decrease urinary oxalate levels in people with type I primary hyperoxaluria, a hereditary disorder (1201, 6437, 6438, 6439, 6440, 8548, 8549, 8550). Additionally, a small clinical study in this population suggests that intravenous pyridoxine hydrochloride can reduce urinary oxalate by 25.5% when compared to baseline (90796). In patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria, taking a combination of pyridoxine 25mg and magnesium oxide 400 mg for 3 months decreases urinary oxalate by approximately 16%, with 68% of patients experiencing a reduction. However, supplementation is less effective than following a low-oxalate diet, which reduces urinary oxalate in 91% of patients by an average of 31% (107127). There is also preliminary evidence that higher pyridoxine intake in females with no history of kidney stones is associated with decreased risk of kidney stone formation (6441), but this association has not been found in males (6442).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral vitamin B6 may reduce nausea and vomiting in some pregnant patients and is sometimes used in combination with doxylamine.\nWhile some conflicting evidence exists, most small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin B6 is effective for improving nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy when compared with baseline or placebo. However, vitamin B6 may not be as effective as ginger (110459). Two small clinical studies show that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 25 mg every 8 hours for 3-4 days decreases pregnancy-induced nausea severity and vomiting incidence when compared with placebo (6168, 16306). A larger clinical trial shows that taking lower doses of vitamin B6, 10 mg every 8 hours over 5 days, improves pregnancy-induced nausea, but not vomiting, when compared with placebo (6167). A small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate nausea and vomiting shows that taking a higher dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days is more effective than placebo, but no better than ginger 500 mg twice daily (99404). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) considers vitamin B6 at a dose of 10-25 mg 3 to 4 times daily a first-line treatment for pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting due to its benign safety profile (111601). However, it is not effective for all patients, such as those with hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Adding vitamin B6 20 mg three times daily for 2 weeks to intravenous rehydration, metoclopramide, and thiamine seems to be no more effective than placebo for reducing vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum (99405).\n\nVitamin B6 is also sometimes used in combination with doxylamine. In fact, a combination of vitamin B6 plus doxylamine (Diclegis or Bonjesta, Duchesnay Inc., and various generics) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a prescription product111601). ACOG recommends vitamin B6 in combination with doxylamine as another first-line treatment option (111601). However, the clinical trial used to obtain FDA approval has some methodological problems, and the significance of the results has been questioned. The improvement in symptom scores seen with Diclegis was less than one point on a 13-point scale, which is unlikely to be clinically significant (97998). Also, some clinical research shows that taking pyridoxine 25 mg and doxylamine 12.5 mg is less effective than ondansetron 4 mg when taken every 8 hours for 5 days. Only 41% of the patients using pyridoxine and doxylamine had a clinically significant reduction in nausea, compared to 92% of patients using ondansetron (90797).\n\nThe combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine is also studied with acupuncture. A large clinical study in patients with moderate to severe pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting conducted in China shows that taking vitamin B6-doxylamine (Diclegis, Duchesnay, Inc) 20 to 40 mg each at bedtime for 14 days in combination with daily acupuncture modestly improves patient-reported nausea and vomiting scores when compared with either intervention alone (111820). However, it is unclear whether this improvement is clinically significant.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral vitamin B6 seems to reduce PMS symptoms.\nThere is some evidence that taking oral vitamin B6 can improve symptoms of PMS such as breast pain or tenderness (mastalgia) and depression in some patients. Vitamin B6 in doses of at least 50 mg daily, plus magnesium oxide 200 mg daily, seems to relieve PMS-related anxiety and other symptoms (8555, 39007, 82962). Although some clinicians advocate doses of 200-500 mg daily for PMS, doses of 50-100 mg daily seem to work similarly well. There is no apparent dose-response curve for PMS, so the lowest effective dose should be used. Higher doses might increase the risk of side effects (3093).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to slow age-related cognitive decline.\nOne clinical trial in elderly people with memory complaints shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, and vitamin B6 (form not specified) 20 mg daily for 24 months reduces cerebral atrophy in the gray matter regions associated with Alzheimer disease by up to seven-fold when compared with placebo. However, this protection does not occur in patients with the lowest average blood levels of homocysteine (90374). Furthermore, other clinical research shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 3-75 mg daily in combination with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not improve cognitive function in elderly adults (14392, 50225, 50510).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease when used in combination with other B vitamins. Also, oral vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of developing this condition.\nClinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease taking routine medications shows that taking vitamin B6 25 mg with folic acid 5 mg and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for 18 months does not have a beneficial effect on cognitive function or the severity of disease when compared with placebo. In this study, all patients were consuming a folate-fortified diet (50319). Also, population research in elderly adults has found that a high intake of vitamin B6 from dietary or supplemental sources is not associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer disease when compared to lower vitamin B6 intake (13165, 15270).\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nMost research shows that people with carpal tunnel syndrome are not generally deficient in vitamin B6 and do not benefit from taking vitamin B6 supplements (8203, 8937, 9448, 9450, 9478, 9482). Although early studies by a single group of researchers, as well as anecdotal reports, suggest that taking vitamin B6 may relieve carpal tunnel symptoms, more reliable research has not supported these findings (8202, 9445, 9447, 9449, 9483, 15955, 83086).\n\nVitamin B6 has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin B6, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with a control (111702). The dose of vitamin B6 was not provided. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and placebo. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to vitamin B6, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCataracts. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to slow cataract development.\nClinical research in females with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at increased risk of CVD shows that taking a combination of folic acid 2.5 mg, vitamin B6 (form not specified) 50 mg, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for an average of 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of cataracts when compared with placebo. Furthermore, the risk of cataract extraction was increased by 28% (96149).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. While some conflicting evidence exists, most research suggests that oral or topical vitamin B6 does not seem to prevent or reduce the severity of acral erythema induced by chemotherapy.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials and 4 observational studies shows that taking vitamin B6 60-500 mg daily for up to 8 chemotherapy cycles does not prevent chemotherapy-induced acral erythema or reduce the incidence of severe cases when compared with control. Most studies used capecitabine chemotherapy alone or in combination, and one study used pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; however, no subgroup analysis was conducted to differentiate chemotherapy regimens. Results did not seem to vary based on study location, study design, or vitamin B6 dose (104930). However, a more recent preliminary clinical study in patients receiving doxorubicin for multiple myeloma shows that taking vitamin B6 100 mg on the first day of chemotherapy then twice daily for 7 days with each cycle reduces the risk of developing acral erythema by 72%, but does not improve the severity of acral erythema, when compared with no vitamin B6 supplementation (110458). Also, one small, low-quality clinical study suggests that taking vitamin B6 400 mg daily reduces the risk of moderate or severe chemotherapy-induced acral erythema when compared with vitamin B6 200 mg daily; however, the higher dose also seems to be associated with worsened tumor response and increased treatment failure (97620).\n\nTopical vitamin B6 has also failed to show benefit. A small clinical study in patients with acral erythema from capecitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin shows that applying vitamin B6 1% cream to affected areas three times daily for 6 weeks does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo (104929).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of developing colorectal adenomas.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 2.5 mg, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50 mg, and vitamin B12 1 mg, daily for up to 9.2 years does not reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma in females at high risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with placebo (90389).\nless\nEclampsia. Oral or intramuscular vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of eclampsia.\nMeta-analyses of limited clinical research in pregnant patients show that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), either as 25 mg daily or a single dose of 100 mg orally or intramuscularly, does not reduce the risk of eclampsia when compared with control (83046, 96166).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Oral vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.\nClinical research in patients with cerebrovascular disease shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 2 mg, vitamin B6 (form not specified) 25 mg, and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily for up to 10.5 years does not prevent osteoporotic fractures when compared with placebo (90377). Furthermore, a secondary analysis of two large studies in patients with cardiovascular disease has found that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 40 mg daily in addition to folic acid and vitamin B12 for 1-3 years is associated with a 42% increased risk of hip fracture over an 11-year period when compared with only folic acid and vitamin B12 (96163). This finding is limited because these studies were not designed to assess the effects of vitamin B6 on fracture risk and the analyses were not adjusted for baseline bone health or fall risk.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral or intramuscular vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.\nMeta-analyses of limited clinical research in pregnant patients show that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), either as 25 mg daily or a single dose of 100 mg orally or intramuscularly, does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo (83046, 96166).\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral or intramuscular vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk of preterm labor.\nMeta-analyses of limited clinical research in pregnant patients shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), either as 25 mg daily or a single dose of 100 mg orally or intramuscularly, does not reduce the risk of preterm labor when compared with placebo (83046, 96166).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults and children with inflammatory acne shows that taking 1-4 tablets of a specific product (NicAzel, Elorac Inc.) containing vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), nicotinamide, azelaic acid, zinc, copper, and folic acid for 8 weeks reduces inflammatory lesions and improves appearance in 88% and 81% of patients, respectively, when compared to baseline (90800). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large-scale clinical study shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50 mg, vitamin B12 1000 mcg, and folic acid 2.5 mg daily reduces the risk for AMD in females over 40 years of age with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with risk factors for CVD. Those who took this combination for an average of 7.3 years had a 34% reduced risk of developing AMD and a 41% reduced risk of visually significant AMD when compared with placebo (14620). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B6, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAngioplasty. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome evidence suggests that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 10 mg, folic acid 1 mg, and vitamin B12 400 mcg daily can decrease the rate of restenosis in patients treated with balloon angioplasty (8009, 9412). However, this combination does not seem to be as effective for reducing restenosis in patients after coronary stenting (8009). An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and vitamin B12 followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mcg, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after bare metal coronary stenting also does not seem to reduce restenosis and might actually increase restenosis (12150, 12151). Due to the lack of evidence of benefit and potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151). It is unclear if any effects are due to vitamin B6, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6, as an adjunct to progesterone, is beneficial in patients with antipsychotic-induced amenorrhea.\nA small clinical study in females with antipsychotic-induced amenorrhea shows that taking vitamin B6 80 mg three times daily for 1 month plus intramuscular progesterone daily for 5 days increases levels of estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone, reduces prolactin levels, and increases the rate of clinical efficacy, defined as the normalization of menstruation and improvement in endocrine indicators, by 14% when compared with progesterone alone (110457).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with anxiety.\nClinical research in college students shows that taking vitamin B6 100 mg daily for one month does not reduce anxiety scores when compared with placebo (110453). However, because a diagnosis of anxiety was not a requirement for study participation, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients diagnosed with anxiety.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with asthma.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 200-300 mg daily may improve symptoms of asthma in some patients, but not others, when compared with placebo (7064, 7065). Studies have yielded conflicting results, with some research suggesting that it may only be beneficial in children with severe asthma (7065). Additionally, some research suggests that theophylline may lower vitamin B6 levels, although it is unclear if vitamin B6 supplementation is beneficial (4522, 7066, 9503).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with intermediate risk for coronary heart disease shows that taking a specific supplement (Kyolic, Total Heart Health, Formula 108, Wakunga) containing vitamin B6 12.5 mg, aged garlic extract 250 mg, vitamin B12 100 mcg, folic acid 300 mcg, and L-arginine 100 mg daily for 12 months reduces coronary artery calcium progression when compared with placebo (88385). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B6, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical trial in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of vitamin B6 31.5 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and zinc 90 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not improve weightlifting performance when compared with placebo (113655).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with eczema.\nA small clinical study in children with eczema shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) 50 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce symptoms such as redness and itchiness when compared with placebo (83090).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for ADHD.\nA small crossover study in children with ADHD shows that taking vitamin B6 600 mg, niacinamide and ascorbic acid 3 grams, and calcium pantothenate 1.2 grams daily for 6 weeks does not improve behavior scores when compared with placebo (9957).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B6 for autism, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B6 for this condition.\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder.\nA small clinical trial in patients with type 1 bipolar disorder who are taking lithium and experiencing an acute episode of mania shows that taking vitamin B6 80 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve cognitive function or the severity of mania when compared with placebo. Cognitive function was reduced in patients taking vitamin B6; any effect on sleep was unclear (107132).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces overall cancer risk.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin B6 is associated with a 22% reduced risk of cancer, including esophageal, pancreatic, gastric, colorectal, and breast cancer. However, when dietary and supplemental vitamin B6 intake is considered, the inverse association between vitamin B6 and cancer risk is weaker and limited to fewer tumor sites. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 clinical studies shows that taking vitamin B6 3-100 mg orally daily for 2-7.3 years, in combination with vitamin B12 and folate, does not reduce the risk of cancer in patients with cardiovascular disease or kidney failure (96164).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral vitamin B6, taken along with other B vitamins, does not seem to improve secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction in patients with CVD. However, it might slightly lower the risk of stroke.\nOverall evidence from clinical research and meta-analyses shows that taking vitamin B6 in combination with folic acid and/or vitamin B12 does not seem to help with secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction in patients with or at risk for CVD (11387, 13482, 34540, 50423, 83050, 90379, 97619). In fact, some research suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 for secondary prevention increases the risk of CVD by 20% despite lowering homocysteine levels by 30% (13482). However, some research shows that taking vitamin B6 in combination with other B vitamins modestly reduces the risk of stroke, although results are conflicting (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 96150, 96165, 97619, 107136). Additionally, it is unclear which specific combination of B vitamins is optimal for reducing stroke risk and which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nIn 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in healthy adults aged 40-65 years shows that taking a supplement containing vitamin B6, ginkgo leaf, bacopa, and other B vitamins twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve memory or attention when compared with placebo (111334).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that the highest dietary intake of vitamin B6 is associated with a 20% reduced risk of colorectal cancer when compared with the lowest dietary intake. However, this association was not shown in subgroup analyses of studies conducted in Australia, Europe, or North America (111600). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nDental caries. There is limited evidence on the oral use of vitamin B6 for dental decay during pregnancy.\nMeta-analyses of limited clinical research show that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), 25 mg daily or a single dose of 100 mg orally or intramuscularly, may reduce the risk of dental decay during pregnancy when compared with placebo (83046, 96166).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces the risk of developing depression or improves symptoms of depression.\nClinical research in healthy college students shows that taking vitamin B6 100 mg daily for one month does not reduce depression scores when compared with placebo (1104453). However, because a diagnosis of depression was not a requirement for study participation, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients diagnosed with depression.\n\nWhether vitamin B6 reduces the risk of developing depression is also unclear. A meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest dietary intake of vitamin B6 is associated with a 19% lower risk of depression when compared with the lowest intake. However, sub-analyses suggest that this association is only relevant in females and not males (107133). In one individual population study in community dwelling older adults included in the analysis, the consumption of at least 1.71 mg of vitamin B6 daily from food was associated with a 43% reduction in the likelihood of becoming depressed when compared with the consumption of 1.33 mg or less daily in females. However, there was no association between vitamin B6 levels and risk of depression in males, and the finding in females was no longer significant when adjusted for total energy intake, since foods rich in vitamin B6 are energy-dense (96168). Another observational longitudinal study in healthy adults starting oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel has found that taking vitamin B6 25 mg daily for 6-12 months is associated with a 40% lower risk of depression when compared with no supplementation (90789). Most available studies are cross-sectional in nature, making any conclusions related to causation difficult.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in adults with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.\nObservational research in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that the highest quartile of dietary intake of vitamin B6 is associated with 53% lower odds of developing cardiovascular disease, defined as a non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, when compared with the lowest quartile of intake (110452). A small clinical trial in Iranian adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes shows that taking vitamin B6 300 mg orally daily, along with metformin 500 mg daily and lifestyle modifications for 1 month, reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose levels and improves markers of insulin resistance when compared with metformin and lifestyle modification or lifestyle modifications alone (115690). However, the validity of this study is limited by large differences in baseline characteristics, including HbA1C, between groups. Additionally, relevant changes in HbA1c would not be expected until about 3 months after treatment initiation.\n\nSmall clinical studies in adults with gestational diabetes and vitamin B6 deficiency shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 100 mg daily for 2 weeks improves glucose tolerance and blood glucose levels when compared with baseline (82967, 83088). However, there is concern that these findings were confounded by dietary alterations. This benefit was not observed in a subsequent small case series in patients with gestational diabetes (22380).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research suggests that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid (L-methylfolate), vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) for 24 weeks does not improve neural dysfunction based on vibration perception when compared with placebo in patients with diabetic neuropathy. However, taking this combination appears to modestly improve neuropathy symptoms and quality of life related to mental functioning when compared with placebo (90375).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin B6 (form not specified) 200 mg daily reduces pain associated with dysmenorrhea when compared with placebo. However, taking vitamin B6 in combination with magnesium does not reduce pain when compared with placebo (77388).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with fibromyalgia.\nA small clinical study in patients with fibromyalgia shows that taking vitamin B6 80 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve pain, disease severity, anxiety, depression, or quality of life when compared with placebo (110454).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for Helicobacter pylori.\nA large clinical study in adults with Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking vitamin B6 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks alongside conventional quadruple therapy does not improve eradication rates when compared with a control group not receiving vitamin B6 (113551). Conventional therapy consisted of a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, minocycline, and metronidazole. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of placebo and inadequate blinding.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces blood pressure.\nOne small clinical study in patients with essential hypertension shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) 5 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with baseline (83091). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces triglyceride levels.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that vitamin B6 (form not specified) 50 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels in people with hypertriglyceridemia when compared with placebo. However, vitamin B6 appears to decrease total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by approximately 9% in these patients (59028).\nless\nInfertility. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B6 for infertility, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B6 for this condition.\nInsomnia. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in healthy adults with self-reported sleep difficulty shows that taking a specific product (LZ Complex3, Sanofi Consumer Healthcare Pty Ltd.) containing vitamin B6, zizyphus extract, hops extract, hydrolyzed milk protein (Lactium), and magnesium oxide nightly, 30 minutes before bed, for 2 weeks does not improve sleep quality, daytime functioning, or physical fatigue when compared with placebo. However, due to the large improvement seen in both the treatment and placebo groups, the effectiveness of this product is unclear (95971).\nless\nIsoniazid-induced neuropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 prevents the development of neuropathy in patients taking isoniazid.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients taking isoniazid for tuberculosis shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 6 mg daily reduces the development of neuropathy when compared with control (83068).\nless\nLactation. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 helps to suppress postpartum lactation.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical trials shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 400-600 mg daily for 6-7 days postpartum does not suppress lactation when compared with no treatment (83047).\nless\nLevetiracetam-induced side effects. While some conflicting evidence exists, several small, low-quality studies suggest that oral vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may reduce some neuropsychiatric adverse effects related to the use of levetiracetam.\nIn an analysis of case reports, retrospective studies, and a single low-quality prospective study, improvement in levetiracetam-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in approximately 73% of patients taking pyridoxine (107137). A more recent preliminary clinical trial in children ages 1-17 years shows that taking pyridoxine 10 or 15 mg/kg daily as needed based on symptoms improves behavioral side effects associated with levetiracetam by a small amount when compared with low-dose pyridoxine 0.5 mg/kg daily used as placebo (107124). Also, observational research in children ages 9 months to 14 years has found that taking vitamin B6 is associated with improved behavior and a 44% lower risk of levetiracetam discontinuation when compared with no vitamin B6 supplementation (110455). Some observational research in adults with levetiracetam-associated irritability has found that taking vitamin B6 is associated with an improvement in irritability in 45% of patients when compared to baseline (107129). However, a small clinical trial in adults with epilepsy shows that taking pyridoxine 40 mg daily for 3 weeks does not improve levetiracetam-related psychiatric adverse effects when compared with placebo (110456). This study may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups. Pyridoxine doses used in the studies above have ranged from 50-400 mg daily in children and 40-600 mg daily in adults (107124, 107129, 107137, 110456).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if dietary or oral vitamin B6 reduces lung cancer risk.\nEpidemiological research has found that higher serum levels of vitamin B6 in male smokers is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer (9454). Also, people with blood levels of vitamin B6 in the top quartile have a modestly lower risk of lung cancer when compared with those whose levels are in the lowest quartile. The association is stronger for males and for people who have smoked (97999). However, other epidemiological research found that increased dietary intake of vitamin B6 is not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer (96164).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B6 for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B6 for this condition.\nMotion sickness. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B6 for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B6 for this condition.\nNausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for nausea and vomiting in patients taking oral contraceptives or antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori.\nA large clinical study in adults with Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking vitamin B6 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks alongside conventional quadruple therapy reduces the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with a control group not receiving vitamin B6 (113551). Conventional therapy consisted of a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, minocycline, and metronidazole. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of placebo and inadequate blinding. An observational longitudinal study in healthy females taking oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel has found that taking vitamin B6 25 mg daily for 6-12 months is associated with a 43% reduced risk of nausea when compared with no supplementation (90789).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 for patients with NAFLD.\nA small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 30 mg three times daily for 12 weeks does not reduce levels of liver transaminases or plasma lipids when compared with baseline. However, hepatic fat accumulation was modestly reduced (107130). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for overweight or obese individuals.\nA small clinical trial in females with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 25 kg/m2 shows that taking vitamin B6 as pyridoxine 80 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces fat mass and improves insulin resistance and triglyceride levels by a small amount when compared with placebo. Although some other anthropometric and metabolic indices were improved when compared with baseline, there was no effect of pyridoxine on body weight, visceral adiposity, or other endpoints when compared with placebo (107131).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces the risk of overall mortality.\nObservational research in US adults has found that dietary intake of vitamin B6 in the highest quintile is associated with a 12% to 21% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 31% to 44% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with the lowest quintile of dietary vitamin B6 intake (110451).\nless\nPain (acute). Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in adults with cervical sprains shows that taking vitamin B6 50 mg, thiamine 100 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, and dexketoprofen 25 mg orally every 8 hours for 7 days modestly reduces pain scores at days 3, 5, and 7 when compared with dexketoprofen alone (115689). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B6, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 reduces the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nObservational research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin B6 is associated with a 37% lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer when compared with lower intake (104927).\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with postpartum depression.\nPreliminary clinical research in individuals considered at increased risk for postpartum depression, but without clinical depression, shows that taking vitamin B6 80 mg daily from the 28th week of pregnancy until birth, and then 40 mg daily for one month, reduces symptoms of depression 1.5 months after birth when compared with baseline (measured during the third trimester) and when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear if any of the patients included in the study developed postpartum depression, as there were no changes in overall symptoms in patients taking placebo (107126).\nless\nProton pump inhibitor-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for proton pump inhibitor-induced GI symptoms.\nA large clinical study in adults with Helicobacter pylori infection shows that taking vitamin B6 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks alongside conventional quadruple therapy reduces the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with a control group not receiving vitamin B6 (113551). Conventional therapy consisted of a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, minocycline, and metronidazole. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of placebo and inadequate blinding.\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in patients with RLS.\nA small clinical study in adults with RLS who are beginning treatment with pramipexole shows that also taking vitamin B6 40 mg daily for 2 months moderately improves RLS scores and sleep quality scores when compared with pramipexole and placebo (110052).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\nClinical research in male patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who are on a consistent antipsychotic dose shows that adding vitamin B6 300 mg twice daily for 16 weeks modestly improves psychotic symptoms and some measures of cognitive performance when compared with adding aripiprazole 5 mg twice daily (107128). More research is needed to determine if these benefits are clinically relevant.\nless\nSeizures. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial for preventing seizures in patients with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiency.\nObservational case series in a small number of children and young adults with GPI deficiency has found that taking vitamin B6 20-30 mg/kg daily for 3-12 months is associated with some reduction in seizure frequency in 9 of 13 patients. However, no patient reached seizure freedom (107125, 107135). In one case series, treatment for 12 months was associated with modest developmental improvements in almost all patients (107135). The study patient populations were slightly different in terms of age and underlying genetic causes for GPI deficiency.\nless\nSickle cell disease. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other B vitamins; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin B6 4.2-6 mg, vitamin B12 4.2-6 mcg, and folic acid 700 mcg daily might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is unknown if this will reduce the risk of endothelial damage in these patients (9324).\nless\nSleep deprivation. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical trial in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of vitamin B6 31.5 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and zinc 90 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not affect sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue the next day when compared with placebo (113655).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6, either alone or with other B vitamins, is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nThere is some debate about whether supplementation with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins, including vitamin B6, can reduce the risk of stroke. A number of clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or impaired kidney function (11387, 13482, 50423, 83050, 96150). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials, including over 44,000 patients at risk for or with a history of CVD, shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo (97619). This meta-analysis differed from some of the earlier analyses due to the inclusion of several additional clinical trials. Also, another meta-analysis of three clinical trials including 9900 patients with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% when compared with placebo, although this finding was determined to have a low level of certainty. Based on two clinical trials, there was also a 17% reduced risk of vascular death and an 11% reduction in the combined risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death (107136).\n\nIn 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease (102368). Unfortunately, even after the publication of higher quality research, it is still unclear which specific combination of B vitamins is optimal and which patients are most likely to benefit. One network meta-analysis shows that a combination of folic acid and vitamin B6 lowers the risk of stroke more effectively than B vitamin mixtures that include vitamin B12 (96165). However, this analysis is limited because it didn't account for dosing. Exposure to low, but not high amounts, of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) seems to reduce stroke risk (96150).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 prevents tardive dyskinesia in patients taking neuroleptic drugs.\nA small clinical study in patients taking neuroleptic drugs for schizophrenia shows that taking vitamin B6 (form not specified) 400 mg daily seems to improve Parkinsonian, dystonic, and dyskinetic symptoms when compared with placebo (8558).\nless\nTourette syndrome. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, nonblinded clinical study in children aged 4-17 years with untreated Tourette syndrome or with chronic tic disorder and associated symptoms of anxiety shows that taking a liquid nutritional supplement providing vitamin B6 2.8 mg and L-theanine 200 mg daily for 2 months improves scores on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, but does not reduce anxiety, when compared with patients receiving psychoeducation (108555). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nVincristine-induced neuropathy. Oral vitamin B6 has only been evaluated in combination with pyridostigmine; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children ages 11 months to 13 years with neuropathy due to vincristine treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, shows that taking vitamin B6 150 mg/m2 and pyridostigmine 3 mg/kg twice daily for 3 months is associated with reduced severity of sensory and motor neuropathy when compared with baseline (104928). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nGastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral vitamin B6 is beneficial in children with gastroenteritis.\nA small clinical study in children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute viral gastroenteritis shows that taking vitamin B6 (form not specified) does not improve symptoms of dehydration or the frequency of vomiting when compared with placebo (90793).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin B6 for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B6 are: males 19-50 years, 1.3 mg; males over 50 years, 1.7 mg; females 19-50 years, 1.3 mg; females over 50 years, 1.5 mg; pregnancy, 1.9 mg; and lactation, 2 mg (6243).\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B6 by age are: 0-6 months, 0.1 mg; 7-12 months, 0.3 mg; 1-3 years, 0.5 mg; 4-8 years, 0.6 mg; 9-13 years, 1 mg; males 14-18 years, 1.3 mg; females 14-18 years, 1.2 mg (6243).\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn most clinical studies, vitamin B6 has been given alone or in combination with other B vitamins, usually folic acid and vitamin B12. In most trials, vitamin B6 is administered as pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The absorption of vitamin B6 from food or supplements appears to be similar. Also, absorption of vitamin B6 from different supplement forms (e.g., pyridoxine vs. pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) is similar (6243).",

Similarly, clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that taking high doses of vitamin B6 may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, possibly by reducing plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine (83091).\nless\nLEVODOPA\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nVitamin B6 may increase the metabolism of levodopa when taken alone, but not when taken in conjunction with carbidopa.\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) enhances the metabolism of levodopa, reducing its clinical effects. However, this interaction does not occur when carbidopa is used concurrently with levodopa (Sinemet). Therefore, it is not likely to be a problem in most people (3046).\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nHigh doses of vitamin B6 may reduce the levels and clinical effects of phenobarbital.\nPreliminary clinical evidence suggests that vitamin B6 200 mg daily can reduce plasma levels of phenobarbital, possibly by increasing metabolism. It is not known whether lower doses have any effect. Advise people taking phenobarbital to avoid high doses of vitamin B6 (3046, 10801).\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nHigh doses of vitamin B6 may reduce the levels and clinical effects of phenytoin.\nPreliminary clinical evidence suggests that vitamin B6 200 mg daily can reduce plasma levels of phenytoin, possibly by increasing metabolism.

An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mcg, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after coronary stenting might actually increase restenosis rates (12150). Due to the potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents (12151).\nless\nBARIATRIC SURGERY\nFollowing bariatric surgery, a 50-year-old female taking vitamin B6 300 mg daily for 6 months developed plasma levels of pyridoxal phosphate that were at least 61 times higher than normal levels. The elevated pyridoxal phosphate level was associated with nausea, vomiting, and browning skin (96169). Due to the potential for harm, supplemental vitamin B6 at levels above the dietary reference intakes (DRI) should not be recommended following bariatric surgery.\nless",

            "Nutrient Depletions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nANTIBIOTIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, antibiotics might reduce levels of vitamin B6 in the blood.\nSome sources suggest that destruction of the normal gastrointestinal flora by antibiotics can decrease production and plasma levels of vitamin B6. However, there is no evidence that the gastrointestinal flora is a significant source of vitamin B6 in humans (4436, 4437, 9502). Supplementation with vitamin B6 is not necessary during antibiotic therapy. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nCYCLOSERINE (Seromycin)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nCycloserine increases vitamin B6 excretion and can cause vitamin B6 deficiency.\nCycloserine interacts with pyridoxal phosphate to form inactive hydrazones, which inhibit pyridoxal kinase and increase vitamin B6 excretion in the urine (2677, 4459, 9501). This loss of vitamin B6 likely contributes to the neurotoxicity and seizures associated with cycloserine (2677, 9501). Vitamin B6 supplements reduce the incidence of these side effects. It is recommended that people taking cycloserine also take vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 150-300 mg/day (3022, 8894, 9501). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nESTROGENS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nEstrogens might reduce blood levels of vitamin B6. However, low doses are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect.\nEstrogens can interfere with vitamin B6 metabolism. Reduced plasma pyridoxal phosphate levels may occur with oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy (4459, 4498, 9504, 9505, 9506). It is suggested that low vitamin B6 levels contribute to depression, lethargy, and fatigue sometimes associated with oral contraceptives (4459, 9504, 9505). But there is not reliable evidence that vitamin B6 supplements prevent or treat these symptoms. Also, there is some evidence that with low-dose estrogen contraceptives, levels return to normal despite continued therapy (9510). In general, use of oral contraceptives or postmenopausal estrogens does not necessitate vitamin B6 supplementation. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nFUROSEMIDE (Lasix)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nFurosemide might modestly reduce blood levels of vitamin B6 in patients with kidney failure.\nLimited data suggests that acute use of intravenous furosemide in people with kidney failure increases urinary excretion of vitamin B6 (8896, 9525). However, people with hypertension treated with oral diuretics for several years seem to have normal serum vitamin B6 levels (1898). Vitamin B6 supplements are not usually necessary with furosemide or other diuretics. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nHYDRALAZINE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHydralazine might increase vitamin B6 excretion and reduce blood levels.\nHydralazine can cause vitamin B6 deficiency in some patients, probably by reacting with pyridoxal phosphate to form an inactive hydrazine, which is excreted (2677, 4533). Give vitamin B6 supplements to people taking hydralazine who develop early signs of peripheral neuropathy, such as paresthesias, numbness, and tingling (3022, 4533). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nISONIAZID\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nIsoniazid might increase vitamin B6 excretion and lead to symptoms of deficiency.\nIsoniazid interacts with vitamin B6 to form an inactive hydrazine, which inhibits pyridoxal kinase and increases vitamin B6 excretion in the urine. This depletes body stores of vitamin B6 and can lead to peripheral neuritis (2677, 4459). It is rare in people receiving up to 5 mg/kg daily isoniazid (8894). With higher doses of isoniazid, consider vitamin B6 supplements, 40-250 mg daily, especially in people with a history of seizures, and in those with other risk factors for neuropathies, including malnutrition, uremia, diabetes, alcoholism, or liver disease (2677, 4459, 4481, 4482, 8894). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nPENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nPenicillamine might reduce vitamin B6 activity and lead to symptoms of deficiency.\nPenicillamine inhibits the activity of vitamin B6, possibly by forming an inactive complex with pyridoxal phosphate (4534). This has been linked to the development of peripheral and optic neuropathy (8897). When penicillamine is used for treatment of Wilson's Disease, it's recommended that patients take vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 25 mg dilay (3092). Guidelines haven't been established for the use of vitamin B6 with penicillamine in the treatment of other conditions, although supplements of 50-150 mg daily have been used (4534, 8897). Monitor patients for early signs of peripheral neuropathy, such as paresthesias, numbness, and tingling, and give vitamin B6 supplements if these occur. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin B6, see our chart.\nless\nTHEOPHYLLINE\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTheophylline might lower vitamin B6 levels, although the clinical effects of this depletion are unclear.\nTheophylline inhibits pyridoxal kinase, which catalyzes phosphorylation of vitamin B6 to its active form, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. People treated with theophylline tend to have reduced plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels (4522, 7064, 7066, 8898, 9480, 9503). The clinical significance of this is not clear, although it is suggested that vitamin B6 deficiency contributes to neurological and CNS side effects of theophylline, including seizures (7066, 8899, 9503). Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplements of 10-300 mg daily have been tried in people taking theophylline, but results are conflicting (7064, 8898, 8899, 9503). Although plasma levels are sometimes returned to normal, it's not clear if there is any clinical benefit.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with vitamin B6.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nVitamin B6 is absorbed passively in the upper gastrointestinal tract (90790).\nMetabolism\nIn the liver, vitamin B6 is converted to the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate (15, 90790).\nExcretion\nVitamin B6 metabolites are excreted in the urine (93501).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin B6 is required for amino acid metabolism. It is also involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (15). In the body, vitamin B6 is converted to the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate for a wide variety of metabolic reactions. These reactions include transamination of amino acids, conversion of tryptophan to niacin, synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the CNS, metabolism of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids, and the synthesis of the heme component of hemoglobin (15). Vitamin B6 deficiency in adults principally affects the peripheral nerves, skin, mucous membranes, and hematopoietic system. In children, the CNS is also affected. Deficiency can occur in people with uremia, alcoholism, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption syndromes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and in those receiving certain drugs (15).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nDecreased vitamin B6 concentrations are associated with increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an indicator of inflammation that is implicated in increased cardiovascular morbidity (9452).\nAntioxidant effects\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) has some antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, which might explain its beneficial effects on tardive dyskinesia (8558).\nBlood pressure lowering effects\nPreliminary clinical and animal research suggests that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can reduce blood pressure. Potential mechanisms of action included prevention of overproduction of endogenous aldehydes and improved glucose metabolism (30859, 82959, 83091, 83093).\nCarpal tunnel effects\nIt has been suggested that large doses of vitamin B6 may be useful in carpal tunnel syndrome, based on an observation of low vitamin B6 tissue levels in autopsy specimens from people who had the syndrome (6885). However, tissue levels decline in dead or infarcted tissue, and the existence of vitamin B6 deficiency during life cannot be deduced from these observations (6885).\nHomocysteine-lowering effects\nVitamin B6 is a cofactor for enzymes involved in one of the two pathways for the metabolism of homocysteine. Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and vitamin B12 (9407, 9409). Folic acid supplements increase the activity of this pathway, lowering fasting homocysteine levels. Vitamin B6 is not involved in this pathway and therefore does not affect fasting homocysteine levels (9400, 9406). Trans-sulfuration of homocysteine to form cystathionine is catalyzed by cystathione-beta-synthase, which is vitamin B6 dependent (2148, 9407, 9409). This pathway is primarily active after ingesting a methionine load (i.e., after a meal). Deficiencies of vitamin B6 or cystathione-beta-synthase impair this pathway, raising post-methionine load homocysteine levels (1489, 2148, 9408). Vitamin B6 supplements can lower post-methionine load homocysteine levels (1489, 7881). Evidence suggests elevated homocysteine levels might cause vascular endothelial cell damage, impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide activity, increased oxidation and arterial deposition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased platelet adhesiveness, and activation of the clotting cascade (9403, 9408, 9411).\nImmune effects\nVitamin B6 is thought to be beneficial in the immune response. Vitamin B6 is required for antibody production (83017). Also, in critically ill patients, vitamin B6 increases the number of T lymphocyte, T helper, and T suppressor cells (83008).\nNeurological effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin B6 for reducing sensory reactivity in neurodivergent adults and children. A small clinical trial in college students with high baseline sensory over-responsivity (SOR) scores shows that taking vitamin B6 100 mg orally daily for 1 month reduces SOR scores when compared with placebo (115688).\nOxalate excretion effects\nFor kidney stones, vitamin B6 is thought to be beneficial by decreasing urinary excretion of oxalate in some patients. Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, and high urinary oxalate has been associated with development and recurrence of kidney stones. In patients with type I primary hyperoxaluria, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) seems to reduce stone formation by shifting the breakdown of the oxalic acid precursor, glyoxalic acid, to glycine as opposed to oxalic acid (6437, 6438, 6439, 6440, 6441, 6442, 8205).\nSerotonin effects\nIn attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), some kids can have low serotonin levels (41). However, this is controversial (6444). It's thought that vitamin B6 can increase serotonin levels and might improve symptoms in some kids with low serotonin levels (41). Some researchers think vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation might also be useful for some dysphoric mental states because it increases the production of serotonin and GABA, but the evidence is still preliminary (8554)."

            "Overview": "Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for human survival (90946). Unlike many other mammals, humans do not produce vitamin C, so sufficient levels must be obtained from the diet (90946). Dietary sources of vitamin C include various fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges (90946).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Some experts suggest taking vitamin C 200 mg daily to prevent COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections, or 1-2 grams daily at the onset of symptoms to improve recovery. These doses are likely safe in most adults, but there is no strong evidence to support the effectiveness of vitamin C for the prevention of COVID-19 or treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. There is some evidence that vitamin C might prevent mortality in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. Ensure that patients considering vitamin C for COVID-19 follow healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods as well.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally, topically, intramuscularly, or intravenously and appropriately. Vitamin C is safe when taken orally in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Tell patients not to exceed the UL of 2000 mg daily (1959, 4713, 4714, 4844). ...when used intravenously or intramuscularly and appropriately. Injectable vitamin C is an FDA-approved prescription product (15) and has been used with apparent safety in clinical trials up to 150 mg/kg daily for up to 4 days (114489) and up to 200 mg/kg daily for up to 2 days (114492).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg daily can significantly increase the risk of adverse effects such as osmotic diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset (4844).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (4844, 10352, 14443).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 400 mg daily for children ages 1 to 3 years, 650 mg daily for children 4 to 8 years, 1200 mg daily for children 9 to 13 years, and 1800 mg daily for adolescents 14 to 18 years. Higher doses can cause osmotic diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset (4844).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (4844).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients over age 19 not to use doses exceeding the UL of 2000 mg daily when pregnant or breast-feeding and for those 14-18 years of age not to use doses exceeding 1800 mg daily when pregnant or breast-feeding. Higher doses can cause osmotic diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset. Large doses of vitamin C during pregnancy can also cause newborn scurvy (4844); avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, intravenously, and topically, vitamin C is well-tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal cramps, esophagitis, heartburn, headache, osmotic diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. Kidney stones have been reported in those prone to kidney stones. Adverse effects are more likely to occur at doses above the tolerable upper intake level of 2 grams daily.\n\nTopically: Irritation and tingling.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been rare case reports of carotid inner wall thickening after large doses of vitamin C.\n\nIntravenously: There have been case reports of hyperoxalosis and oxalate nephropathy following high-dose infusions of vitamin C.\nCardiovascular\nEvidence from population research has found that high doses of supplemental vitamin C might not be safe for some people. In postmenopausal adults with diabetes, supplemental vitamin C intake in doses greater than 300 mg per day is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. However, dietary intake of vitamin C is not associated with this risk. Also, vitamin C intake is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients without diabetes (12498).\n\nOral supplementation with vitamin C has also been associated with an increased rate of carotid inner wall thickening in men. There is preliminary evidence that supplemental intake of vitamin C 500 mg daily for 18 months can cause a 2.5-fold increased rate of carotid inner wall thickening in non-smoking men and a 5-fold increased rate in men who smoked. The men in this study were 40-60 years old (1355). This effect was not associated with vitamin C from dietary sources (1355).\n\nThere is also some concern that vitamin C may increase the risk of hypertension in some patients. A meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that, in pregnant patients at risk of pre-eclampsia, oral intake of vitamin C along with vitamin E increases the risk of gestational hypertension (83450). Other clinical research shows that oral intake of vitamin C along with grape seed polyphenols can increase both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients (13162). Three cases of transient hypotension and tachycardia during intravenous administration of vitamin C have also been reported (114490).\nless\nDental\nOrally, vitamin C, particularly chewable tablets, has been associated with dental erosion (83484).\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, vitamin C might cause tingling or irritation at the site of application (6166). A liquid containing vitamin C 20%, red raspberry leaf cell culture extract 0.0005%, and vitamin E 1% (Antioxidant and Collagen Booster Serum, Max Biocare Pty Ltd.) has been reported to cause mild tingling and skin tightness (102355). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin C, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, the adverse effects of vitamin C are dose-related and include nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, heartburn, abdominal cramps, gastrointestinal obstruction, and diarrhea. Doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg per day can increase the risk of adverse effects such as osmotic diarrhea and severe gastrointestinal upset (3042, 4844, 96707, 104450, 114493, 114490). Mineral forms of vitamin C, such as calcium ascorbate (Ester-C), seem to cause fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects than regular vitamin C (83358). In a case report, high dose intravenous vitamin C was associated with increased thirst (96709).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, vitamin C may cause precipitation of urate, oxalate, or cysteine stones or drugs in the urinary tract (10356). Hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, hematuria, and crystalluria have occurred in people taking 1 gram or more per day (3042, 90943). Supplemental vitamin C over 250 mg daily has been associated with higher risk for kidney stones in males. There was no clear association found in females, but the analysis might not have been adequately powered to evaluate this outcome (104029). In people with a history of oxalate kidney stones, supplemental vitamin C 1 gram per day appears to increase kidney stone risk by 40% (12653). A case of hematuria, high urine oxalate excretion, and the presence of a ureteral stone has been reported for a 9-year-old male who had taken about 3 grams of vitamin C daily since 3 years of age. The condition resolved with cessation of vitamin C intake (90936).\nless\nHematologic\nProlonged use of large amounts of vitamin C can result in increased metabolism of vitamin C; subsequent reduction in vitamin C intake may precipitate the development of scurvy (15). In one case, a patient with septic shock and a large intraperitoneal hematoma developed moderate hemolysis and increased methemoglobin 12 hours after a high-dose vitamin C infusion. The patient received a blood transfusion and the hemolysis resolved spontaneously over 48 hours (112479).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, the adverse effects of vitamin C are dose-related and include fatigue, headache, insomnia, and sleepiness (3042, 4844, 83475, 83476).\nless\nRenal\nHyperoxalosis and oxalate nephropathy have been reported following high-dose infusions of vitamin C. Hyperoxalosis and acute kidney failure contributed to the death of a 76-year-old patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung who received 10 courses of intravenous infusions containing vitamins, including vitamin C and other supplements over a period of 1 month. Dosages of vitamin C were not specified but were presumed to be high-dose (106618). In another case, a 34-year-old patient with a history of kidney transplant and cerebral palsy was found unresponsive during outpatient treatment for a respiratory tract infection. The patient was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, initiated on vasopressors, hydrocortisone, and antibacterial therapy, and received 16 doses of vitamin C 1.5 grams. Serum creatinine level peaked at greater than 3 times baseline and the patient required hemodialysis for oliguria and uncontrolled acidosis. Kidney biopsy revealed oxalate nephropathy with concomitant drug-induced interstitial nephritis (106625). In another case, a 41-year-old patient with a history of kidney transplant presented with fever, nausea, and decreased urine output 4 days after receiving intravenous vitamin C 7 grams for urothelial carcinoma. Serum creatinine levels increased from 1.7 mg/dL to 7.3 mg/dL over those 4 days, and hemodialysis was initiated 3 days after admission due to anuria. Renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of acute oxalate nephropathy (109962).\nless\nOther\nIntravenously, hypernatremia and falsely elevated ketone levels is reported in a patient with septic shock and chronic kidney disease after a high-dose vitamin C infusion. The hypernatremia resolved over 24 hours after cessation of the infusion (112479).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nVitamin C deficiency. Oral or intramuscular vitamin C is effective for preventing or treating vitamin C deficiency.\nAdministering vitamin C orally or intramuscularly prevents and treats vitamin C deficiency, including scurvy. Vitamin C administration can reverse complications of scurvy within 2 days to 3 weeks (4844). In newborns with transient tyrosinemia due to vitamin C deficiency, oral or intramuscular vitamin C can correct this condition (15).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAnemia of chronic disease. Oral vitamin C seems to improve markers of anemia in patients on hemodialysis.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in hemodialysis patients with anemia shows that treatment with vitamin C 200-300 mg three times weekly for 3-6 months increases hemoglobin levels by approximately 0.9 grams/dL, increases transferrin saturation by about 8%, and decreases the required recombinant human erythropoietin dose by 17 U/kg weekly when compared with standard care (83447, 83475).\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. Oral and intravenous vitamin C seems to help prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgeries.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin C prior to and after cardiac surgery reduces the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 27% to 53%. Most studies administered vitamin C at doses of 1-2 grams orally daily for 1-3 days prior to cardiac surgery, followed by 1-2 grams in two divided doses daily for 4-5 days after cardiac surgery. Some studies provided vitamin C intravenously at similar doses, but oral vitamin C seems to be more effective (91233, 96703, 96705). Despite these findings, a meta-analysis of clinical research conducted only in the U.S. does not support the benefit of vitamin C for reducing postoperative atrial fibrillation (96703). These differences may be related to lifestyle factors such as nutrition, as well as differences in hospital treatments.\n\nVitamin C has also been studied in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with evidence of benefit (90701).\nless\nBowel preparation. Powdered vitamin C is approved for use as part of a polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation for colonoscopy.\nClinical research shows that treatment with 2 liters of oral solution containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus vitamin C achieves a similar quality of bowel cleansing as treatment with 4 liters of PEG when administered on the evening prior to colonoscopy or when administered in a split-dose regimen. Patients given 2 liters of PEG plus vitamin C solution also have better adherence and experience fewer adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal bloating, compared to patients treated with 4 liters of PEG solution without vitamin C (90413, 90415, 90420, 90424, 90428). This treatment also appears to be effective and tolerable in elderly patients aged 60-79 years, including those with poor bowel habits and a high number of comorbidities (108085). Other clinical research in older adults undergoing bowel preparation for colonoscopy also shows that taking 1 liter of PEG plus vitamin C (CleanViewAL, Taejoon Pharm) results in similar quality of bowel cleansing overall and per segment with similar tolerability and adverse effects as sodium picosulfate 170 mL plus magnesium citrate or oral sulfate solution alone (111297, 112476).\n\nThe most common PEG plus vitamin C preparation used in clinical research is MoviPrep (Norgine BV), which contains macrogol 3350 100 grams, sodium sulfate 7.5 grams, sodium chloride 2.7 grams, potassium chloride 1 gram, vitamin C 4.7 grams, and sodium ascorbate 5.9 grams per liter of solution (90413, 90415, 90424). In the U.S., MoviPrep is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bowel preparation prior to a colonoscopy.\nless\nCataracts. Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamin C may reduce the risk of developing cataracts.\nPopulation research suggests that people with the highest total intake of vitamin C have about a 19% reduced risk of developing cataracts when compared with those with the lowest total intake, with the most benefit observed for nuclear cataracts (96711). Additionally, another observational study shows that higher supplemental intake of vitamin C over 10 years is associated with a 60% reduction in the incidence of nuclear and cortical cataracts (4208). Other population research suggests that individuals with the highest blood levels of vitamin C have a 33% lower odds of developing age-related cataract, but any benefit is limited to Asian populations (90944). An umbrella review of meta-analyses also shows that dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a 27% lower odds of cataract development (112095).\n\nHowever, a prospective clinical study shows that a combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene does not prevent age-related loss of vision from cataracts in well-nourished people with an average supplementation duration of 6.3 years (7304).\nless\nCommon cold. When taken orally by asymptomatic adults or children, vitamin C seems to modestly decrease the severity and duration of newly developing common cold symptoms. However, vitamin C does not seem to be beneficial for common cold prevention in most people. Also, starting vitamin C after symptoms have started does not seem to be beneficial for common cold treatment.\nWhen taken prior to symptom onset, oral vitamin C seems to decrease the severity and duration of newly developing common cold symptoms in children and adults. A meta-analysis of clinical research in healthy children and adults shows that taking vitamin C 1-4 grams daily for one week to 5 months reduces the severity of cold symptoms by 13% and the duration of severe symptoms by 26% when compared with control. Taking vitamin C also limits absences from daily activities. However, the duration of mild symptoms was not reduced (113665). In addition, another meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin C orally, typically in doses of 1-2 grams daily for several weeks to months, decreases the duration of cold symptoms by 1-1.5 days compared with controls (83487).\n\nDespite these findings, taking vitamin C prior to symptom onset does not seem to prevent developing a common cold in most people; however, there may be some benefit in individuals undergoing extreme physical stress. Most clinical trials show that vitamin C supplementation prior to symptom onset does not reduce the risk of developing a cold in healthy adults and children (7101, 83487). Also, dietary intake of vitamin C does not seem to be associated with common cold risk (10780). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin C supplementation decreases the incidence of the common cold by almost 50% in individuals exposed to short-term physical stress, such as marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers in subarctic conditions when taken prior to the stressful activity (83487). Also, a large clinical study in army recruits undergoing basic military training shows that taking vitamin C 6 grams daily for one month reduces the odds of getting a cold by 20% when compared with placebo (102975).\n\nVitamin C has also been investigated for common cold treatment. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin C after symptom onset, usually 1-4 grams daily for up to 5 days, does not reduce the duration of symptoms when compared with control (83487). However, the validity of this meta-analysis is limited by the lack of available clinical trials after 2001.\nless\nComplex regional pain syndrome. Most research shows that taking oral vitamin C after a distal radius (i.e. wrist) fracture or surgery seems to reduce the risk of developing complex regional pain. However, it is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in reducing the risk of complex regional pain in other orthopedic surgeries.\nAlthough some research has found no benefit in patients with distal radius (i.e. wrist) fractures (90411, 96702), most clinical research shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily, and possibly doses of up to 1500 mg daily, for 45-50 days beginning immediately after fracture can reduce the risk of developing complex regional pain syndrome (2045, 16302, 96700, 96706). Reasons for discrepancies are unclear but might relate to differences in diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (96702).\n\nResearch in patients undergoing various orthopedic surgeries has also shown benefit with the use of vitamin C for the prevention of complex regional pain syndrome; however, some findings are conflicting. (90422, 108076, 115613). One meta-analysis of clinical research in patients undergoing ankle, foot, or wrist surgery shows that taking vitamin C 500-1000 mg for 42-50 days following surgery reduces the rate of complex regional pain syndrome, and may improve pain following ankle or foot surgery, when compared with placebo (108076). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of included trials. An additional meta-analysis of clinical research in patients undergoing a broader variety of orthopedic surgery types (i.e., ankle, foot, knee, shoulder, wrist) shows that taking vitamin C 500 to 1500 mg does not reduce the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome (115613). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may relate to the inclusion of a wide range of orthopedic surgeries.\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. Oral vitamin C seems to reduce the risk of respiratory infections associated with strenuous exercise.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin C supplementation decreases the incidence of the common cold by almost 50% in individuals exposed to short-term physical stress, such as marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers in subarctic conditions when taken prior to the stressful activity (83487). Other preliminary clinical research shows that prophylactic use of vitamin C in doses of 600 mg to 1 gram daily for 3-8 weeks before heavy physical exercise, such as a marathon, prevents upper respiratory infections that sometimes follow heavy exercise (9831, 83370). More recently, high doses of vitamin C have been studied. A large clinical study in army recruits undergoing basic military training shows that taking vitamin C 6 grams daily for one month reduces the odds of getting a cold by 20% when compared with placebo (102975).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral vitamin C seems to reduce lipid levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily for at least 4 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 8 mg/dL and reduces triglycerides by about 20 mg/dL when compared with control (83445).\nless\nHypertension. Oral vitamin C seems to modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension, but some evidence is conflicting.\nVitamin C seems to modestly reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP), without meaningful effects on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (2044, 9822, 13162, 83483, 102974). A meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials in patients with hypertension, with or without other comorbidities, shows that taking a median dose of vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces SBP but not DBP by about 5 mmHg. Some of the studies used vitamin C in combination with other supplements, such as vitamin E and magnesium. When studies assessing vitamin C alone were analyzed, the magnitude of reduction in SBP decreased (83483). A newer meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with essential hypertension shows that taking vitamin C 200 mg or more daily reduces SBP by about 4 mmHg and DBP by about 2 mmHg (102974). However, this newer analysis omitted numerous relevant studies and included studies with normotensive patients and those without an adequate control, limiting the validity of its findings.\n\nIn contrast, a network meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies comparing five different vitamins in adults with essential hypertension shows that vitamin C does not reduce SBP, DBP, mean 24-hour SBP, mean 24-hour DBP, or heart rate when compared with placebo and when indirectly compared with vitamin B2, vitamin D, vitamin E, and folic acid. However, the included studies were of low quality and high heterogeneity, particularly in dosing, limiting the validity of the results (113668).\nless\nLaser skin resurfacing. Topical vitamin C seems to reduce erythema occurring after cosmetic laser skin resurfacing procedures intended to reduce scars and wrinkles.\nThere is some evidence that an aqueous formulation of topical vitamin C can decrease the degree and duration of erythema following cutaneous carbon dioxide laser resurfacing for scar and wrinkle removal (1959).\nless\nLead toxicity. Dietary vitamin C seems to lower concentrations of lead in the blood.\nObservational research has found that consuming more vitamin C from dietary sources is associated with lower blood concentrations of lead. People who consumed at least 340 mg of vitamin C daily as part of the diet had lower blood lead levels than those who consumed less than 100 mg vitamin C daily (3097, 3098, 3099).\nless\nNitrate tolerance. Oral vitamin C might prevent nitrate tolerance in some patients.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking vitamin C orally seems to prevent the development of nitrate tolerance in patients taking sublingual nitroglycerin. There is some evidence that short-term vitamin C supplementation can prevent tolerance to the vasodilatory effects of nitrates (1441, 1961).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Oral or intravenous vitamin C might prevent acute postoperative pain following certain surgeries. It is unclear if vitamin C reduces chronic postoperative pain.\nA meta-analysis of 7 small clinical studies in adults undergoing elective surgery shows that receiving perioperative vitamin C, either as 1 gram orally, 2-3 grams intravenously, or 50 mg/kg intravenously, modestly reduces acute pain and opioid requirements for up to 24 hours when compared with control (105457). Most surgeries were laparoscopic and included cholecystectomy, colectomy, hysterectomy; two non-laparoscopic surgeries included uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy and major abdominal surgery (90418, 99840, 105457).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery (i.e., orthopedic, abdominal, gynecologic, kidney transplantation) shows that administering perioperative vitamin C, either orally or intravenously, reduces postoperative intravenous morphine requirements at 2, 24, and 48 hours after surgery and improves pain scores at 2, 6, and 24 hours after surgery when compared with placebo. The dose of vitamin C did not appear to impact outcomes. However, when only laparoscopic surgeries are included, perioperative vitamin C does not improve pain or morphine use when compared with placebo (108087).\n\nUse of vitamin C perioperatively has also been evaluated in other surgery types with generally similar outcomes. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults undergoing total hip arthroplasty shows that intravenous vitamin C 3 grams perioperatively reduces 24-hour post-operative morphine use and subjective pain scores when compared with placebo; however, these improvements do not appear to be clinically significant (115500). The validity of these results is limited by a short follow-up period. Additionally, a small observational study in adults undergoing surgery for wisdom tooth extraction shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg three times daily for 7 days in addition to standard treatment reduces pain 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery when compared with control (113664). However, a moderate-sized clinical study in adults undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor under general anesthesia shows that administering intravenous vitamin C 1 gram after induction of anesthesia reduces the incidence and severity of catheter-related bladder discomfort immediately after surgery and at 1 and 2 hours postoperatively, but not 6 hours, when compared with placebo. Further, vitamin C does not reduce postoperative pain scores or analgesic requirements when compared with placebo (111645).\n\nVitamin C has also been evaluated for reducing chronic pain after surgery. Clinical research in patients undergoing surgery for foot or ankle trauma shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg orally twice daily postoperatively for 6 weeks reduces pain scores when compared with placebo at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. The mean total amount of diclofenac used for pain relief over the 6-week period is also reduced, from 5.7 grams with placebo to 3.4 grams with vitamin C (102131).\nless\nWrinkled skin. Topical vitamin C might reduce the appearance of existing wrinkles.\nTopical preparations containing vitamin C seem to improve the appearance of wrinkled skin. Some evidence shows that vitamin C 3% applied for 12 weeks might reduce facial wrinkles (14008). A small clinical study shows that applying a dissolving microneedle patch containing vitamin C 5.6% every 4 days for 12 weeks to crow's feet on one side of the face reduces wrinkles when compared to control treatment applied on the other side of the face (98780). Other clinical research in females aged 30-60 years shows that applying an oil-soluble cream containing the vitamin C derivative tetra-isopalmitoyl ascorbic acid 1%, 2%, or 3% to the periorbital area twice daily for 8 weeks reduces visual wrinkle grading when compared with placebo. A dose analysis shows greater improvements in wrinkle parameters, average wrinkle depth, and mean depth with the lower concentration, while greater improvements in maximum roughness and maximum depth are observed with the higher concentration (108072). This study only included individuals defined as having Fitzpatrick skin type III or IV; it effects on other skin types is unclear.\n\nPreparations containing vitamin C in combination with other ingredients have also been investigated. A small low-quality trial in females with moderately photodamaged and hyperpigmented facial skin shows that applying a moisturizer with vitamin C 30%, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 once daily in the morning, along with applying retinol 0.5% once daily or once every other day for 12 weeks, seems to improve skin tone, photodamage, and wrinkles when compared to baseline (99085). In another small trial, a topical preparation containing vitamin C 10% as L-ascorbic acid along with acetyl tyrosine, zinc sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, and bioflavonoids (Cellex-C High Potency Serum) applied to photo-aged facial skin for 3 months improves fine and coarse wrinkling, yellowing and sallowness, roughness, and skin tone when compared with placebo (6155). It is unclear if the beneficial effects of these products are due to vitamin C, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAcute bronchitis. Oral vitamin C doesn't seem to improve symptoms of acute bronchitis.\nA clinical study in adults with acute bronchitis shows that taking vitamin C orally 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg on days 2 through 5 (similar to an azithromycin regimen) doesn't seem to have any effect on quality of life or bronchitis duration when compared with azithromycin (9827).\nless\nAsthma. Oral vitamin C doesn't seem to prevent asthma or improve lung function.\nAlthough some observational research has found that some patients with asthma might have lower serum vitamin C levels (5873), other observational research found that increased dietary vitamin C intake is not associated with a reduced risk of asthma or improved lung function (15006, 34567). In addition, clinical research shows that supplemental intake of vitamin C does not reduce asthma symptoms, improve lung function, or reduce the use of inhaled steroids in asthma patients (90409).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis.\nA clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product containing slow-release vitamin C 250 mg and vitamin E 136 IU (CellaVie, Ferrosan A/S) twice daily modestly slows the 3-year progression of atherosclerosis of the carotid artery in males, but not females. This result persisted at a 6-year follow-up of this study (1918, 10473). However, when this form of vitamin C is used alone, it does not slow the 3-year progression of atherosclerosis of the carotid artery (1918).\nless\nBladder cancer. Oral vitamin C does not reduce the risk of bladder cancer or mortality from bladder cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that supplemental vitamin C intake is not associated with mortality rate in patients with bladder cancer (9839). A secondary analysis of a large clinical trial, the Physicians' Health Study II, in healthy men aged at least 50 years also shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily alone or with vitamin E 400 IU daily for up to 10 years does not reduce the risk of developing bladder cancer or bladder cancer-related deaths when compared with placebo (90097).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral vitamin C does not seem to be beneficial for either primary or secondary CVD prevention.\nVitamin C does not seem to be beneficial for primary prevention of CVD. Some population research has found that higher supplemental vitamin C or dietary vitamin C has been associated with a reduced risk of developing CVD (10358, 14108, 109779), while other observational research has found no benefit (34566, 10358, 14108). However, meta-analyses of clinical research in healthy patients show that vitamin C supplementation does not prevent CVD or coronary heart disease when compared with control (97308, 104025). In 2004, the American Heart Association stated that current evidence does not justify use of antioxidants such as vitamin C for reducing the risk of CVD (12142).\n\nEvidence is also negative for secondary prevention in people with coronary heart disease. Population studies have found that higher serum vitamin C was associated with no effect or decreased CVD mortality from CVD (3910, 5878). A meta-analysis of two large clinical trials shows that vitamin C supplementation does not reduce CVD events or CVD mortality when compared with control (97308).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral supplemental vitamin C does not seem to prevent colorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C prevents colorectal cancer.\nMost clinical trials show that supplemental vitamin C, alone or along with other antioxidants, does not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer development, colorectal cancer or adenoma recurrence, or colorectal cancer-related mortality (34580, 34581, 34594, 90089, 90097, 92903). Vitamin C has also been evaluated in observational research. A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies suggests that higher dietary vitamin C intake is associated with a 45% reduced relative risk of colorectal cancer. However, this finding is limited by significant heterogeneity (116121).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent neonatal death.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of neonatal death (83472, 96707).\nless\nFractures. Oral vitamin C does not seem to improve fracture healing.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily for 50 days following an acute distal radial fracture does not improve physical function, symptoms, or healing rates when compared with placebo (90411).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral vitamin C does not seem to improve eradication of H. pylori.\nMost clinical research shows that treatment with vitamin C, alone or in combination with vitamin E, does not improve the eradication rate of H. pylori when taken with a standard eradication regimen when compared with the eradication regimen alone (83476, 90094).\nless\nHereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Oral vitamin C does not seem to improve neuropathy in these patients.\nIn a meta-analysis of five studies in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, taking vitamin C 1-4 grams orally daily for 1 year did not improve neuropathy when compared with placebo (99084). Continuing vitamin C 4 grams daily for 2 years also does not improve neuropathy in these patients (90419).\nless\nInterferon-related retinopathy. Oral vitamin C does not seem to improve retinopathy associated with interferon therapy.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving interferon therapy shows that taking vitamin C 600 daily orally does not seem to reduce the risk of retinopathy from interferon therapy when compared with control (10355).\nless\nLeukemia. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of leukemia or mortality from leukemia.\nA large clinical trial in men aged at least 50 years shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily, alone or along with vitamin E 400 IU daily, for up to 10 years does not reduce the risk of developing leukemia or leukemia-related deaths when compared with placebo (90097).\nless\nLow birth weight. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of infants being born with a low birth weight.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that maternal use of oral vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of giving birth to infants with low birth weight when compared with control (83450, 83472).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of lung cancer.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that taking vitamin C, alone or in combination with vitamin E, does not reduce the incidence of lung cancer or lung cancer-related mortality (34528, 34632). Also, a clinical study in females shows that taking supplemental vitamin C 500 mg daily, with or without vitamin E and beta carotene, is associated with an INCREASED risk of lung cancer when compared with placebo (34580). However, another large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests that moderate dietary intake of vitamin C around 500 mg daily is protective against lung cancer, but higher doses of vitamin C might increase the risk of lung cancer (112096).\nless\nMelanoma. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of melanoma.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily, alone or along with vitamin E 400 IU daily, for up to 10 years does not reduce the risk of developing melanoma or melanoma-related deaths when compared with placebo in men aged at least 50 years (90097).\nless\nMiscarriage. Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of miscarriage.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of miscarriage when compared with control (94820).\nless\nOverall mortality. Oral vitamin C does not reduce overall mortality.\nAlthough population research suggests that higher dietary intake and higher plasma vitamin C levels are associated with a reduced risk of mortality from all causes (3910, 109779), vitamin C supplementation does not seem to affect overall mortality. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin C supplements does not reduce overall mortality when compared with control (34622, 111641). Clinical studies of vitamin C used in combination with vitamin E, beta carotene, and/or selenium and zinc, also show no benefit for overall mortality (9817, 14109).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent pancreatic cancer. However, it is unclear if intravenous vitamin C is beneficial for treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nObservational research has found that increased dietary vitamin C intake is associated with up to a 30% reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (99083, 99086). However, clinical research shows that supplemental vitamin C 500 mg daily does not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer in females (34580). Also, taking vitamin C in combination with beta-carotene plus vitamin E does not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer (12185, 34581).\n\nWhile research suggests oral vitamin C may not prevent pancreatic cancer, intravenous vitamin C is being explored in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. A small, open-label clinical study in adults with stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma shows that administration of intravenous vitamin C 75 grams three times weekly throughout each cycle of chemotherapy increases median overall survival and progression free survival by approximately 8 months and 2 months, respectively, when compared with chemotherapy alone (115499). The validity of these results is limited by potential overestimation of treatment effects, influenced by small sample size, differences in chemotherapy doses, and early study termination.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent pre-eclampsia.\nDespite some early positive research in high-risk pregnancies, the majority of meta-analyses and clinical studies show that taking vitamin C alone or with vitamin E or other supplements does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with control. There is even some concern that vitamin C supplementation may increase the risk of gestational hypertension (3236, 83450, 83472, 83474, 96707).\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent preterm labor.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of preterm labor when compared with control (83450, 83472, 96707, 117199). Specifically, the most recent meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in approximately 1900 adults shows that taking vitamin C 100-1000 mg daily during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 9 clinical studies in approximately 18,000 adults shows that taking vitamin C 500-1000 mg daily in combination with vitamin E during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of preterm birth when compared with placebo (117199).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent prostate cancer. However, it is unclear if intravenous vitamin C is beneficial for the treatment of prostate cancer.\nA large-scale clinical study (The SU.VI.MAX study) shows that a combination of vitamin C 120 mg, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 30 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and zinc 20 mg, taken daily for an average of 8 years, does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer overall. However, it might reduce the risk of prostate cancer in those who have normal PSA levels. It does not seem to be beneficial for reducing the risk of prostate cancer in patients with PSA levels above 3 mcg/L (14135).\n\nAnother large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily for an average of 8 years does not significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared with placebo (16708). Similarly, results from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial seem to show that supplemental or dietary intake of vitamin C does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared to individuals not taking vitamin C (14124).\n\nWhile research suggests oral vitamin C may not prevent prostate cancer, intravenous vitamin C is being explored in the treatment of prostate cancer. A small clinical study in adults with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer shows that administration of intravenous vitamin C 1 gram/kg twice weekly in combination with docetaxel for up to 24 weeks does not reduce prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by 50% or more when compared with docetaxel alone (115611). This study may have been underpowered to show a difference between groups.\n\nVitamin C has also been evaluated in observational research. A meta-analysis of 13 observational studies suggests that higher dietary vitamin C intake is associated with a 12% reduced relative risk of prostate cancer. However, supplemental vitamin C is not associated with prostate cancer risk (116121).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. Topical vitamin C does not seem to prevent radiation dermatitis in cancer patients.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a 10% vitamin C solution does not appear to protect from radiation dermatitis when applied to the scalps of patients treated with radiation for intracranial tumors (789).\nless\nSmall for gestational age (SGA). Oral vitamin C does not seem to reduce SGA.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of small for gestational age birth when compared with control (83450, 83472).\nless\nStillbirth. Oral vitamin C does not seem to prevent stillbirth.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that maternal use of vitamin C alone or with other supplements does not reduce the risk of stillbirth when compared with control (83472, 96707).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral vitamin C, even at high doses, does not seem to speed recovery from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients. Most studies show that oral or intravenous vitamin C given to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 does not improve organ function or survival, but the evidence is conflicting. It is unclear whether vitamin C is beneficial for long COVID.\nA clinical study in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 shows that taking oral vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 8000 mg in 2-3 divided doses daily, alone or with zinc gluconate 50 mg daily, for 10 days does not reduce symptom severity when compared with standard care (104450). The study was terminated prior to complete enrollment due to futility and apparent lack of effect from vitamin C and/or zinc supplementation. Limitations of this study include a lack of placebo control and blinding. Additionally, this study has been criticized for methodologic concerns (106624). Another small clinical trial in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 14 days does not improve symptoms or quality of life when compared with placebo (109462).\n\nVitamin C has also been evaluated in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A very large analysis of two multinational clinical studies in critical and non-critical adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that administering intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 96 hours does not improve organ support-free days or survival and has a high probability of futility and worsened outcomes when compared with placebo (113666). Individual prospective and retrospective studies in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in various countries have found that administering vitamin C, either enterally as 500-1000 mg daily or intravenously as 8-24 grams daily or 50 mg/kg daily, does not significantly reduce in-hospital or short-term mortality, hospital length of stay, or end-organ failure when compared with control groups receiving standard care alone. Additionally, all but one study found no change in the need for mechanical ventilation (105458, 105465, 106937, 106938, 108075, 108079, 108081).\n\nHowever, a meta-analysis and some small individual studies have found that vitamin C is modestly beneficial for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials and 9 observational studies in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that receiving oral or intravenous vitamin C daily reduces the odds of in-hospital mortality by 41% when compared with control. When only clinical trials were considered, the odds of in-hospital mortality were decreased by 56%; however, this reduction was only identified in studies using vitamin C 10 grams daily or less. Conversely, supplementation with vitamin C increased the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay by nearly 2 days and did not impact length of hospital stay or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, liver injury, or cardiac injury (109955). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 8 clinical studies in primarily hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 shows that vitamin C administered orally or intravenously decreases the risk of all-cause mortality by 16% when compared with control (114488). Additionally, a small study found a small improvement in survival when compared with standard care; however, the overall survival rate in this study was low (108075). Another clinical study in patients hospitalized in Turkey with COVID-19 shows that adding high-dose intravenous sodium ascorbate 50 mg/kg to a treatment regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc may improve recovery time, with 57% and 39% of patients achieving total recovery at day 15 in the vitamin C and control groups, respectively (108071). However, the validity of this trial is limited due to unclear reporting.\n\nVitamin C has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients in patients with long COVID. Preliminary clinical research in adults with long COVID and persistent fatigue shows that taking a specific combination product containing vitamin C 500 mg and L-arginine 1.66 grams (Bioarginina C, Farmacetici Damor) for 28 days increases 6-minute walk test distance by 10% and reduces self-reported fatigue when compared with placebo (110390). However, it is unclear whether these effects are due to vitamin C, L-arginine, or the combination.\nless\nSepsis. Intravenous vitamin C, alone or in combination with thiamine and/or hydrocortisone, does not prevent organ failure, reduce intensive care or hospital length of stay, or reduce mortality in sepsis or septic shock.\nObservational research suggests that patients with septic shock are more likely to have low plasma levels of vitamin C (100317). However, randomized clinical trials in patients with sepsis or septic shock show no benefit with intravenous vitamin C, with or without thiamine, for improving organ function and preventing organ failure when compared with control treatment (102130, 104027, 108078, 109459, 111643, 114489, 117200). Also, a small clinical study in patients with septic shock shows that intravenous vitamin C 50 or 150 mg/kg daily for 4 days does not improve the duration of hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or mortality rate when compared with placebo (114489). Another small clinical study in patients with septic shock shows that administering an intravenous bolus of vitamin C 1000 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 250 mg/hour for 96 hours, starting within 24 hours of vasopressor initiation, does not improve 28-day or ICU mortality when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis shows that the addition of corticosteroids does not affect outcomes in either group (108078). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Also, a larger clinical trial in adults with sepsis receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU shows that intravenous administration of vitamin C 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for up to 4 days INCREASES the risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28 by 14% to 21% when compared with placebo. There were no differences in mortality at 6 months (109459, 111643). Earlier initiation of vitamin C therapy has also been of interest. A large clinical study in adults admitted to the emergency department with suspected sepsis shows that administering vitamin C 1500 mg within 6 hours of admission and then every 6 hours for 4 days also does not reduce the rate of organ dysfunction, 28-day mortality rates, or length of hospital or ICU stay when compared with placebo (117200).\n\nVitamin C has also been frequently studied in patients with sepsis and septic shock in a specific combination regimen (HAT therapy) which includes intravenous vitamin C 1.5-2 grams with hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours and thiamine 200 mg every 12 hours. While some retrospective research has found HAT therapy to be beneficial in sepsis (100315, 102980), high quality, prospective clinical research has not confirmed these findings (105447, 106620, 109956). Several meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and small clinical studies in patients with sepsis or septic shock show that intravenous vitamin C, either alone, as a component of HAT therapy, or in combination with thiamine, does not reduce short- or long-term mortality, ICU or hospital length of stay, kidney injury, or duration of mechanical ventilation, but modestly improves duration of vasopressor use and procalcitonin clearance, when compared with placebo or standard care. These analyses also show mixed results with respect to improvement in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores within 72 hours (105447, 106620, 106935, 108073, 109460, 111298, 111300, 111301, 111642, 112479). Most studies included in the analyses administered HAT therapy for 2-10 days and compared it with normal saline control or with hydrocortisone alone (102129, 102998, 104027, 104028, 104032, 105446). Although some subgroup analyses suggests that intravenous vitamin C alone in patients with sepsis may improve short-term mortality (106620, 111298), other meta-analyses have not shown this benefit in subgroup analyses (111300). In addition, meta-analyses have identified significant publication bias (111298, 111300). Long-term follow up from a study in patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or cardiovascular dysfunction shows that receiving HAT therapy does not improve cognitive, psychological, or functional status after 6 months and, for some domains, HAT therapy was worse when compared with placebo (111299).\n\nStudies evaluating intravenous vitamin C, either alone, as a component of HAT therapy, or in combination with thiamine, in mixed critically ill populations have also shown mixed findings. Four meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies show that intravenous vitamin C does not have a significant effect on the length of hospital stay, mortality at 1 month, ICU mortality, use of invasive ventilation, use of renal replacement therapy, organ function, or incidence of kidney injury when compared with placebo or standard care. The meta-analyses reach conflicting conclusions on whether intravenous vitamin C reduces the risk of in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and the duration of ICU stay. When only data from low risk-of-bias clinical trials are considered, the effects of intravenous vitamin C on mortality at any point are no longer significant (106933, 106934, 109957, 113663). However, a subgroup analysis in one of these analyses suggests that intravenous vitamin C as monotherapy, or in doses of at least 10 grams daily, may improve overall mortality (106934).\n\nVitamin C also does not appear to benefit complications from sepsis, such as vasoplegic shock. A small clinical study in adults in the ICU with vasoplegic shock mostly secondary to sepsis and requiring moderate vasopressor support shows that administering intravenous vitamin C as sodium ascorbate 1.5 grams every 6 hours for 5 days or until cessation of vasoactive therapy does not reduce the duration of vasopressors, vasopressor dose, hospital or ICU length of stay, or mortality outcomes when compared with placebo (112475).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if topical vitamin C is beneficial for post acne erythema.\nA small split-face clinical study in adults with persistent post acne erythema shows that applying a vitamin C solution 10% with microneedling over 4 treatment sessions reduces erythema when compared to baseline but not when compared with applying tranexamic acid with microneedling (116123). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of placebo. Also, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if dietary vitamin C or oral vitamin C taken in combination with other ingredients prevents AMD.\nAn umbrella review of meta-analyses shows that increased dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with 21% higher odds of developing AMD (112095). A population study suggests that vitamin C intake is associated with increased odds of developing age-related maculopathy (9823). However, other population studies have found no association between dietary or supplemental vitamin C intake and the risk of developing AMD (14007, 14257).\n\nWhen taken in combination with other ingredients, most clinical and population research shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg along with other antioxidants such as vitamin E 400 IU, beta-carotene 15 mg, and/or elemental zinc 80 mg reduces the risk of visual acuity loss by 23% to 27%, progression to advanced AMD at 5 years by 25% to 32%, and AMD overall (7303, 7304, 11326, 14257, 90069). The antioxidant plus zinc combination seems to reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD in these patients more than taking the antioxidants without zinc (7303, 90069).\n\nMore evidence is needed to determine what role, if any, vitamin C intake has on the risk of developing AMD.\nless\nAging skin. Topical vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in females aged 30-65 years shows that applying a specific liquid (Antioxidant and Collagen Booster Serum, Max Biocare Pty Ltd.) containing vitamin C 20%, red raspberry leaf cell culture extract 0.0005%, and vitamin E 1% to the face nightly for 8 weeks, in addition to regular facial skin products, improves skin color, elasticity, radiance, smoothness, and appearance of wrinkles when compared with regular facial skin products alone (102355).\nless\nAlbuminuria. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that taking vitamin C 1250 mg plus vitamin E 680 IU daily for 4 weeks can reduce the excretion of albumin by about 19% when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (10434).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in patients with hay fever.\nEpidemiological research has found that higher vitamin C plasma levels are not associated with a decreased risk of allergic rhinitis (15200). However, clinical research shows that some forms of vitamin C might help. In one small clinical study, intranasal vitamin C administered three times daily for 2 weeks reduces nasal secretions, nasal blockage, and edema in up to 74% of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (15201). Another small clinical study in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis shows that taking a single oral dose of vitamin C 2 grams reduces bronchial responsiveness to histamine at one hour after ingestion (15202). However, in another small study in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis taking vitamin C orally in doses up to 4 grams daily for 3 days does not appear to suppress cutaneous or nasal response to histamine when compared to placebo (15203).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C helps to prevent this condition.\nMost epidemiological research has found that dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a 17% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease (4636, 9824, 10131, 13165, 90082).\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent ALS.\nObservational research has found that increased dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C is not associated with risk of developing ALS (90412).\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin C for anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin C for this condition.\nAspirin-associated gastric damage. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent gastric damage caused by aspirin.\nSome clinical research shows that vitamin C 480 mg might prevent gastric damage associated with taking aspirin 400 mg by decreasing blood loss and preventing decreased gastric blood flow (10357). However, a small clinical study in healthy patients shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg as ascorbic acid with aspirin 600 mg actually increases gastrointestinal permeability to a greater extent than either ingredient taken alone (98781).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin C improves athletic performance.\nAlthough some small preliminary clinical studies suggest that vitamin C might improve certain biomarkers during exercise (82922), a meta-analysis of small clinical trials in older and younger adults shows that taking vitamin C 500-1000 mg daily, with or without vitamin E, does not improve endurance, lean mass, or muscle strength when compared with placebo (102973). A more recent, small clinical study in recreationally trained males shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) 235 mg daily for 10 weeks while participating in a resistance training program does not improve measures of muscle strength when compared with placebo (109959).\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C helps to prevent atopic disease.\nPopulation research has found that higher intake of vitamin C is not associated with a reduced risk of eczema, wheeze, IgE-mediated food allergy, or allergic sensitization (90098).\nless\nAtrophic acne scars. It is unclear if applying topical vitamin C after microblading improves atrophic acne scars.\nA clinical study in adults with mild to severe atrophic acne scarring shows that applying a serum containing vitamin C 17% to the face after a once-monthly home microblade treatment for 4 months improves the appearance of acne scars at month 5 when compared with baseline (108086). Although this study enrolled a control group that used topical insulin in place of vitamin C, no between-group statistical comparisons were conducted, limiting the validity of this study.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Small clinical studies suggest that high-dose oral vitamin C may not improve symptoms in patients with ADHD.\nSome research suggests that taking megadose vitamins, including vitamin C, does not improve ADHD symptoms (9957, 9958, 9959). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking 25 mg of vitamin C in combination with flaxseed oil providing alpha-linolenic acid 200 mg twice daily might improve measures of attention, impulsivity, restlessness, and self-control in children with ADHD when compared with baseline (14443). It is not clear if these effects are due to vitamin C, flaxseed oil, or the combination.\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in patients with autism spectrum disorder.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking vitamin C 8 grams per 70 kg daily for 10 weeks modestly reduces autism symptom severity in school children when compared with placebo (83604).\nless\nBleeding. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C can reduce bleeding after total abdominal hysterectomy.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy shows that administration of intravenous vitamin C 1 gram the night before surgery and 1 gram during surgery reduces postoperative hemorrhage volume by around 40 mL when compared with placebo (109465).\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent brain tumors.\nPopulation research has found that vitamin C intake is associated with a 14% reduced risk of glioma. This risk reduction was more prevalent in America compared to other geographic locations (98782).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent breast cancer, its recurrence, or breast cancer-related mortality.\nA meta-analysis of 36 observational studies suggests that higher dietary, but not supplemental, vitamin C intake is associated with a 13% reduced relative risk of breast cancer (116121). However, included in this meta-analysis was a large cohort study conducted in the U.S which found no association between breast cancer risk and total, dietary, or supplemental vitamin C, regardless of dose, treatment duration, or formulation (single ingredient or combination product). Additionally, hormone and menopausal status did not appear to impact risk. Vitamin C intake might be associated with a reduced risk in individuals with a family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives (108080).\n\nIn patients with breast cancer, supplemental or dietary intake of vitamin C might be associated with a reduced risk of mortality. A meta-analysis of results from population research shows that vitamin C supplementation following breast cancer diagnosis is associated with a 15% lower risk of breast cancer-related mortality when compared with no supplementation (90416). A large, observational study in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy has found that vitamin C supplementation does not reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence over a period of 5 years when compared with no supplementation. Although the vitamin C group had notably less aggressive tumor types, recurrence-free survival was similar in both vitamin C and control groups (108082). The validity of these findings is limited due to unknown doses of vitamin C and the inclusion of various breast cancer subtypes.\nless\nBurns. Small studies suggest that intravenous vitamin C may modestly improve symptoms in patients with severe burns.\nA small clinical study in patients with severe burns shows that administering vitamin C intravenously (IV) 66 mg/kg hourly over 24 hours, as part of fluid resuscitation using lactated ringer solution, reduces wound edema and the volume of fluid needed when compared with fluid resuscitation alone (83145). A retrospective review of adults hospitalized with severe burns has found that those who receive a continuous IV infusion of at least 10 grams of vitamin C within 2 days of admission have an in-hospital mortality rate of 46%, compared with 58% for those who do not receive vitamin C (102128).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin C helps to prevent cancer or cancer-related mortality.\nSome population research has found that DIETARY intake of vitamin C is linked with a lower risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality (3910, 5878, 10819, 109779). However, clinical research shows that taking vitamin C SUPPLEMENTS does not reduce the risk for cancer (10819, 14109, 34580, 90097). In people with cancer, although some clinical research has shown that taking high-dose vitamin C supplements can improve survival rates (9809, 96704), other clinical research has not shown this benefit (4842, 4843). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that some scientific evidence suggests that antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin C, may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer. However, the FDA has determined that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim (102334).\n\nPreliminary clinical research has also evaluated vitamin C supplements in patients with cancer. High-dose oral vitamin C, 10 grams daily, in patients with advanced cancer does not seem to improve survival or decrease disease progression (4842, 4843, 106617). However, preliminary clinical research suggests high doses of vitamin C, given intravenously, might have a beneficial effect on some outcomes, including survival rate in some patients with cancer (9809, 96704, 106617). However, there is no benefit to other patients studied in the case reports and this has not been tested in well-designed clinical trials (9809, 96704).\nless\nCardiac arrest. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C is beneficial for patients after cardiac arrest.\nA small clinical study conducted in Slovenia in adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest shows that administering intravenous vitamin C 1.5 grams every 12 hours for 8 consecutive doses, with the first dose administered within 6 hours of resuscitation, in addition to standard care protects against arrhythmias and reduces the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay when compared with placebo and standard care. However, intravenous vitamin C does not appear to protect against neurological or myocardial injury, reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, reduce the duration of hospital stay, or increase survival when compared with placebo (113667).\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, and turmeric twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control (111702). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to vitamin C, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent cervical cancer.\nObservational research has found that higher vitamin C intake is associated with a 33% to 42% reduced odds of cervical neoplasm. Increasing vitamin C intake by 50 mg daily is associated with an 8% reduced odds of cervical neoplasm (34609, 98771).\nless\nChild growth. Some clinical research in pregnant smokers suggests that taking vitamin C during pregnancy may improve pulmonary function in the offspring from birth to 6 years of age.\nA meta-analysis of 4 data sets from one large clinical study in pregnant adults who smoke at least one cigarette daily shows that taking supplemental vitamin C 500 mg daily during pregnancy reduces lower airway resistance and improves lung capacity of the offspring at 0, 3, 12, and 60 months of age, but does not improve airway obstruction, when compared with control (113670). Additionally, one of the clinical studies included the meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin C during pregnancy lowers the occurrence of wheezing in offspring at 4-6 years of age (114496, 114497).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin C for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin C for this condition.\nColistin-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C helps to prevent nephrotoxicity from colistin.\nA small clinical study shows that intravenous administration of vitamin C 2 grams every 12 hours along with colistin for around 9-10 days does not prevent nephrotoxicity when compared with colistin therapy alone (99839). However, this study was limited by a lack of statistical power to detect differences between the study groups.\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).\nSome clinical research shows that taking vitamin C before and after coronary angiography reduces the risk of developing CIN by 33% to 55% when compared with placebo in patients with renal dysfunction (12234, 90421). However, other clinical evidence published since 2012 suggests that vitamin C given orally and/or intravenously before and after angiography does not reduce the risk of CIN compared with control in high-risk patients with chronic renal insufficiency or diabetes (91232, 91236, 90410, 90425). Reasons for the discrepancies are not entirely clear. However, it is possible that the lack of significant benefit from vitamin C in the latter studies results from the fact that incidences of CIN have become less common than in the past due to avoidance of dehydration, use of smaller catheters, and use of contrast agents with reduced nephrotoxicity (90429).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C helps to improve patient outcomes after CABG surgery.\nA small clinical study shows that giving vitamin C 5 grams intravenously (IV) before anesthesia induction and 5 grams in the cardioplegia solution used during surgery shortens the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by about 8 hours (102127). However, some limited research suggests that IV vitamin C does not resolve cardiac surgery complications. A small clinical study in patients with vasoplegia after receiving CABG and other cardiac surgeries shows that receiving IV vitamin C 1.5 grams every 6 hours after being admitted to the ICU does not improve vasoplegia when compared with control (102981).\nless\nDelirium. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research in adults with septic shock has found that receiving intravenous thiamine 400 mg daily with vitamin C 6 grams daily, both in divided doses, is not associated with reduced delirium when compared with control (103001).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if vitamin C in a chewing gum helps to reduce dental plaque formation.\nA small clinical study in patients with calculus shows that chewing 10 pieces of gum, each containing 60 mg of vitamin C, daily for 3 months reduces the formation of dental calculus, visible plaque, and the number of bleeding sites when compared not chewing gum (83303). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of placebo group.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of depression.\nA small clinical study in children and adolescents shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg orally twice daily in combination with fluoxetine 10-20 mg daily for 6 months reduces most symptoms of major depressive disorder when compared with taking fluoxetine alone (90404).\n\nHowever, a small clinical study in adults shows that taking vitamin C up to 1000 mg daily for 2 months does not improve the response rate or decrease symptoms of depression in adults also taking citalopram when compared with citalopram alone (96708). Reasons for these conflicting results may relate to the age of the patients, study duration, or differences in antidepressant medication being taken. One clinical guideline also provisionally recommends against the use of oral vitamin C to treat patients with depression based on low-quality evidence (110318).\n\nSome research has also evaluated vitamin C intake for the prevention of depression. A secondary analysis of pre- and peri-menopausal adults enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) program suggests that vitamin C intake is inversely associated with depressive symptoms. This association persisted regardless of age, race, physical activity, body mass index, antidepressant use or menopausal status (108083). The validity of these findings is limited due to the secondary nature of this study; additionally, follow-up time is unclear.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin C prevents diabetes. Some low-quality research suggests that vitamin C might improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nPopulation research has not found a link between dietary vitamin C and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004). However, low certainty clinical research has found some benefit of taking vitamin C supplements for glycemic control. Two meta-analyses of several small, heterogeneous clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking vitamin C 200-3000 mg daily for 2-48 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by approximately 11 mg/dL (112478) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by an average of 0.5% when compared with placebo, standard treatment, or no treatment (105461, 112478). Subgroup analyses suggest that durations of supplementation longer than 12 weeks show greater glycemic benefit, and although one meta-analysis suggests there is no dose-response relationship (105461), another meta-analysis suggests that doses of vitamin C 1000 mg and higher are most beneficial for improving glycemic indices (112478).\n\nSome research has evaluated the effects of vitamin C supplementation on the lipid profile in patients with diabetes, with mixed findings. One meta-analysis of 17 small clinical studies shows that taking vitamin C 200-3000 mg daily for 2 to 48 weeks improves levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Subgroup analysis suggests that study durations of at least 12 weeks show greater benefit (106621). However, two other meta-analyses in patients with diabetes, one of 16 small heterogenous clinical studies and one of 11 small clinical studies, show no clinically important improvement in lipid levels after vitamin C supplementation (105461, 105464).\nless\nDry mouth. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with vitamin E; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that taking vitamin E 100 IU and vitamin C 500 mg twice daily for an average of 3 months improves dry mouth when compared to baseline (99080). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of comparison with a control group.\nless\nEndometrial cancer. Increased dietary vitamin C has been linked to reduced risk of endometrial cancer.\nPopulation research has found that intake of vitamin C from dietary sources is associated with a slightly decreased risk of endometrial cancer when compared with control. However, this benefit is not observed when results from a prospective cohort study are assessed (34578).\nless\nEndometriosis. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with vitamin E; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with endometriosis and pelvic pain shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E 800 IU daily for 8 weeks improves dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain scores when compared with placebo. Vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation also reduces some biochemical markers of oxidative stress when compared with placebo (106622). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4 other, mostly small clinical studies in patients with endometriosis shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E 800-1200 IU daily for 6-8 weeks reduces chronic pelvic pain and improves dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia when compared with placebo (114491).\nless\nEndoscopy-associated adverse effects. It is unclear if a topical vitamin C spray reduces mucosal irritation in patients undergoing Lugol chromoendoscopy.\nA small clinical trial in patients receiving a Lugol chromoendoscopy shows that spraying a vitamin C 2% solution after the application of the Lugol iodine 2% solution reduces the severity of mucosal irritation, heartburn, and pain when compared with using a normal saline spray after the Lugol iodine 2% solution (104030).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with reduced odds of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A 50 gram increase in dietary vitamin C intake is associated with a 13% reduced odds of esophageal cancer (34551, 98770). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking a vitamin C supplement in combination with beta-carotene and vitamin E does not reduce the risk of esophageal cancer (34581).\nless\nExercise-induced asthma. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin C may modestly improve symptoms in patients with exercise-induced asthma.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that vitamin C supplementation might reduce exercise-induced breathlessness when compared with placebo or control. However, the available research is of poor quality, and no clear conclusions can be drawn regarding its benefits for exercise-induced asthma (90409).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA small clinical study in healthy females shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg before moderate intensity cycling does not prevent muscle damage when compared with placebo (99837). Another small clinical study in endurance-trained runners shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) 235 mg 2 hours prior to an exercise protocol does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness or improve other markers of exercise-induced muscle damage when compared with placebo (109961).\nless\nGallbladder disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin C reduces the risk of gallbladder disease.\nCross-sectional epidemiological evidence has found that vitamin C supplementation and increased vitamin C serum levels are associated with a decreased risk of developing gallbladder disease in females, but not males (5877).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if dietary or supplemental vitamin C reduces the risk of gastric cancer.\nMost population research has not found an association between DIETARY intake of vitamin C and gastric cancer risk (9194, 10822, 10819, 90083). Also, clinical research shows that taking vitamin C supplements in combination with other antioxidants does not reduce the risk of gastric cancer or precancerous gastric lesions (14447, 34581, 90085). However, some research suggests that it might be associated with a reduced risk for specific forms of gastric cancer (9838, 90083). One clinical study shows that taking vitamin C orally 500 mg daily for 6 months after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection decreases the incidence of precancerous changes in stomach tissue when compared with no treatment (10359). Also, other clinical research shows that taking vitamin C orally 1 gram daily helps promote the regression of precancerous gastric lesions in people at high risk for gastric cancer (2579). In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that vitamin C supplements may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. However, the FDA has concluded that it is highly uncertain that vitamin C supplements actually reduce the risk of gastric cancer (102332).\nless\nGastritis. There is limited evidence on the oral use of vitamin C in omeprazole-induced corpus gastritis.\nA small clinical study shows that taking vitamin C orally 1200 mg daily along with omeprazole decreases corpus gastritis associated with omeprazole therapy in patients with H. pylori infection (10360).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial for gingivitis.\nA small clinical study in adults with gingivitis shows that rinsing with a vitamin C and chlorhexidine mouthwash 15 mL for 60 seconds twice daily for 14 days does not improve severity of plaque, gingivitis, or bleeding on probing when compared with chlorhexidine alone or with phenol (116124). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Also, the validity of this study may be limited by the short duration of follow-up.\nless\nGout. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to prevent or manage gout.\nPopulation research in men has found that taking vitamin C 500-1500 mg daily from the diet and/or supplements is associated with up to a 34% reduced risk of gout when compared with less than 250 mg daily (16755). Also, men who ingest over 500 mg of vitamin C daily from the diet and supplements have serum uric acid levels that are slightly lower than men who consume less than 90 mg daily (16820). However, taking supplemental vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks does not seem to lower serum uric acid levels in patients who already have gout (90423).\nless\nHearing loss. There is limited evidence on the intravenous use of vitamin C in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C intake can affect the risk of hearing loss.\nA small clinical study in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss shows that receiving intravenous high-dose vitamin C 200 mg/kg daily in combination with steroid therapy for 10 days, followed by oral vitamin C 2000 mg daily for 30 days, increases recovery rate two-fold and modestly improves hearing threshold levels when compared with receiving steroid therapy only (90417).\n\nIn addition, population research in females has found that high dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a 22% increased risk of developing self-reported hearing loss over a 22-year period when compared with low intake (109807).\nless\nHeart transplant complications. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that a combination of vitamin C 500 mg and vitamin E 400 IU, taken twice daily for 1 year starting within the first 2 years after cardiac transplant, reduced the progression of vasculopathy as measured by intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) when compared with placebo. This suggests that the combination may help slow the progression of CAV (82826).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in patients with hepatitis C.\nA small clinical study in patients with confirmed hepatitis C shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg daily with conventional therapy (sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir) for 4 weeks improves serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and albumin when compared with conventional therapy alone (109463).\nless\nHIV transmission. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in HIV-positive mothers shows that taking vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin E daily during pregnancy and while breast-feeding for 20 weeks seems to reduce child mortality and HIV transmission through breast milk when compared with taking vitamin A (9801).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, low-quality study in men with HIV shows that taking vitamin C 250 mg daily in combination with vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin E, selenium, and coenzyme Q10 does not improve viral load, although it seems to improve markers of oxidative stress when compared to baseline. However, a 1000 mg dose of vitamin C, as well as higher doses of the other antioxidants, do not seem to provide any additional effect (9830).\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. Intravenous vitamin C might be beneficial for reducing phosphate levels in patients with end-stage renal disease.\nA small clinical study in hemodialysis patients with elevated phosphorus levels suggests that administering vitamin C 500 mg intravenously three times weekly for 8 weeks reduces phosphorus levels about seven-fold when compared with placebo (90414).\nless\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, shows that taking a combination of vitamin C 250 mg every other day, vitamin D 50,000 IU daily, and vitamin E 200 IU daily for 12 weeks improves some, but not all, measures of lung function and reduces markers of inflammation and oxidative stress when compared to baseline (109464). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control group.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in anovulatory females.\nA very small clinical study suggests that taking vitamin C 400-1000 mg daily might improve fertility, resulting in ovulation and pregnancy in some anovulatory females, when compared to baseline (14018). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group. However, a very large observational study suggests that there is no association between dietary vitamin C intake and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes including good oocyte quality, embryo transfer success rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and successful term pregnancy rates in subfertile couples who are candidates for IVF (112097).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin C is beneficial in males with infertility.\nA meta-analysis of three small, low-quality clinical trials in males with infertility shows that taking vitamin C up to 1000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks can improve sperm count, motility, and vitality, but does not seem to increase semen volume or sperm concentration, when compared with control (109461). It is unclear if vitamin C can increase pregnancy rates, as these studies did not assess this outcome.\n\nA retrospective study in males with or without varicocele-related infertility has found that taking a specific combination product containing vitamin C 90 mg, zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine fumarate 1725 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg, coenzyme Q10 20 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, selenium 0.05 mg, and vitamin B12 0.015 mg (Proxeed Plus, Sigma-Tau) orally twice daily for 6 months improves sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility when compared with baseline. Improvement in semen parameters were greatest in subjects with more severe varicoceles. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (111296).\nless\nMastalgia. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mastalgia shows that taking a combination of vitamin C 100 mg, vitamin B12, and gamma-linolenic acid daily for 12 weeks does not improve the proportion of patients with minimal or no pain when compared with placebo (111059).\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if topical vitamin C is beneficial in patients with melasma.\nA small clinical study in patients with bilateral symmetrically distributed facial melasma shows that applying 0.5 mL of vitamin C (Cosmotech, Alpha Medical Cosmotech) following dermapen microneedling every 2 weeks for 6 weeks is similarly effective to tranexamic acid for improving melasma severity and pigmented, but not vascular, findings on dermoscopic examination (106939). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with melasma shows that applying 1 to 2 mL of 20% vitamin C solution following dermapen microneedling every 2 weeks for 8 weeks does not improve the degree of pigmentation when compared with topical metformin but does improve the degree of pigmentation when compared to baseline (115610).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nA clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin C 250 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some biochemical markers of liver health and glucose metabolism when compared with baseline. However, the improvement from baseline was similar between groups (106942).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests vitamin C in combination with vitamin E might improve hepatic fibrosis in patients with NASH. However, it does not seem to decrease liver inflammation (14005).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin C reduces the risk of developing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nIn one population study, higher dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C was associated with a reduced risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, when compared with lower intake in postmenopausal adults (90945).\nless\nOral cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin C reduces the risk of developing oral cancer.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a reduced risk of oral cancer (10821). However, clinical research has not shown benefit with oral vitamin C supplements. A small clinical trial in Japanese adults with oral leukoplakia shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg and beta-carotene 10 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce the development of oral cancer over 5 years when compared with vitamin C 50 mg daily (91384).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in Japanese adults with oral leukoplakia shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg and beta-carotene 10 mg daily for 12 months does not improve leukoplakia symptoms or reduce the development of oral cancer over 5 years when compared with vitamin C 50 mg daily (91384).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C reduces the risk of developing osteoarthritis.\nObservational research has found that increased vitamin C from dietary sources is associated with a reduced risk of cartilage loss and disease progression in people with osteoarthritis (5881).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if dietary vitamin C improves bone density or reduces fracture risk in patients at risk for osteoporosis.\nSome cross-sectional observational research in postmenopausal patients without a history of smoking or estrogen use has found that higher serum vitamin C levels are associated with lower bone mineral density (9828). However, other observational research in a larger population of adults at risk for osteoporosis has found that higher dietary vitamin C intake is not associated with fracture risk (104415).\nless\nOvarian cancer. Dietary vitamin C might not affect the risk of ovarian cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that dietary vitamin C intake is not linked with ovarian cancer risk (9193, 102977).\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if vitamin C is beneficial for acute pain.\nA small clinical study in adults treated in the emergency department for acute musculoskeletal pain shows that taking vitamin C 1 gram twice daily for 14 days does not reduce pain when compared with placebo (116122). However, findings are limited by differences in analgesic usage between the two groups.\nless\nPancreatitis. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C is beneficial in patients with acute pancreatitis.\nA small meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with acute pancreatitis shows that intravenous vitamin C does not improve the odds of developing organ failure when compared with placebo or no intervention. Intravenous vitamin C seems to reduce hospital stay, but not in-hospital mortality (106941).\nless\nParkinson disease. Dietary vitamin C might not affect the risk of developing this condition.\nObservational research has found that moderate or high dietary intake of vitamin C is not associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson disease (83316).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is also unclear if dietary vitamin C reduces the risk of periodontitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing vitamin C 100 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo (111708). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin C, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nThere is also interest in whether dietary vitamin C intake impacts the risk of periodontitis. Observational research in US adults has found that individuals with dietary intake of vitamin C in the third quartile, but not the second or fourth quartiles, have lower odds of periodontitis when compared with vitamin C intake in the lowest quartile. Furthermore, the investigators identified a non-linear relationship between vitamin C intake and periodontitis risk, suggesting that individuals with intakes either much lower or much higher than 158 mg daily are at increased risk of developing periodontitis (109958).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if dietary vitamin C helps to reduce the risk of developing PAD.\nIn females, epidemiological evidence has found that dietary intake of vitamin C of 142 mg daily or greater is associated with a 36% reduced risk of PAD when compared with lower intake levels of less than 80 mg daily (10130).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to improve physical performance and muscle strength in older people.\nPopulation research has found that higher intake of dietary vitamin C is associated with improved physical performance and muscle strength in elderly people (14006). In contrast, a small clinical study in elderly men undergoing strength training shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E 258IU daily for 12 weeks does not increase strength, and might even attenuate increases in muscle mass, when compared with strength training alone (96701).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin C helps to prevent or treat pneumonia.\nA meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies in adults with community-acquired pneumonia shows that oral or intravenous vitamin C does not reduce overall mortality, hospital or intensive care unit length of stay, or the risk of mechanical ventilation when compared with control (114490). The interpretation of these results is limited by significant heterogeneity of the included studies. An earlier meta-analysis of two small, low-quality clinical studies in children shows that vitamin C does not seem to reduce the risk of pneumonia when compared with a control (104033).\nless\nPostoperative pulmonary complications. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C improves postoperative pulmonary complications.\nA large, single-blind clinical study in patients with recent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation shows that parenteral administration of vitamin C 50 mg/kg intraoperatively and 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for the next 48 hours, followed by oral vitamin C 2000 mg daily until 1-week post-discharge, reduces the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) by 22% and improves PPC severity scores when compared with control. Specifically, vitamin C reduces the incidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and re-intubation and may ameliorate lung damage as suggested by higher Horowitz index when compared with control (114492). A small clinical trial in patients undergoing low-risk cardiac surgery shows that receiving intravenous vitamin C 1 gram 10 minutes after anesthesia might slightly reduce the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications when compared with receiving a saline injection (104034).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin C improves postoperative recovery.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that oral or intravenous vitamin C can shorten the duration of hospitalization after cardiac surgery when compared with control (91233, 96703). However, other research shows no decrease in intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay with vitamin C supplementation (96705), while another clinical study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation shows that intravenous vitamin C administered during surgery and 48 hours after surgery reduces ICU stay and re-admission rates, wound infection, and hospital mortality, but not length of hospital stay, when compared with control (114492). A meta-analysis of 37 clinical trials in adults undergoing low- to high-risk noncardiac surgery (i.e., orthopedic, abdominal, gynecologic, or kidney transplantation), shows that receiving perioperative vitamin C, either orally or intravenously, does not improve duration of hospitalization or overall mortality when compared with control (108087).\nless\nPostoperative swelling. It is unclear if vitamin C reduces postoperative swelling after dental surgery.\nA small observational study in adults undergoing surgery for wisdom tooth extraction shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg three times daily for 7 days in addition to standard treatment reduces swelling 7 days after surgery when compared with control. However, vitamin C does not seem to reduce swelling 3 days after surgery when compared with control, suggesting that longer durations are needed for anti-inflammatory effects (113664).\nless\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM). Oral vitamin C seems to reduce the risk of PROM in some patients; however, the addition of oral vitamin E seems to negate any benefit.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin C alone decreases the risk of both term and preterm PROM by 45% and 34%, respectively, when compared with placebo or control (96707). Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin C during pregnancy decreases the risk of PROM by 43% and preterm PROM by 33%, but does not decrease the risk of term PROM, when compared with a control. While vitamin C was studied in doses of 100, 500, and 1000 mg daily, the decreased risk of PROM was only observed in studies of 100 mg daily (114493). A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with a history of PROM shows that taking vitamin C 100 mg daily, starting at 14 weeks' gestation, increases the gestational age at recurrent PROM by around 1 week and increases the gestational age at birth by around 1.3 weeks when compared with placebo (109960). Additionally, a meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that vitamin C levels in the blood tend to be lower in patients with PROM, particularly preterm PROM (114493).\n\nAlthough some individual clinical research disagrees (90078), taking vitamin C in combination with vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of term or preterm PROM (83472, 96707, 117199). A meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies in nearly 5600 adults shows that taking a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of PROM when compared with placebo (117199). Also, some research suggests that it might even increase the risk of non-preterm PROM (96707).\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if oral vitamin C, when used alone or in combination with other ingredients, can improve the healing of pressure ulcers.\nA small clinical study in institutionalized patients with pressure ulcers shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve wound closure or increase healing rates when compared with vitamin C 10 mg twice daily (83617).\n\nOral vitamin C has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients with pressure ulcers shows that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with vitamin C, L-arginine, and zinc improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet (31953, 87173). Also, clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, vitamin C, L-arginine, and zinc daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline (32045). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRadiation proctopathy. Oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with vitamin E; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic radiation proctitis shows that vitamin C 500 mg plus vitamin E 400 IU three times daily might improve symptoms when compared with baseline (9825). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if increased dietary intake of vitamin C helps to reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma.\nPopulation research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a 12% reduced risk of renal cell carcinoma (98779).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial for preventing respiratory tract infections or reducing the duration of these infections.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children and adults shows that, when compared with placebo, oral vitamin C supplementation reduces the average number of symptomatic days per individual, but does not reduce the average symptom days per respiratory episode. Also, vitamin C intake does not reduce the incidence or severity of respiratory disease or improve recovery in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections (108077). The validity of this trial is limited by the high heterogeneity of included studies, which evaluated various vitamin C regimens, ranging from 100 mg to 8 grams daily, as preventive therapy or as an adjuvant to active treatment.\n\nA clinical study in children aged 3-10 years shows that taking vitamin C 50 mg in combination with a specific product (Lab4) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis daily for 6 months reduces the incidence of cough and sore throat by 16% and 20%, respectively, when compared with placebo. However, it did not improve total symptoms, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, or sneezing. Also, aside from a 33% reduction in the average number of days with a sore throat, daily supplementation does not reduce the duration of individual symptoms or total symptoms (106943). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin C, the probiotics, or the combination.\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to reduce symptoms of stress.\nA small clinical study in hemodialysis patients with RLS shows that taking vitamin C 200 mg daily, alone or in combination with vitamin E 400 mg, for 8 weeks reduces the severity of RLS when compared with placebo (90093). More research is needed to determine if vitamin C is beneficial in treating RLS that is not associated with hemodialysis.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral vitamin C helps to reduce symptoms of stress.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking vitamin C 3000 mg daily for 14 days modestly reduces blood pressure and subjective stress response to psychological stress when compared with placebo (10353).\nless\nStroke. Observational research has found that although taking vitamin C supplements does not seem to be beneficial, eating more vitamin C-rich food is linked with reduced risk of stroke.\nLower plasma levels of vitamin C have been associated with increased stroke risk (90408). Additionally, population research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin C is associated with a 8% to 19% reduction in stroke risk when compared to lower intake (90408, 109779). This reduction appears to be dose-dependent, with each 100 mg/day increase in dietary vitamin C intake associated with about a 17% reduction (90408). However, taking vitamin C supplements has not been found to be associated with reduced stroke risk (1449, 90408).\nless\nSunburn. Topical and oral vitamin C has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTaking vitamin C orally in combination with vitamin E seems to prevent ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced erythema (sunburn) (4715, 4716). Vitamin C in combination with high dose oral RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) seems to protect against skin inflammation after exposure to UV radiation (4715). Also, applying topical vitamin C in combination with topical vitamin E and melatonin seems to provide modest photoprotective effects when used prior to UV exposure. However, it has no effect when used during or after UV exposure (4713, 4714).\nless\nTetanus. It is unclear if intravenous vitamin C helps to reduce symptoms of tetanus.\nA low quality clinical trial in children and young adults with tetanus shows that intravenous vitamin C 1 gram daily along with conventional treatment reduces fatality when compared to control (21539).\nless\nTooth extraction. It is unclear if oral vitamin C is beneficial for reducing pain or improving healing after tooth extraction.\nA small clinical study in healthy patients aged 14-41 years who are undergoing bilateral premolar extraction shows that taking vitamin C 200 mg three times daily, beginning immediately after extraction and continued for 10 days, improves pain on days 1-3, and may reduce mesio-distal wound size between days 1 and 7, when compared with placebo, but not when compared with vitamin C 500 mg three times daily. A dose of 500 mg three times daily did not improve pain scores or extraction wound healing when compared with placebo (108084). The validity of this trial is limited by the short duration of treatment; additionally, this study did not report baseline vitamin C levels.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin C for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin C for this condition.\nVascular dementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin C reduces the risk of vascular dementia.\nPopulation research has found that supplemental intake of vitamin C and vitamin E is associated with a reduced risk of vascular dementia in Japanese-American men (4636). However, when cases in which dementia was diagnosed prior to the study are excluded from data analysis, intake of vitamin C and vitamin E is not associated with a reduced risk of vascular dementia in these patients (9824).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral vitamin C improves the healing of chronic foot ulcers. It is also unclear if intravenous vitamin C improves healing of surgical wounds after total abdominal hysterectomy.\nA very small clinical study in adults with chronic foot ulcers shows that taking slow-release vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to result in a median of 100% ulcer healing, compared with a median of 14% ulcer healing in patients taking glucosamine 1000 mg daily (105456). This finding is limited due to the small and heterogeneous patient population, which included patients with diabetes, vascular disease, and/or vitamin C deficiency.\n\nAnother small clinical study in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy shows that administration of intravenous vitamin C 1 gram the night before surgery and 1 gram during surgery does not reduce the rate of surgical site infection or wound dehiscence when compared with placebo (109465). However, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin C for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nThe daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin C are 90 mg for males and 75 mg for females aged 19 years and older. During pregnancy the RDA is 85 mg daily for 19-50 years of age and 80 mg daily for 14-18 years of age. During lactation, the RDA is 120 mg daily for 19-50 years of age and 115 mg daily for ages 14-18 years of age. People who use tobacco should take an additional 35 mg per day (4844).\n\nVitamin C supplements have been used in doses of up to 2000 mg daily, which is the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults aged 19 years and older. Vitamin C has been used most often in doses of 400-1000 mg daily for up to 6 months (1959, 4713, 4714, 4844). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous:\nVitamin C 50 mg/kg, or 2-3 grams, daily has been used. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nVitamin C has been used in various topical formulations, including as a liquid, lotion, serum, spray, and patch. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nThe Adequate Intake (AI) of vitamin C for infants 0-6 months is 40 mg daily and for infants 7-12 months is 50 mg daily. The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin C are as follows:; 1-3 years, 15 mg; 4-8 years, 25 mg; 9-13 years, 45 mg; 14-18 years, 75 mg for males and 65 mg for females. The ULs for vitamin C are as follows: 1-3 years, 400 mg daily; 4-8 years, 650 mg; 9-13 years, 1200 mg; and 14-18 years, including during pregnancy and lactation, 1800 mg (4844).\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn some trials, vitamin C has been administered as a slow-release formulation (1918, 89234). The slow-release formulation has been shown to decrease fluctuations in plasma concentrations of vitamin C following oral intake compared to plain formulations (90935).",

Ascorbic acid competitively inhibits sulfate conjugation of acetaminophen. However, to compensate, elimination of acetaminophen glucuronide and unconjugated acetaminophen increases (6451). This effect is not likely to be clinically significant.\nless\nALKYLATING AGENTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, antioxidant effects of vitamin C might reduce the effectiveness of alkylating agents.\nThe use of antioxidants like vitamin C during chemotherapy is controversial. There is concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, and thiotepa (391). In contrast, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin C have on chemotherapy.\nless\nALUMINUM\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nVitamin C can increase the amount of aluminum absorbed from aluminum compounds.\nResearch in animals and humans shows that vitamin C increases aluminum absorption, theoretically by chelating aluminum and keeping it in solution where it is available for absorption (10549, 10550, 10551, 21556). In people with normal renal function, urinary excretion of aluminum will likely increase, making aluminum retention and toxicity unlikely (10549). Patients with renal failure who take aluminum-containing compounds such as phosphate binders should avoid vitamin C supplements in doses above the recommended dietary allowances.\nless\nANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, the antioxidant effects of vitamin C might reduce the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics.\nThe use of antioxidants like vitamin C during chemotherapy is controversial. There is concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs which generate free radicals, such as doxorubicin (391). In contrast, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013).

However, short-term use of up to 6 grams daily of vitamin C does not seem to affect urinary pH or salicylate excretion (10588, 10589), suggesting this interaction is not clinically significant.\nless\nCHOLINE MAGNESIUM TRISALICYLATE (Trilisate)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nAcidification of the urine by vitamin C might increase choline magnesium trisalicylate levels.\nIt has been suggested that acidification of the urine by vitamin C could increase reabsorption of salicylates by the renal tubules, and increase plasma salicylate levels (3046, 4531). However, short-term use of up to 6 grams daily of vitamin C does not seem to affect urinary pH or salicylate excretion (10588, 10589), suggesting this interaction probably is not clinically significant.\nless\nESTROGENS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nVitamin C might increase blood levels of estrogens.\nIncreases in plasma estrogen levels of up to 55% occur under some circumstances when vitamin C is taken concurrently with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, including topical products (129, 130, 11161). It is suggested that vitamin C prevents oxidation of estrogen in the tissues, regenerates oxidized estrogen, and reduces sulfate conjugation of estrogen in the gut wall (129, 11161). When tissue levels of vitamin C are high, these processes are already maximized and supplemental vitamin C does not have any effect on estrogen levels. Increases in plasma estrogen levels may occur when patients who are deficient in vitamin C take supplements (11161). Monitor these patients for estrogen-related side effects.\nless\nFLUPHENAZINE (Prolixin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, vitamin C might decrease levels of fluphenazine.\nIn one patient there was a clinically significant decrease in fluphenazine levels when vitamin C (500 mg twice daily) was started (11017). The mechanism is not known, and there is no further data to confirm this interaction.\nless\nINDINAVIR (Crixivan)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nVitamin C can modestly reduce indinavir levels.\nOne pharmacokinetic study shows that taking vitamin C 1 gram orally once daily along with indinavir 800 mg orally three times daily reduces the area under the concentration-time curve of indinavir by 14%. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown, but it is unlikely to be clinically significant in most patients. The effect of higher doses of vitamin C on indinavir levels is unknown (11300, 93578).\nless\nLEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nVitamin C can increase levothyroxine absorption.\nTwo clinical studies in adults with poorly controlled hypothyroidism show that swallowing levothyroxine with a glass of water containing vitamin C 500-1000 mg in solution reduces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and increases thyroxine (T4) levels when compared with taking levothyroxine alone. This suggests that vitamin C increases the oral absorption of levothyroxine, possibly due to a reduction in pH (102978).\nless\nNIACIN\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nVitamin C might decrease the beneficial effects of niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.\nA combination of niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) effectively raises HDL cholesterol levels in patients with coronary disease and low HDL levels. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium) along with niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) attenuates this rise in HDL, specifically the HDL-2 and apolipoprotein A1 fractions, by more than 50% in patients with coronary disease (7388, 11537). It is not known whether this adverse effect is due to a single antioxidant such as vitamin C, or to the combination. It also is not known whether it will occur in other patient populations.\nless\nSALSALATE (Disalcid)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nINSIGNIFICANT\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nAcidification of the urine by vitamin C might increase salsalate levels.\nIt has been suggested that acidification of the urine by vitamin C could increase reabsorption of salicylates by the renal tubules, and increase plasma salicylate levels (3046). However, short-term use of up to 6 grams/day vitamin C does not seem to affect urinary pH or salicylate excretion (10588, 10589), suggesting this interaction probably is not clinically significant.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nHigh-dose vitamin C might reduce the levels and effectiveness of warfarin.\nVitamin C in high doses may cause diarrhea and possibly reduce warfarin absorption (11566). There are reports of two people who took up to 16 grams daily of vitamin C and had a reduction in prothrombin time (9804, 9806). Lower doses of 5-10 grams daily can also reduce warfarin absorption. In many cases, this does not seem to be clinically significant (9805, 9806, 11566, 11567). However, a case of warfarin resistance has been reported for a patient who took vitamin C 500 mg twice daily. Cessation of vitamin C supplementation resulted in a rapid increase in international normalized ratio (INR) (90942). Tell patients taking warfarin to avoid taking vitamin C in excessively high doses (greater than 10 grams daily). Lower doses may be safe, but the anticoagulation activity of warfarin should be monitored. Patients who are stabilized on warfarin while taking vitamin C should avoid adjusting vitamin C dosage to prevent the possibility of warfarin resistance.\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nACEROLA\nAcerola contains high concentrations of vitamin C.\nAcerola contains an average of 2000 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams of fruit (30260). Concomitant use of acerola with vitamin C supplements might exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg vitamin C per day for adults (4844, 12651, 21557). This could increase the risk for adverse effects.\nless\nCHROMIUM\nLimited data suggests that vitamin C increases chromium absorption.\nThe amount of chromium absorbed from a 1000 mcg dose approximately doubled when taken along with vitamin C 100 mg (10600). Advise people to avoid taking large doses of chromium and vitamin C together. It is not known whether separating the doses by several hours avoids this interaction.\nless\nCOPPER\nHigh doses of vitamin C might interfere with copper absorption.\nLow doses of vitamin C do not seem to affect copper absorption or retention (21562); however, high doses of vitamin C (1500 mg daily) can decrease serum levels of copper and the copper transport protein, ceruloplasmin, in young men. The acidity of vitamin C may convert copper in the gut to a less absorbable form, and vitamin C may directly interfere with transport of copper across the intestinal wall. It is also suggested that vitamin C can stimulate tissue copper utilization (710, 11538). It is unlikely that this interaction is clinically significant unless dietary copper intake is low (710).\nless\nGRAPE\nVitamin C taken with grape seed polyphenols might increase blood pressure.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg/day in combination with grape seed polyphenols 1000 mg/day significantly increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with hypertension (13162). The potential mechanism of this interaction is not known.\nless\nIRON\nSupplemental and dietary vitamin C can increase the absorption of iron.\nSupplemental or dietary vitamin C improves absorption of dietary non-heme iron when ingested at the same time (9518, 9571, 9586, 11571, 21563, 83168, 83661). Also, the amount of vitamin C in the diet is a factor in dietary iron absorption and iron status (9570, 9572). Vitamin C can counteract the effects of dietary substances which inhibit iron absorption, such as phytates, polyphenols, and tannins, possibly by chemically reducing iron and preventing the formation of less soluble ferric compounds (9518, 9573, 9586, 11571). The effect of vitamin C on iron status seems to be greater in individuals with iron deficiency compared to those with sufficient iron levels (21502). However, some clinical research in patients with iron deficiency shows that taking iron with vitamin C is no better for improving hemoglobin levels when compared with taking iron alone (104680, 112477). Taking a vitamin C supplement to improve absorption of iron is probably not necessary for most people, especially if their diet contains plenty of vitamin C (9571).\nless\nROSE HIP\nRose hips contain high concentrations of vitamin C.\nConcomitant use of rose hip with vitamin C supplements might exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 2000 mg vitamin C per day for adults (12652). This could increase the risk for adverse effects.\nless\nVITAMIN B12\nDespite claims to the contrary, vitamin C does not seem to reduce levels of vitamin B12 in the body.\nHigh-dose vitamin C seems to degrade certain forms of vitamin B12 in solution and in test tubes. Although early clinical research suggested that vitamin C might also reduce serum vitamin B12 levels, this was later disproven. There appears to be no clinically significant change in serum vitamin B12 levels in patients taking as much as 4 grams of vitamin C daily (9511, 104078). Overall, it seems that high-dose vitamin C does not affect serum levels of vitamin B12.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nALCOHOL USE DISORDER\nAlcohol intake can increase urinary excretion of vitamin C by almost 50% (90941). In healthy patients, this increased excretion does not appear to significantly affect vitamin C status (90939). However, with chronic alcohol use, particularly in those who are acutely unwell or critically ill, vitamin C deficiency is common. In such patients, conventional intravenous supplementation with vitamin C (two to three times daily for 3 days) might be insufficient to restore vitamin C levels. Prolonged supplementation may be needed (90940).\nless\nCANCER\nCancerous cells accumulate high concentrations of vitamin C. Cancer cells take up the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid, then convert it back to vitamin C (4838, 4839, 4840, 4841). However, it is not yet known if supplemental vitamin C benefits the growth of cancer cells or has any detrimental effect on cancer treatments. Until more is known, patients with cancer should only use supplemental vitamin C under the direction of their oncologist.\nless\nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)\nCKD might lead to vitamin C deficiency. Kidney disease can also decrease the excretion of oxalate and increase the risk of oxalate nephropathy. Theoretically, supplemental vitamin C could increase the risk for hyperoxaluria. One observational study in children with CKD found that vitamin C supplementation did not affect oxalate levels (104026). However, in one case report, a bariatric surgery patient with CKD experienced acute kidney failure from secondary oxalosis that was attributed to intake of supplemental vitamin C 1000 mg daily (96710). Theoretically, intake of vitamin C supplements might increase the risk of hyperoxaluria in patients with concomitant kidney dysfunction, especially those who have undergone bariatric surgery.\nless\nGLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY\nLarge amounts of vitamin C can cause hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (15). In one case, a 9-month-old infant with G6PD deficiency presented with acute hemolytic anemia after being treated with intravenous vitamin C 2000 mg every 4 hours for two days (90937). In another case, a 3-year-old child presented with acute hemolytic anemia and acute kidney injury following accidental ingestion of vitamin C 300 mg (106944).\nless\nKIDNEY STONES (Nephrolithiasis)\nLarger amounts of vitamin C can increase the risk of oxalate kidney stones, especially in those prone to oxalate stone formation. Vitamin C is metabolized to oxalic acid, so increased consumption increases the urinary concentration of oxalic acid and the formation of oxalate kidney stones (10356). People who have a history of oxalate stones seem to be more sensitive to supplemental vitamin C than non-stone formers. In those with a history of oxalate kidney stones (the most common type of nephrolithiasis), supplemental vitamin C 1 gram per day appears to increase stone risk by 40% (12653). In males, daily supplemental vitamin C doses as low as 250 mg have been associated with a higher risk of kidney stones (104029). Tell patients prone to kidney stone formation to avoid higher doses of vitamin C.\nless\nNICOTINE AND SMOKING\nSmokers have lower plasma levels of vitamin C than nonsmokers with similar dietary intake of vitamin C (5875, 11501). The reason for these lower levels is unclear. There does not seem to be an effect of nicotine on vitamin C levels, and depletion has not been reported with nicotine replacement products (e.g., patches, gum, etc). Advise smokers to consume a diet rich in vitamin C, or recommend a supplement if this is not possible. Smokers may need between 124-200 mg daily to maintain normal plasma levels (11546).\nless\nSMOKELESS TOBACCO USE\nUsers of chewing tobacco tend to have lower plasma levels of vitamin C than non-users with similar dietary intakes (11501). This may increase the risk of precancerous oral lesions (11502). Advise tobacco users to consume a diet rich in vitamin C.\nless",

Large amounts of vitamin C can cause false increases in urine test results measured by copper reduction methods (e.g., Clinitest), and false decreases in results measured by glucose oxidase methods (e.g., Clinistix, Tes-Tape) (15). Also, large amounts of vitamin C can cause a falsely elevated blood glucose result when measured using self-monitoring blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices (90938, 104031, 117201, 117202, 117203). In one case, a patient with type 2 diabetes who had been taking vitamin C 10 grams daily for 10 days presented with a falsely elevated blood glucose level (90938). In another case report, a patient with lymphoma received intravenous vitamin C 1 gram/kg in 9 separate injections over 19 days, which resulted in falsely elevated glucometer measurements (104031). The user's guide of various CGM devices notes that vitamin C intakes of 500 mg or greater could result in falsely elevated glucose readings (117203). However, this interference may only occur with CGM devices that use electrochemical or enzyme based methods. In vitro research on CGM devices that use abiotic (non-enzyme based), fluorescent glucose-indicating polymer (hydrogel) based methods reported no interference (117201).\nless\nLACTIC DEHYDROGENASE (LDH)\nVitamin C can cause a false decrease in test results measured by Technicon SMA 12/60 and Abbott 100 methods (275).\nless\nOCCULT BLOOD\nFalse-negative guaiac results occur with vitamin C in doses of 250 mg or more daily (3042). Patients should avoid dietary or supplemental vitamin C for 3 days prior to guaiac fecal occult blood testing (21566, 21567).\nless\nTHEOPHYLLINE\nLarge amounts of vitamin C can cause a falsely low theophylline serum level when measured by the ARIS system or Ames Seralyzer photometer (275).\nless\nVITAMIN B12\nLarge amounts of vitamin C can interfere with vitamin B12 assay, resulting in falsely low vitamin B12 levels (1965).\nless",

In healthy patients, this increased excretion does not appear to significantly affect vitamin C status (90939). However, in chronic alcohol abusers, particularly those who are acutely unwell or critically ill, vitamin C deficiency is common and scurvy can occur (90940).\nless\nASPIRIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nAspirin might reduce levels of vitamin C.\nAspirin reduces tissue and leukocyte uptake of vitamin C, leaving more in the plasma to be filtered into the urine and increasing elimination (10590, 10591, 10592). It may also reduce absorption of vitamin C from the gut (11526, 11527). These effects are dose-related (10590, 11526). Vitamin C supplementation has been suggested for people taking high-dose aspirin long-term (10591). Supplements aren't needed with the low doses of aspirin used for cardiovascular indications.\nless\nCALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nDihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DCCBs) might decrease vitamin C absorption.\nDCCBs inhibit uptake of vitamin C by intestinal cells in vitro (9808). Whether this causes a clinically significant reduction in vitamin C absorption in humans is not known.\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nDiuretics might reduce levels of vitamin C.\nIn people with chronic renal failure, a 20 mg intravenous dose of furosemide (Lasix) increases urinary losses of vitamin C, probably due to increased water excretion (9525). Significant vitamin C depletion hasn't been reported with long-term oral use of furosemide or other diuretics.\nless\nESTROGENS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nEstrogens might reduce levels of vitamin C.\nEvidence on the effects of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy on vitamin C levels is conflicting (10548, 10583, 10585, 10586, 11528, 11875, 11876). It's suggested that estrogens can reduce vitamin C absorption or increase its breakdown, and that vitamin C stores are used to prevent oxidation of estrogens in tissue (10548, 10583, 10587, 11161, 11875). This may only be clinically relevant in patients with very low intake of vitamin C (10548, 11161, 11528). Supplements aren't necessary for people on estrogens who have an adequate dietary intake of vitamin C.\nless\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nPPIs might reduce vitamin C levels.\nPreliminary research suggests omeprazole reduces vitamin C levels, possibly due to increased destruction of vitamin C at higher gastric pH levels (10572). It is not known if this interaction results in clinically significant reductions in vitamin C levels.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with vitamin C.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nVitamin C is well absorbed orally at lower doses, but absorption decreases as the dose increases. Approximately 87% of a 30 mg oral dose is absorbed, 80% of a 100 mg dose is absorbed, 63 % of a 500 mg dose is absorbed, and less than 50% of a 1250 mg does is absorbed (9809). This is due to the fact that vitamin C is transported from the intestines into the blood by the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT1), which is saturable (83482). The decreased bioavailability of vitamin C with increased dosages, as increased renal excretion, limits the plasma levels attainable with oral vitamin C supplementation (9809). The plasma maximum observed concentration (Cmax) following administration of 500 mg of vitamin C or liposomal vitamin C (LipoVantage, Specnova, LLC) is about 6,271 ng/mL or 8,610 ng/mL, respectively, with a time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of 4 hours (115612).\nExcretion\nMost vitamin C that is absorbed is excreted in the urine (9809).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin C is a commonly used water-soluble vitamin and essential nutrient. Although many mammals can produce vitamin C, humans must obtain vitamin C from foods and other sources (1964, 4844). It's contained in high concentration in fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits. Vitamin C is labile, and the amount in foods can decrease significantly with cooking and storage (3042). Vitamin C has a role in several physiological functions. It is involved in tyrosine metabolism and is a cofactor in the synthesis of carnitine, thyroxin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and tryptophan (3042). Vitamin C is also involved in a variety of metabolic processes including oxidation-reduction reactions and cellular respiration, carbohydrate metabolism, synthesis of lipids and proteins, catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids, conversion of folic acid to folinic acid, and iron metabolism (5877). Vitamin C is probably best known for its effects as an antioxidant and its role in maintaining proper immune function (15). Normal plasma vitamin C levels typically exceed 0.3 mg/dL. When plasma levels exceed 1.4 mg/dL, excretion of vitamin C greatly increases (1965, 1969). Concentrations below 0.2 mg/dL indicate significant deficiency (1964). Vitamin C deficiency can cause fatigue, personality changes, and decline in psychomotor performance and motivation within 84 to 97 days. Some evidence suggests that subclinical vitamin C deficiency is more common in healthy people than generally recognized (9810). Since the nonspecific symptom of fatigue is often the first symptom of deficiency, vitamin C depletion may go undiagnosed (9809). Sustained vitamin C deficiency over 3 to 5 months results in symptomatic scurvy characterized by gingival swelling and bleeding, loosening of the teeth, hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhages, petechial hemorrhages in the viscera, and hemorrhages into the muscles of the arms, legs, and joints (1964). Severe scurvy may progress to neuritis, jaundice, fever, dyspnea, and death. In infants, vitamin C deficiency is initially manifested by listlessness, anorexia, irritability, and failure to thrive. Later symptoms result from hemorrhage and collagen deficiency, with seizures, shock, and death if left untreated (1965).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that is produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Some research suggests that taking vitamin C 515-2000 mg daily can reduce CRP levels in people who are actively or passively exposed to cigarette smoke or air pollution (14010, 109466). Vitamin C also seems to reduce other markers of inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in individuals exposed to air pollution (109466). However, vitamin C 50 or 500 mg daily for up to 5 years does not appear to reduce CRP levels in patients with atrophic gastritis (90405), though vitamin C administered intravenously during and 48 hours after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation does reduce CRP and sedimentation rate (114492).\nAnti-sepsis effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin C to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Observational research suggests that patients with septic shock are more likely to have low plasma levels of vitamin C and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than critically ill, non-septic patients (100317). Exploratory clinical research in patients with severe sepsis shows that intravenous administration of vitamin C reduces CRP and procalcitonin levels, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. It also attenuates an increase in thrombomodulin levels, possibly indicating a reduction in vascular endothelial injury (100318). Clinical research in patients with septic shock also suggests that intravenous vitamin C may increase levels of norepinephrine and precursors to endogenous norepinephrine synthesis such as tyrosine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. As a result, this might lower the dose of norepinephrine required during sepsis treatment (114489). Preclinical research also shows that vitamin C can prevent the cytokine surges in early sepsis that activate and sequester neutrophils in the lung and contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (102130). Laboratory research also suggests that vitamin C might alter cell membrane permeability in sepsis. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found in gram negative bacteria can cause cell membrane hyperpermeability. In vitro research shows that vitamin C with hydrocortisone reduces cell membrane permeability in LPS-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells; however, this effect was not seen with either vitamin C or hydrocortisone alone (100314). Furthermore, animal research shows that administering intravenous vitamin C reduces oxidative stress, attenuates a reduction in heart rate, and improves survival in septic mice that are predicted to have worsened outcomes based on physiological measurements. This effect was not seen in mice that were predicted to have better outcomes prior to vitamin C administration, suggesting that benefits of vitamin C might be limited to more severe cases of sepsis (100313).\nAntiallergic effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin C for allergies such as allergic rhinitis. Some evidence suggests that low vitamin C levels are associated with higher plasma histamine levels (10611). Theoretically, people with low vitamin C levels might have worse symptoms of allergic rhinitis. There is also some evidence that vitamin C might also have weak antihistamine properties (1969).\nAntihypertensive effects\nTaking vitamin C orally, in combination with antihypertensive drugs, seems to decrease systolic blood pressure in some patients (2044, 13162, 83444, 83483). Animal research suggests that vitamin C reduces blood pressure by increasing levels of the antioxidant glutathione, as well as improving insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (30859).\nAntioxidant effects\nPotentially beneficial effects of vitamin C are attributed primarily to antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects. Vitamin C readily undergoes reversible oxidation and reduction in the body (1963). Vitamin C decreases oxidants in gastric juice, decreases lipid peroxidation, and decreases oxidative DNA and protein damage (3042, 83215). Damage by reactive oxygen species is thought to be a contributing factor to a number of diseases including dementia, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and cancer. However, in a rat model of exercise under polluted conditions, administration of vitamin C only very modestly improved markers of oxidative stress (106940). Researchers theorize that antioxidants such as vitamin C might protect against some diseases associated with oxidative damage. For example, in hypertension, endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation, might be inhibited by superoxide anions. Vitamin C can scavenge the superoxide anions and theoretically help patients with hypertension. However, in this case there is some evidence that oral doses might not reach concentrations high enough for this effect (5879). Free oxygen radicals are also produced during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, causing plasma vitamin C to drop by 70% within 24 hours of surgery (102127).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn people with chronic heart failure, intra-arterial vitamin C seems to improve endothelial dysfunction and flow-dependent dilation of the arteries. Vitamin C appears to prevent inactivation of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation. Four weeks of oral vitamin C 1 gram twice daily appears to produce a similar effect (2434). In patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, vitamin C 2 grams daily seems to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation (14009). Vitamin C also seems to improve endothelial function and vascular resistance in patients with chronic renal failure (14014, 14017, 83222).\n\nThere's also some evidence that vitamin C might suppress the apoptosis (death) of endothelial cells of patients with congestive heart failure, but the clinical relevance of this isn't known (9816). Intracoronary infusion of vitamin C has been shown to enhance the inotropic response to dobutamine (Dobutrex), possibly by reducing oxidative stress caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the ventricle (2432). Some researchers think vitamin C might prevent or slow atherosclerosis by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; by impairing the products of reactive oxygen species from vascular cells; and by limiting the cellular responses to oxidized LDL, such as production of endothelium-derived NO (9812). There is some evidence that vitamin C reduces LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia (83445). In patients with coronary spastic angina, vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function when given by intravenous infusion as a single 2 gram dose (9819). Some research suggests that endothelial function may relate to insulin resistance in patients with hypertension. Single-dose intravenous vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function and restore insulin-mediated vasodilatation, but doesn't seem to improve glucose uptake (9820). Oral vitamin C seems to improve endothelial function in healthy young smokers, short term; the improvements in endothelial function diminish within 8 weeks, even though vitamin C levels remain elevated (9818).\n\nIn smokers, a single 3 gram dose given by intravenous infusion appears to restore coronary microcirculatory responsiveness and impaired coronary flow reserve induced by the oxidant effects of smoking. Vitamin C might reduce oxidative stress caused by the large number of oxidants in cigarette smoke (1956). Whether these effects are sustained when vitamin C is taken chronically is unknown. Pulmonary function is also positively related to dietary vitamin C intake in smokers and nonsmokers (2400).\n\nAnti-fibrillatory effects of vitamin C are possibly related to the prevention of oxidative byproducts in atrial tissue. Benefits do not seem to be directly electrophysiological (96705).\n\nA meta-analysis of cardiac and noncardiac patients, most of whom have normal cardiac function, shows that vitamin C may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with an average increase of 12% and 5% in cardiac and non-cardiac patients, respectively, when compared with either placebo or no treatment. It is unclear if route of administration may affect outcomes. Greater benefit was observed in patients with lower baseline LVEF levels (108074).\nChemotherapy-modulating effects\nSome researchers theorize that antioxidants, such as vitamin C, might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that could interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). However, vitamin C could also reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals (391). Preliminary data from a mouse lymphoma model indicate that vitamin C pretreatment reduces the efficacy of doxorubicin (16407). Leukemia and lymphoma cell culture studies also suggest that vitamin C pretreatment can reduce the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate, and imatinib. Since this list includes drugs which do not generate free radicals, mechanisms other than the antioxidant effects of vitamin C may be involved. This might include prevention of the mitochondrial membrane depolarization caused by many chemotherapy drugs, which is involved in regulating cell death (16407).\nDermatologic effects\nFree radicals are also generated in the skin by exposure to ultraviolet light and cause photo-aging. Vitamin C in the skin is believed to play a key role in neutralizing these free radicals and reducing UV skin damage. Topical application of vitamin C is thought to prevent skin damage when applied prior to UV exposure due to vitamin C's antioxidant effects (6062, 6155). Topical preparations are thought to help treat photo-aged and wrinkled skin due to vitamin C's antioxidant properties and by possibly by increasing collagen production and improving collagen organization (6155, 14008). Topical preparations containing 10% vitamin C might be most effective for increasing vitamin C concentrations in the skin. Because vitamin C is water soluble, oral supplementation of vitamin C might not produce high enough concentrations in the skin to treat photo-aged skin (6064, 6155). Topical application of vitamin C has been shown to increase collagen production and improve collagen organization (83421).\nErgogenic effects\nResearch in marathon runners suggests vitamin C might help post-race immune suppression. Vitamin C 1500 mg taken daily for 7 days before running seems to reduce post-exercise serum cortisol and cytokines (11961).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that supplementation with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 2 weeks can modulate the gut microbiota, leading to beneficial shifts in bacterial populations (106623).\nImmunostimulant effects\nBecause of vitamin C's role in maintaining normal immune function, a lot of people use it for treating and preventing infectious conditions such as the common cold. T-lymphocyte activity, phagocyte function, leukocyte mobility, and possibly antibody and interferon production seem to be increased by vitamin C (1963, 1965, 83560). Additionally, clinical research shows an increase in vitamin C levels in leukocytes after the administration of vitamin C and liposomal vitamin C (LipoVantage, Specnova, LLC) (115612). Some researchers think that vitamin C levels in white blood cells decrease at the onset of a cold and that boosting vitamin C intake might be beneficial (83214). There is some evidence vitamin C might have other effects in patients with the common cold. Vitamin C might protect normal tissues against reactive oxygen species that are produced by phagocytes during a viral infection. It might also enhance the proliferative responses of T-lymphocytes (1988). There is preliminary evidence vitamin C excretion might actually decrease during a cold, indicating that patients may retain vitamin C. However, absorption of vitamin C is unchanged during a cold (1986). Some researchers think vitamin C supplements might be useful to prevent other respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but there are no reliable clinical studies to support this hypothesis (14015).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nSince vitamin C is a cofactor in the synthesis of collagen, there is interest in its effects for tendon healing. A preliminary clinical study in adults after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair shows that taking vitamin C 500 mg daily for 45 days does not improve postoperative outcomes when compared with no supplementation. However, there was a non-significant trend to an increased healing rate (radiographically measured) in the vitamin C group (105460). This study was limited by a lack of placebo control and inappropriate randomization.\nRadiotherapy effects\nFor radiation-induced oral mucositis, the reduced form of vitamin C might be beneficial due to its antioxidant effect and role in maintaining connective tissue integrity (6103). Vitamin C may also reduce toxicity of reactive oxygen during radio-immunotherapy due to its antioxidant effects (5878).\n\nHowever, there is some concern that vitamin C might reduce the efficacy of radiotherapy. In vitro research suggests that pretreatment with vitamin C prior to irradiation might enhance breast cancer proliferation and reduce radiosensitivity, although these effects appear to depend on cancer type. Human epidermal growth factor 2-positive cells appeared to be more sensitive to vitamin C when compared with triple-negative or estrogen receptor-positive cells. An observational study in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy did not find an association between vitamin C supplementation and risk of breast cancer recurrence over a period of 5 years. However, even though the vitamin C group had notably less aggressive tumor types, recurrence-free survival was similar in both vitamin C and control groups (108082).\nUricosuric effect\nVitamin C is used for gout because it is thought to have a uricosuric effect and lower serum levels of uric acid. Some research shows that healthy subjects who take vitamin C 4 grams have uric acid clearance increased by over 200% within 2-6 hours. Vitamin C might compete with uric acid for renal reabsorption via the proximal tubules (16755, 16756, 16757, 16758, 16759). A meta-analysis in a heterogenous population shows that oral vitamin C supplementation at doses of 200-2000 mg daily for 14 days to 6 months is associated with reduced serum levels of uric acid. The effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on serum levels of uric acid is greater in patients younger than 65 years, at durations less than 1 month, and when used alone (106619)."

    "Vitamin D": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin D is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. There are several forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Both ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are metabolized in the body to calcitriol, the active metabolite (7555, 16890). Commercially available vitamin D3 supplements are usually made from animal sources such as lanolin, though a vegan source of D3 made from lichen is available. Vitamin D2 supplements are primarily plant-based (114502). Vitamin D is found in dietary sources, such as fish, eggs, and fortified milk (7555). It is also made in the skin during brief exposure to sunlight (11935). In the US, foods containing at least 120 IU vitamin D are allowed to state that \"adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a well-balanced diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" (11940, 97001).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Some experts suggest taking vitamin D 2000 IU (50 mcg) daily to reduce the risk for vitamin D deficiency, which has been associated with an increased risk for COVID-19. More recently, a joint task force has recommended 400-1000 IU (10-25 mcg) daily for those who are unable to spend 15-30 minutes in the sun each day. These doses are likely safe for most adults. Ensure that patients considering vitamin D for COVID-19 prevention follow healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods as well.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally or intramuscularly and appropriately. Vitamin D has been safely used in a wide range of doses (7555, 16888, 16891, 17476, 95913, 98186, 104619, 105209, 109040, 109059)(115580, 115590). When used orally long-term, doses should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for adults (17506, 99773); however, much higher doses such as 50,000 IU (1250 mcg) weekly orally for 6-12 weeks are often needed for the short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency (16891, 17476, 115590). Monthly oral doses of up to 60,000 IU (1500 mcg) have also been safely used for up to 5 years (105726). Toxicity usually does not occur until plasma levels exceed 150 ng/mL (17476).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses, long-term. Taking doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for adults for long periods can increase the risk of hypercalcemia (17506); however, much higher doses are often needed for short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Toxicity typically occurs when levels exceed 150 ng/mL (17476).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. When used long-term, doses should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily for those 0-6 months of age, 1500 IU (37.5 mcg) daily for those 6-12 months of age, 2500 IU (62.5 mcg) daily for those 1-3 years of age, 3000 IU (75 mcg) daily for those 4-8 years of age, and 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for those 9 years and older (17506); however, much higher doses are often needed for the short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Some research shows that giving vitamin D 14,000 IU (350 mcg) weekly for a year in children aged 10-17 years is safe (16875). A meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily in those up to a year of age and greater than 2000 IU (50 mcg) daily in those aged 1-6 years does not increase the risk of serious adverse events (108424).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses for longer than one year. Taking doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) long-term can increase the risk of hypercalcemia (17506).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin D is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily (17506, 95910).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily. Hypercalcemia during pregnancy due to excessive vitamin D intake can lead to several fetal adverse effects, including suppression of parathyroid hormone, hypocalcemia, tetany, seizures, aortic valve stenosis, retinopathy, and mental and/or physical developmental delay (17506).\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin D is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily (17506).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts.

Rarely, people develop hypertension (10142). An analysis of clinical research suggests that, when taken orally, vitamin D might modestly increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. However, it is not clear if this increase is clinically significant (84642).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, vitamin D may cause dry mouth. In clinical research, intake of vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 4 weeks followed by 50,000 IU monthly for 5 months thereafter was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in reports of dry mouth compared with placebo (91348).Vitamin D intoxication can occur when vitamin D supplements are taken orally in excessive doses.

Symptoms of renal impairment include frequency, nighttime awakening to urinate, thirst, inability to concentrate urine, and proteinuria. Renal impairment is usually reversible with discontinuation of vitamin D supplements (10142, 93002, 93943, 110831, 110833).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nFamilial hypophosphatemia. Oral vitamin D in combination with phosphate is effective for bone disorders in patients with familial hypophosphatemia.\nTaking calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol orally in combination with phosphate supplements is effective for treating bone disorders in people with familial hypophosphatemia (11818).\nless\nHypoparathyroidism. Oral vitamin D increases serum calcium concentrations in people with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism.\nVitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is effective in high doses for increasing serum calcium concentrations in people with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism (11820). Also, taking vitamin D (form unspecified) or calcitriol postoperatively is effective for preventing hypocalcemia in people with hypoparathyroidism due to thyroidectomy (39045).\nless\nOsteomalacia. Oral vitamin D is effective for osteomalacia.\nOral calcifediol is effective for treating osteomalacia secondary to liver disease (hepatic osteodystrophy) and anticonvulsant-induced osteomalacia. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is effective for osteomalacia due to malabsorption syndromes, Fanconi syndrome, and corticosteroid-induced osteomalacia (11819, 11821).\nless\nRenal osteodystrophy. Oral calcitriol prevents renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure.\nTaking calcitriol orally manages hypocalcemia and prevents renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis (11823).\nless\nRickets. Oral vitamin D prevents and treats rickets.\nVitamin D is effective for preventing and treating rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Calcitriol should be used in patients with renal failure (11824). Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from vitamin D fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D to prevent nutritional rickets in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\n\nA large clinical study in pregnant adults shows that taking vitamin D 28,000 IU weekly from the second trimester up to 6 months post-partum decreases the risk of biochemical rickets by about 84% in the offspring at 6-12 months of age when compared with placebo. However, taking vitamin D 4200, 16,800, or 28,000 IU weekly from the second trimester to delivery does not decrease the risk of rickets in the offspring when compared with placebo (114503).\nless\nVitamin D deficiency. Oral vitamin D prevents and treats vitamin D deficiency.\nVitamin D is effective for preventing and treating vitamin D deficiency using a wide range of doses and dosing frequencies (7555, 16888, 16891, 17476, 115590). Optimal blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D for maintaining bone density is controversial; however, it is typically estimated that blood levels of 20-100 ng/mL are needed. Toxicity usually does not occur until levels exceed 150 ng/mL (17476, 93945). Vitamin D also alleviates symptoms and syndromes associated with vitamin D deficiency. Administering vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) intramuscularly or orally seems to help treat severe proximal myopathy associated with severe vitamin D deficiency. Several case reports suggest vitamin D therapy can provide prompt relief of muscle weakness and restore mobility (11923, 84348, 84687).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. Oral vitamin D prevents corticosteroid-induced osteopenia and osteoporosis.\nTaking calcifediol, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol orally prevents corticosteroid-induced osteopenia and osteoporosis (7555, 83933). Vitamin D3 metabolites, including calcitriol and alfacalcidol, seem to be more effective at preventing bone loss compared to cholecalciferol in these patients, although the vitamin D3 metabolites seem to be inferior to bisphosphonates (83955). Furthermore, taking activated vitamin D or other forms of vitamin D alone or along with calcium improves bone mineral density in people with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (38493, 38581).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Adequate intake of vitamin D in conjunction with adequate calcium intake helps to prevent the progression of osteoporosis. It might also reduce the risk of a first fracture in some patients. However, its place in the prevention of secondary fracture is unclear.\nThe Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommends ensuring adequate vitamin D intake of 800-1000 IU daily along with adequate calcium intake for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in adults over 50 years of age. Supplementation can be used to augment dietary intake, with a target serum vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL (109425). In the US, foods that contain at least 120 IU vitamin D can be labelled with a health claim regarding the relationship between adequate vitamin D intake and a reduced risk for osteoporosis (97001). However, vitamin D supplementation is not recommended specifically for the primary prevention of osteoporosis. The US Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) states that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in community dwelling adults without osteoporosis (95695).\n\nClinical research shows that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and calcium can decrease postmenopausal bone loss, improve bone density, help prevent osteoporosis, and decrease the risk of fractures (10932, 12926, 12930, 12934, 12952) (38973, 39015, 39026, 84003, 113584). According to one analysis, taking oral vitamin D3 700-800 IU daily with or without calcium reduces fracture risk in ambulatory and institutionalized elderly people (12933). Other analyses suggest that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcifediol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol with or without calcium can reduce the risk of all fractures by up to 17%, nonvertebral fractures by up to 49%, and hip fractures by up to 30% in older adults. However, the incidence of vertebral fractures does not appear to be reduced with vitamin D supplementation (38942, 38970, 38973, 39015, 39026, 84660, 109053).\n\nDespite the majority of research showing benefit, some studies have not found a positive effect of vitamin D on fracture risk. Some analyses of clinical evidence, including patients with and without osteoporosis, show that taking vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) alone does not reduce fracture risk, suggesting that adequate calcium intake is needed for any benefit to be realized (39015, 84471). Also, some evidence suggests that vitamin D3 400 IU daily is not effective for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in elderly nursing home residents (109053). Another clinical trial found that taking vitamin D3 800 IU daily with calcium 1200-1500 mg daily for 2 years does not increase bone mineral density (BMD) in Black postmenopausal adults. This may be due to the fact that Black females have a lower rate of bone remodeling, an increased calcium absorption efficiency, and reduced calcium excretion when compared with other ethnic groups; therefore, supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium might not be as beneficial in these patients (16878).\n\nThere is concern that vitamin D might not be effective for secondary prevention of fractures in elderly patients. A meta-analysis of clinical studies, including many studies cited above, and a large clinical study in elderly adults with a previous osteoporotic fracture show that taking vitamin D3 400-4000 IU daily or as a single dose up to 500,000 IU orally or injected annually with or without calcium 480-1200 mg daily for up to 5 years does not reduce the risk of hip, vertebral, or other fractures when compared with placebo or no treatment (13073, 112486). Another study also shows that taking vitamin D3 800 IU and calcium 1000 mg daily does not prevent a second fracture in elderly patients, or prevent a first fracture in elderly patients with other risk factors such as low body weight (under 58 kg, 127.6 pounds), smoking, family history of hip fracture, or fair or poor self-reported health (12929). However, these studies have been criticized for failing to measure vitamin D levels and low adherence to study protocol (12931). Also, one of these studies did not use a placebo control (12929).\n\nTaking alfacalcidol orally seems to maintain BMD in prostatic carcinoma patients at risk for osteoporosis when treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRH-a). Alfacalcidol maintains, but does not increase, BMD in these patients (6360).\nless\nPsoriasis. Topical vitamin D or vitamin D analogues improve symptoms of psoriasis. This benefit is not seen with oral vitamin D.\nTopical application of vitamin D in the form of calcitriol or other vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriene, maxacalcitol, and paricalcitol, effectively treats plaque psoriasis in some patients, including those with chronic plaque psoriasis (11822, 84325). Applying topical vitamin D or its analogues in combination with topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone seems to be more effective for treating plaque psoriasis than either agent used alone (22283, 82572, 84325, 84536, 84647).\n\nDespite evidence that patients with psoriasis have low baseline serum levels of vitamin D, taking oral vitamin D does not seem to prevent psoriasis, improve symptoms, or reduce the severity of psoriasis in general (11822, 22283, 82572, 84325, 84536, 84647, 98193, 108426, 112481, 112482). An analysis of a large clinical study in older adults with mild psoriasis shows that taking a vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) loading dose of 200,000 IU followed by vitamin D3 100,000 IU monthly for 1 year does not affect the severity or spread of psoriasis when compared with placebo (98193).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Some research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children and adults. It is unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for the prevention of allergic rhinitis in the child.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with allergic rhinitis and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks along with cetirizine improves overall symptom severity when compared with placebo and cetirizine. This improvement was not significant at 4 weeks, suggesting that symptom improvement might not occur until vitamin D has been adequately replenished (102120). Another moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in adults with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis and vitamin D levels at the low end of the normal range shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily for 4 weeks along with mometasone nasal spray improves runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion but does not reduce sneezing when compared with placebo and mometasone (112483).\n\nIn children aged 5-15 years, 4 small- or moderate-sized clinical trials show that taking vitamin D 800 IU or 1000 IU daily for 1-6 months modestly reduces symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea when compared with placebo or no supplementation (109728). It is unclear whether these children had vitamin D deficiency at baseline.\n\nVitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of three large clinical studies shows that prenatal vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of the child developing allergic rhinitis when compared with low-dose vitamin D, placebo, or no intervention (108438).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with greater risk for and severity of COVID-19 infection. Research of varying quality has evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation in adults with COVID-19 infection, suggesting that it does not reduce overall mortality, but may reduce the risk of intubation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is unclear whether any benefits are correlated to baseline vitamin D status.\nClinical and observational research suggests that prophylactic vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk for and severity of COVID-19 infection in people with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency at baseline. An umbrella review of meta-analyses summarizing data from 9 observational studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for COVID-19 infection and a greater severity of illness when compared with control (114583). Additionally, a separate meta-analysis of 12 observational studies conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that low baseline vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL) is associated with a greater risk of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and mortality when compared with higher levels. However, patients with lower vitamin D levels were also more likely to have baseline hypertension and cardiovascular disease (107206). While earlier meta-analyses suggested that vitamin D supplementation did not prevent COVID-19 (109040, 112488), a larger and more recent meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies conducted in healthcare workers, of whom 85-94% had vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, shows that taking vitamin D reduces the odds of developing a COVID-19 infection by about 80% when compared with control. A separate meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in the general population found no correlation between vitamin D supplementation and risk of COVID-19 infection; however, the people in these studies had adequate vitamin D levels at baseline (113590). The benefits of vitamin D prophylaxis in people with sufficient vitamin D levels is unclear.\n\nClinical studies have evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, assessing hospital length of stay (LOS), the risk of ICU admission, and rate of intubation. Although meta-analyses conducted in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic did not identify an association between vitamin D supplementation and any of these outcomes (107206, 109733, 112490), more recent meta-analyses suggest benefit in certain populations. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with COVID-19 show that vitamin D supplementation may be correlated with a modest reduction in hospital LOS in certain patients when compared with placebo or a lower dose of vitamin D. Subgroup analyses suggest that this reduction may be limited to patients with non-severe disease and those aged 60-65 years and older (115575, 115578). Additionally, more recent meta-analyses of clinical studies show that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of admission to the ICU when compared with control, although the odds ratio varies depending on the analysis conducted (112488, 112490, 115578). Similarly, meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a reduced odds of ICU admission when compared with control (113590, 115578). Also, meta-analyses of clinical studies show that vitamin D supplementation modestly reduces the risk of intubation when compared with control (112488, 115578).\n\nMeta-analyses of observational studies, as well as studies conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic, originally suggested a potential reduction in mortality with the use of vitamin D supplementation during hospitalization (109040, 114583, 115578). However, more recent meta-analyses of prospective clinical studies do not support this finding. A meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies in adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo or standard care, when controlling for heterogeneity. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of 13 clinical studies administering high-dose vitamin D does not show a reduction in mortality (115576). Other meta-analyses of clinical studies also show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce mortality when compared with control, regardless of baseline vitamin D status (114488, 115578).\n\nIn most studies that provided vitamin D to hospitalized patients, oral doses ranged from 1000-25,000 IU daily for 1-3 weeks, 10,000-25,000 weekly for up to 6 weeks or until hospital discharge, or as a single 140,000-600,000 IU dose. In some studies, vitamin D 200,000-500,000 IU was administered intramuscularly as a single dose. Cholecalciferol was the most common form administered. However, some studies used calcitriol or calcifediol (107206, 107208, 109040, 109733, 112488, 112490, 113590, 114583, 115575, 115578). Overall, the validity of the findings from meta-analyses is limited by the significant heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of varying age, disease severity, and baseline vitamin D status, and implemented highly variable vitamin D supplementation protocols.\n\nThe relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 has also been evaluated in pregnant adults. A meta-analysis of observational research suggests that, while lower vitamin D levels are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, the presence of severe COVID-19 symptoms during pregnancy may be correlated to lower vitamin D levels when compared with non-severe COVID-19 symptoms (112025).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for post-COVID-19 symptoms. A clinical study in adults with vitamin D deficiency, as well as fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms for at least one month post-COVID-19, shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks modestly improves fatigue, anxiety, and some aspects of cognitive function, but not symptoms of depression, when compared with placebo (115580). It is unclear if the improvements in anxiety and cognitive function were clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in adults with adequate baseline vitamin D levels.\nless\nDental caries. Some research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces the risk of dental caries in children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) reduces the risk of cavities by 49%, and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) reduces the risk by 36% when compared with placebo in infants, children, and adolescents (84690). The validity of this finding is limited by the heterogeneity of the included trials. Also, clinical research shows an inverse correlation between cord blood vitamin D status and the number of decayed primary teeth in the infant at 12 months of age (104620). However, this same research shows that taking two oral prenatal doses of vitamin D2 50,000 IU during pregnancy does not prevent dental caries in the infant at 12 months of age or increase vitamin D levels in the cord blood (104620).\nless\nHeart failure. Limited research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces the risk of developing heart failure in some patients. However, vitamin D does not seem to improve outcomes in patients that have already developed heart failure.\nPopulation research has found that vitamin D levels below 15 ng/mL are associated with increased risk of developing heart failure (16615). A meta-analysis of 17 trials, including the landmark Randomized Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) trial, shows that vitamin D reduces the risk of heart failure by 21% compared to not taking vitamin D in patients 60 years or older (91343). This finding is limited because none of the included trials were designed to determine effects on cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, a secondary analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative trial shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU with calcium 1000 mg daily is not associated with a reduced risk of heart failure in postmenopausal adults. However, a subgroup analysis of that trial shows that taking vitamin D plus calcium is associated with a 37% lower risk of developing heart failure in postmenopausal adults classified as low-risk for heart failure at baseline. It is speculated that high-risk patients might not benefit from vitamin D plus calcium due to negative interactions with medications used to manage cardiovascular risk factors in this group (97307).\n\nWhile vitamin D might be associated with a reduced risk of developing heart failure, most evidence suggests that vitamin D is not beneficial in patients already diagnosed with heart failure. In one small clinical trial, taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly along with calcium citrate 800 mg daily for 6 months was not associated with an improvement in 6-minute walk test, timed get up and go test (TGUG), electrocardiographic variables, or health status when compared with placebo in adults with heart failure; mortality was not evaluated (97299, 97300). In another clinical trial, taking vitamin D3 2000 IU daily did not decrease the risk of mortality when compared with placebo in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 heart failure patients (16620).\nless\nHyperparathyroidism-related bone loss. Limited evidence suggests that oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nTaking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) orally seems to help decrease secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone turnover in females. In one study, supplementation with vitamin D3 increased serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, reduced levels of parathyroid hormone, and decreased production of markers of bone turnover (3463).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Clinical research shows that oral vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children but not in adults or older adults. Some clinical practice guidelines recommend vitamin D supplements or fortified foods for children to potentially lower the risk of RTIs. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the treatment of RTIs.\nPrenatally, increased levels of vitamin D during pregnancy have been associated with a lower incidence of childhood RTIs (98197). However, two meta-analyses of small clinical studies and one meta-analysis of large clinical studies show no effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of infant or childhood RTIs, including lower RTIs, when compared with control. Results related to risk of wheeze are conflicting (95910, 95912, 108438).\n\nIn children, most research shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of RTIs. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in children aged 1-16 years shows that taking vitamin D decreases the odds of having an RTI by about 29% when compared with control, although this study also identified a high likelihood of publication bias (105721). Daily or weekly vitamin D doses seem to be more beneficial than single bolus doses, although the largest meta-analysis failed to confirm this result (84689, 93766, 105721). One clinical study in preterm Black infants shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 200 IU daily and then 400 IU daily until 6 months of age does not affect the rate of RTIs, but does reduce wheeze by 11%, when compared with a normal diet without vitamin D supplementation (98191). This study may not have been powered to detect a difference in RTIs between groups.\n\nClinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from vitamin D fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D to potentially lower the risk of RTIs in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\n\nIn adults, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of RTIs. Observational research in adults has found that low levels of vitamin D are associated with worsened RTI complications, and even increased mortality in older adults ages 50-75 years (103659). However, meta-analyses of prospective clinical trials in adults show that taking vitamin D supplements 300-4000 IU daily for 7 weeks to 5 years or taking vitamin D 30,000-100,000 IU monthly or 96,000-120,000 IU every 2 months for 1-5 years does not reduce the odds of developing an RTI or severe respiratory complications, such as emergency department utilization, hospitalization, and death, when compared with placebo. These results were similar in subgroup analyses evaluating overall vitamin D dose and baseline vitamin D status (84689, 105721, 114506). The largest single clinical trial, conducted in adults at least 60 years of age, shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 60,000 IU once monthly for up to 5 years reduces the duration of total and severe respiratory symptoms by approximately 0.5 days, but does not reduce the incidence of respiratory illness or hospitalization, when compared with placebo (105726, 110825).\n\nWhen adults and children are evaluated together, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of respiratory infections. Two large meta-analyses of 40 clinical studies in both children and adults shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce the risk of acute RTIs. While subgroup analyses suggest a potential modest reduction in risk of acute RTIs in studies not exceeding 4 months' duration and with daily supplementation of 400-1200 IU during winter, spring, and autumn, these findings are limited by the low quality of the evidence and publication bias (108435, 115582).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for the treatment of RTIs. A large meta-analysis of clinical studies in both children and adults shows that taking vitamin D improves outcomes (e.g., sputum conversion, survival rate, therapeutic success, need for intensive care admission) by a small, but not clinically relevant, amount. In subgroup analyses, these beneficial effects only persisted in studies considered to be of low quality (108436). The validity of these findings is limited by publication bias.\nless\nTooth retention. Oral vitamin D with calcium seems to help with tooth retention in the elderly population.\nA clinical trial in the elderly population shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 700 IU daily along with calcium citrate malate 500 mg daily orally for 3 years reduces the risk of tooth loss by about 52% when compared with placebo (8816).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most research shows that taking vitamin D with or without calcium does not reduce the risk of CVD or CVD complications. There is some speculation that there might be modest benefit in the elderly, but more research is needed to confirm.\nPopulation research has found that low vitamin D levels, especially those below 15 ng/mL, are associated with an increased risk of developing CVD (15630, 16618, 93944, 113588). However, taking vitamin D supplements does not seem to prevent CVD. The majority of evidence from clinical research, population research, and meta-analyses shows that vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, does not reduce the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiac-related hospitalizations, or stroke when compared with placebo in patients with or without CVD risk factors (91343, 97296, 97305, 97308, 98902, 98916, 99762, 109729, 110811, 110827)(112021, 112022, 113588). The most reliable evidence comes from two meta-analyses of mainly high-quality clinical research investigating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or with calcium for at least 1 year. These analyses show that vitamin D does not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, stroke, CVD mortality, or all-cause mortality, regardless of baseline vitamin D level, vitamin D dosage, sex, formulation, or concomitant calcium supplementation (99762, 109729). One large clinical trial in individuals at increased CVD risk shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol 60,000 IU monthly modestly INCREASES the risk of CVD- and presumed CVD-related mortality (110827).\n\nThe effect of vitamin D supplementation in elderly adults on CVD outcomes has also been evaluated. In some research, taking vitamin D 700-1000 IU daily shows a trend towards lower CVD events and reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients (11931, 98916, 99762). However, another study in adults aged 70 years or older without a history of cardiovascular events and who are vitamin D replete at baseline shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 3 years does not decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, or hypertension when compared with placebo (113581). Larger, high-quality trials with prespecified primary outcomes are needed to determine whether or not vitamin D supplementation reduces CVD risk in elderly populations.\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Taking vitamin D 540,000 IU as a single oral dose does not reduce death or hospital stay in critically ill patients. However, limited research suggests that taking a smaller dose of vitamin D long-term might have a modest benefit.\nThe most robust evidence to date shows that correcting vitamin D levels in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency does not reduce mortality rate or duration of hospital stay. A large, multicenter clinical study in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency shows that administering a single, enteral dose of vitamin D 540,000 IU does not reduce 90-day all-cause mortality, duration of hospital stay, ventilator-free days, or other clinical outcomes when compared with placebo (103656). A previous meta-analysis of clinical research showed that vitamin D supplementation administered for a duration of 7 days or up to 6 months reduces the risk of death by 30% in critically ill hospitalized patients (95913). However, included studies were of low methodological quality, had high heterogeneity, assessed patients with and without vitamin D deficiency, and used variable vitamin D dose regimens and administrations methods (95913, 95914).\nless\nFractures. Most evidence shows that oral vitamin D alone does NOT prevent factures in people who do not have osteoporosis. Some research shows that taking vitamin D with calcium prevents fractures; however, more research is needed to determine who is most likely to benefit.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin D alone does not seem to prevent fractures in older adults. Most adults in these studies did not have osteoporosis, although osteoporosis status was unclear in some research (10140, 12933, 14282, 38970, 39015, 84660, 95822, 97296, 102145, 104619)(109059, 110827). However, several meta-analyses suggest that taking higher doses of vitamin D (about 800 IU daily) in combination with calcium might reduce overall fracture risk in older patients (38942, 38970, 39015, 84660, 102145, 110809). One meta-analysis of clinical research in community- or long-term care-living males and females at least 65 years of age shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily in combination with calcium reduces the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures by 25% and 20%, respectively, compared with placebo (110809). However, discrepancies exist which are possibly related to the dose and form of calcium used in combination with vitamin D and/or the patient population. Some research shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily in combination with calcium 1200 mg daily as tricalcium phosphate reduces fracture risk by up to 31% while taking vitamin D with calcium carbonate does not reduce fracture risk (12929, 14282, 16878, 110809). Some individual clinical studies in postmenopausal females aged 50-79 years show that taking vitamin D plus calcium daily for 2-7 years does not prevent fractures when compared with placebo (14282, 16878). Other confounding variables include the possible additional effects of hormonal therapy when given with calcium to postmenopausal adults and/or the inclusion of institutionalized patients with unclear osteoporotic status (95822, 97296).\n\nMost research shows that taking vitamin D in combination with omega-3 fatty acids does not prevent fractures. A large clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily and/or strength training three times weekly does not prevent fractures in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo (104619). Another large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily, alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, over approximately 5 years does not prevent overall fractures, nonvertebral fractures, or hip fractures in adults over 50 (males) or 55 (females) years old when compared with placebo. Although the osteoporosis status of the population was unclear, findings were consistent in adults at high fracture risk based on use of osteoporosis medications and/or a history of fragility fractures (109059).\n\nAs of April 2018, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against supplementing with vitamin D 400 IU daily or less along with calcium 1000 mg daily or less for preventing primary fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal adults. The USPSTF also concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether supplementing with doses of vitamin D greater than 400 IU daily along with calcium doses greater than 1000 mg daily is safe or effective for preventing fractures in community dwelling adults without vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a history of fracture (95695). For information on patients WITH osteoporosis, refer to the Osteoporosis discussion.\n\nThere is limited research available regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention in children. Preliminary research in children aged 2 to 17 years with vitamin D insufficiency and one or more previous fractures shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily with calcium 600 mg daily for 6 months modestly reduces the risk of forearm fractures over 12 months compared with children not given vitamin D or calcium (110820).\nless\nHypertension. Overall, vitamin D does not seem to prevent or lower high blood pressure in most patients; however, it may lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency.\nAlthough population research has found that lower vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of developing hypertension, clinical research shows vitamin D supplementation does not prevent hypertension (15630). A large clinical trial in postmenopausal adults shows that taking vitamin D3 400 IU with calcium 1000 mg daily does not reduce the risk of developing hypertension (16714).\n\nMost meta-analyses and clinical trials in patients with existing hypertension show that vitamin D supplementation does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo, regardless of vitamin D formulation, dose, or duration of supplementation (16714, 91340, 96405, 103657, 104619, 113583, 113668). However, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency shows that supplementation with vitamin D reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 7 mmHg and 3 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo (100895). Another meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients over 60 years of age with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D supplements significantly reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with placebo, especially in trials lasting more than 8 weeks where the total dose of vitamin D is above 400,000 IU (113592). An individual clinical study in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly or 1000 IU daily reduces systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and mean arterial pressure by about 4 mmHg, but does not affect diastolic blood pressure, when compared to baseline (108440).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral vitamin D does not appear to affect prostate cancer progression or cancer-related mortality.\nA meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that vitamin D supplementation does not affect prostate cancer progression as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or mortality in patients with prostate cancer (99770).\nless\nPsychosis. Oral vitamin D does not seem to improve symptoms in patients with a functional psychotic disorder.\nA clinical study in adults with a functional psychotic disorder shows that taking oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 20,000 IU monthly for 6 months has no effect on total positive and negative syndrome scale score (PANSS) when compared with placebo. The majority of patients included in this study were deficient in vitamin D at baseline (107226).\nless\nTuberculosis. Oral vitamin D seems to be ineffective for reducing the severity of tuberculosis or mortality from tuberculosis. Limited research suggests that vitamin D may have small benefits in newly diagnosed patients receiving tuberculosis treatment for the first time.\nAlthough population research has found that tuberculosis is associated with vitamin D deficiency, most clinical research shows that taking vitamin D does not improve clinical outcomes in people with tuberculosis infection. Meta-analyses and individual clinical studies show that taking vitamin D as a single 100,000 IU dose, or as 400 IU daily for 2 months, along with standard care does not improve tuberculosis severity or reduce the risk of mortality in children or adults with tuberculosis, regardless of their baseline vitamin D levels (82570, 82475, 98913, 103655, 103668, 104022).\n\nHowever, some research has identified modest benefits in newly diagnosed patients receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment for the first time. A meta-analysis of clinical research in this population shows that taking vitamin D at a dose of 1000 IU daily or 600,000 IU monthly modestly increases the odds of sputum smear conversions by 1.2-fold, but does not improve the time to sputum smear conversions, when compared with placebo (98235). A small clinical study in treatment-naïve adults with low levels of serum vitamin D shows that taking calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for up to 6 months, starting with anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation, decreases the time to sputum smear conversion and 50% lesion absorption by about 3 days when compared with not taking vitamin D (109045). Additionally, a small clinical study in children aged 6-18 years with vitamin D insufficiency receiving standard treatment for newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis shows that taking vitamin D 1000 IU daily reduces the duration of fever and cough by 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, when compared with placebo (108437).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for acne.\nA small clinical trial in patients with acne and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily for 2 months reduces the number of inflammatory lesions by about 35%, compared with 6% in those taking placebo. There was no effect on the total or non-inflammatory lesion count (106127). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking alfacalcidol (One Alpha, LEO Company, Denmark) 0.25 mcg daily for 3 months modestly improves acne severity when compared with taking placebo (106128). In addition, population research has found that individuals with acne have modestly lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls. The odds of vitamin D deficiency were approximately three times higher in patients with acne when compared with healthy controls (106105).\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial for preventing age-related cognitive decline.\nPooled results of two large clinical sub-studies in community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older show that taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily for 2-3 years has no effect on cognitive decline when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis in Black patients suggests a modest effect of vitamin D when compared with placebo (108428).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for this condition.\nSome population research has found that lower serum concentrations of vitamin D are associated with higher risk of Alzheimer disease, and also with decreased cognition. People with Alzheimer disease seem to have serum concentrations of vitamin D that are about 2.5 ng/mL lower than patients without Alzheimer disease (84672, 103666). However, other population research has found that vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) or insufficiency (25-50 nmol/L) is not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease (100899).\nless\nAsthma. Oral vitamin D might reduce asthma exacerbations in adults and children with mild, but not severe or persistent, asthma. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy or the first 6 months of an infant's life does not seem to prevent the development of asthma later in infancy or childhood.\nPopulation research in patients with asthma suggests that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and increased need for medication therapy (94693). However, findings from clinical research are mixed. Some meta-analyses of clinical trials in adults and children with asthma show that taking vitamin D for 3 months to 1 year reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31% to 38% when compared with control (92690, 94686, 115584). However, other meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo (109728, 109732, 110833). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. However, some clinical research suggests that vitamin D supplements might only prevent asthma in people with non-persistent asthma (92690, 94685, 94686, 94688, 104020). Also, many studies are small and do not represent patients with severe asthma exacerbations (92690, 94687). Baseline levels of vitamin D may play a role. A clinical study in children aged 6-16 years with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels shows that taking vitamin D 4000 IU daily for 48 weeks does not reduce severe asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo (104020). However, a meta-analysis including this study shows that taking vitamin D does reduce risk of asthma exacerbations in children with low baseline vitamin D levels (109728). Additionally, two meta-analyses show that taking vitamin D seems to modestly improve pulmonary function when compared with placebo (109732, 115584). Vitamin D doses have varied, with oral doses of 200-4000 IU daily, 1000-14,000 IU once weekly, 60,000 IU once monthly, 120,000 IU every 2 months, 100,000 IU 14 days apart, or 100,000 to 600,000 IU as a bolus dose followed by 400-4000 IU daily (92690, 94686, 104020, 109728, 110833, 115584).\n\nVitamin D supplementation for the prevention of asthma in infants has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of 4 large clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D 400-1200 IU daily for the first 6 months of life does not reduce the risk of asthma or wheezing at 6-30 months of age when compared with control (112031).\n\nVitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated (97306, 99763, 102146, 112031). A meta-analysis of 3 large clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D 2800-4400 IU daily during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy reduces the risk of recurrent wheezing by 23% but does not reduce the risk of asthma diagnosis within the first 3-6 years of life when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily (112031). Some research suggests that the dose of vitamin D plays a role. A meta-analysis shows that prenatal vitamin D 800 IU daily reduces the odds of wheeze or asthma by 32%, while lower or higher vitamin D doses were not beneficial (103661).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for athletic performance.\nOne small clinical trial in athletes shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 or 40,000 IU once weekly for 2 doses does not affect performance on vertical jumps, sprints, or leg and bench presses when compared with placebo (98188). Another small clinical trial in professional rugby players shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU once every two weeks over 12 weeks does not improve sprinting speed or the ability to perform bench presses, bench pulls, and chin-ups when compared with placebo (98189). Also, most research shows that taking vitamin D does not improve measures of cardiorespiratory fitness. One small study in young males undergoing resistance training shows that taking vitamin D 8000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not improve cardiorespiratory fitness compared with taking placebo (110812).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Most research shows that oral vitamin D reduces eczema severity in children. However, most research shows that oral vitamin D, taken during pregnancy or infancy, does not prevent eczema in the child.\nA meta-analysis of eight moderate-quality clinical trials in children shows that taking vitamin D, most commonly 1000-2000 IU daily for 4-12 weeks, modestly reduces severity of eczema when compared with placebo (109728). Most of the children in these studies were also given conventional medications.\n\nOral vitamin D has also been evaluated for eczema prevention. A meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that consuming vitamin D 2800-4400 IU daily during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy is not associated with a reduced risk for eczema in children during the first 3 years of life when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily (97306). Another meta-analysis of five large clinical studies shows that prenatal or infant vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of developing eczema when compared with low-dose vitamin D, placebo, or no intervention (108438).\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing atrial fibrillation.\nA large clinical trial in adults without cardiovascular disease shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for an average of 5 years does not reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo or fish oil 840 mg daily (105209). However, observational research in postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis found that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation when compared with not taking vitamin D (98922). Also, one large observational study in vitamin D-deficient patients with no history of atrial fibrillation has found that vitamin D supplementation for at least 6 months is associated with up to a 16% decreased risk of atrial fibrillation when compared with not taking vitamin D. There were also modest improvements in atrial fibrillation-free survival. In males 65 years and older with hypertension or diabetes at baseline, blood levels of at least 30 ng/mL following vitamin D supplementation were associated with decreased risk of atrial fibrillation; a post-supplementation blood level of 21-29 ng/mL was not associated with decreased risk (109043).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for ADHD.\nA small clinical trial in children 5-12 years of age with ADHD and vitamin D insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily along with methylphenidate for 8 weeks seems to improve parental ratings of evening, but not morning or overall, symptoms of inattentiveness and impulsivity when compared with methylphenidate alone. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as levels less than 30 ng/mL (98196). Based on these and other preliminary findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is weakly recommended for adjunctive use in children with ADHD, especially those with insufficient intake or skin exposure to sunlight (110318).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for autism spectrum disorder.\nA small clinical study in children aged 2.5-8 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 12 months modestly reduces irritability and hyperactivity when compared with placebo (99767).\nless\nAutoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear of oral vitamin D improves outcomes in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nA meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis shows that taking vitamin D for at least 12 weeks increases free triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels, and reduces levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin antibody, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, when compared with placebo or no treatment (113593).\nless\nBack pain. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for reducing chronic low back pain.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in adults with chronic low back pain shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce pain scores when compared with placebo, regardless of baseline vitamin D status or duration of supplementation. Oral vitamin D dosages used in these studies included 400-4000 IU daily for 1-6 months, 50,000 IU once weekly for 8 weeks, or 150,000-300,000 IU as a single dose. Intramuscular dosages ranged from 150,000-300,00 IU as a single dose (115588).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for bacterial vaginosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in females at high risk for sexually transmitted disease shows that taking vitamin D along with standard therapy for bacterial vaginosis does not reduce the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis when compared with placebo. Patients in this study had been treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days along with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU each week for 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks for the remaining 20 weeks (91348).\nless\nBariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation after bariatric surgery attenuates any bone health-related complications.\nClinical research in adults who had undergone bariatric surgery shows that vitamin D supplementation in doses of 800-7900 IU daily improves vitamin D status when compared with placebo. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation in these doses for 1 year improves parathyroid hormone levels or bone mineral density or reduces fracture risk (115589).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of breast cancer.\nSome population research evaluating intake of calcium plus vitamin D suggests that higher vitamin D intake is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal or postmenopausal adults (15631). Similarly, a large observational study in females with a biological sibling with breast cancer has found that taking vitamin D recently or prior to enrollment is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer when compared with nonrecent vitamin D use or never taking vitamin D, respectively (107215). However, other research found that higher vitamin D intake is associated with a 17% reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal and perimenopausal, but not postmenopausal, adults (39001). Observational research has also examined the association between blood levels of vitamin D and risk of developing breast cancer. A meta-analysis found that those with serum levels of about 52 ng/mL had a 50% lower risk of developing breast cancer when compared with those with serum levels of less than 13 ng/mL. This high serum level of vitamin D corresponds to a high dose of about 4000 IU daily (16049). Other observational research has found that baseline vitamin D levels of more than 20 ng/mL are associated with a 48% reduced risk of developing breast cancer over approximately 9 years in Latina females in the US when compared with levels below 20 ng/mL; however, this association was not present in Black females (109058).\n\nDespite the contradictory findings from observational research, results from clinical research are generally negative. Evidence from one large-scale clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative) shows that postmenopausal adults who take vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily plus calcium 1000 mg daily for 7 years do not have a significantly reduced risk of developing breast cancer (16715, 98895). Also, a meta-analysis of two large-scale clinical trials, which did not include the Women's Health Initiative trial, shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily, alone or with calcium, for 3-4 years does not reduce the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal adults, although there was a trend towards reduced risk with higher doses of vitamin D supplementation (97301). While vitamin D and calcium supplementation during the intervention period of the Women's Health Initiative trial was not associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a precursor to breast cancer, a secondary post-hoc analysis of the data shows that supplementation reduces the risk of developing DCIS by 18% over a median follow-up of 19 years (107216). Additional research is needed regarding an optimal dose of vitamin D, timing of initiation, and whether any benefit is affected by menopausal status.\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Limited research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is linked with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the infant.\nObservational research has found that vitamin D deficiency at birth is associated with about a 2-fold increased odds of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (104021). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial.\nless\nCancer. Vitamin D does not seem to reduce overall cancer risk. However, some research shows that vitamin D might slightly reduce the risk of metastatic cancer and cancer-related mortality.\nThere is interest in vitamin D for cancer PREVENTION, as observational research suggests that higher vitamin D intake and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of cancer (111150). While individual clinical trials evaluating vitamin D for cancer have produced inconsistent findings, most meta-analyses and clinical trials show that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) alone or with calcium does not significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer (15629, 91344, 93943, 97296, 98916, 104024, 104618, 110811). However, vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of metastatic cancer and cancer-related mortality. A large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D3 2000 IU daily for a median of 5.3 years slightly reduces the risk of advanced metastatic or fatal cancers when compared with placebo (104618). Additionally, meta-analyses of several large clinical trials show that taking vitamin D 400-4000 IU daily, with or without calcium, for 1-7 years reduces the risk of cancer-related mortality by 12-13% when compared with control, while intermittent bolus dosing of vitamin D at high doses for 1-5 years does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer-related mortality (104024, 111149).\n\nThe role of vitamin D in cancer TREATMENT is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical and observational research suggests that supplementation of vitamin D after a cancer diagnosis is associated with a modest improvement in overall survival, but not progression-free or cancer-specific survival (109726). Doses used in clinical research ranged between 1200 IU and 8000 IU daily or 100,000 IU every 50 days, after surgery and/or during treatment (99195, 99196, 109726). Other clinical research in patients with luminal gastrointestinal cancers shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of relapse when compared with placebo (99195). It is unclear which, if any, types or stages of cancer respond best to vitamin D, and what dose of vitamin D is optimal.\nless\nChild growth. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving infant growth or bone structure.\nMeta-analyses and individual clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy modestly increases length at birth and bone mineral density at up to 7 years of age when compared with control, usually placebo or vitamin D 400 IU daily. However, there was no effect on length in the infant up to one year of age, weight at birth or up to one year of age, head circumference at birth or up to 6 years of age, bone mineral content at up to 6 years of age, or neonatal bone mineral density, bone mineral content, bone area, or femur or humoral length (98198, 109737, 112028, 115585). In the available research, vitamin D was taken in doses of 200 IU to 4400 IU daily, 4200 IU to 50,000 IU weekly, 50,000 IU every 2 weeks, or 60,000 IU every 4-8 weeks, starting from the early to late stages of pregnancy and usually continued until birth (98198, 109737, 115585).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with CKD. Most research suggests that it does not reduce the risk for adverse cardiovascular events.\nPopulation research in patients on dialysis has found that vitamin D levels less than 17.8 ng/mL are associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with higher levels (16619). A meta-analysis and individual clinical studies show that vitamin D and vitamin D analogues decrease parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and urine protein levels in people with CKD (84376, 84377, 84628, 98233, 98236). However, taking vitamin D does not appear to decrease the risk of death or parathyroidectomy in CKD patients (84376, 84377). Also, taking vitamin D increases the risk for hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in this patient population (84376, 84377, 98236).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with CKD. Observational research has found that vitamin D deficiency in patients with CKD is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. However, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to be beneficial. One clinical study shows that taking paricalcitol, an active form of vitamin D, titrated to maintain adequate serum calcium levels, for 48 weeks does not affect the size of the left ventricle or heart function when compared with placebo (98233). Other clinical research in Japanese patients on hemodialysis for CKD shows that adding alfacalcidol, another active form of vitamin D, 0.5 mcg daily to standard treatment for 4 years does not affect mortality or cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions, stroke, aortic dissection, and others compared to standard treatment only (98920). Also, a large clinical trial in patients with CKD shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily, alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, does not affect major cardiovascular events or invasive cancer when compared with placebo (110811).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for musculoskeletal health in adults with CKD. A small clinical study shows that taking cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily, with or without physical activity, for 3 months improves bicep strength, but not back flexibility or aerobic fitness capacity, when compared with baseline. In patients taking cholecalciferol in combination with physical activity, musculoskeletal health was similar when compared with cholecalciferol alone (108431). However, this study was inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups, and it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups.\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for the improvement of iron status in adults with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical research shows that taking Vitamin D as cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 Forte Renapharma) 8000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not improve iron status compared with taking placebo. However, a sub-analysis shows that hemoglobin levels are modestly improved in patients with a low Vitamin D status at baseline suggesting that Vitamin D might improve iron availability in these patients (110819).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for COPD; benefits may be limited to patients with severe vitamin D deficiency.\nPopulation research has found an association between low vitamin D levels and reduced lung function, increased risk of developing COPD, and worsening COPD severity (17685, 96401). However, 3 meta-analyses of clinical research in adults with COPD show that, overall, oral vitamin D does not have beneficial effects on mortality, rate of COPD exacerbations, pulmonary function, or most measures of symptom severity when compared with placebo (109732, 112485, 115586). A subgroup analysis suggests that any benefits of vitamin D supplementation may be limited to patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 25 nmol/L) at baseline (115586).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for cognitive function.\nPopulation research has found that low vitamin D levels are associated with worse cognitive performance and cognitive decline when compared to high vitamin D levels in healthy adults (84672, 95916). However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function is unclear. One small meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation does not improve cognitive function (95916). However, the included trials evaluated a widely heterogeneous study population and utilized variable measures of cognitive function.\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\nA small clinical study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking vitamin D3 10,000 IU three times weekly for 20 weeks in addition to exercise and cognitive training does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo and exercise with or without cognitive training. However, most participants had sufficient serum vitamin D levels at baseline (112489).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of colorectal cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that a higher serum vitamin D level is associated with decreased risk of mortality and increased survival in patients with colorectal cancer (16101, 99196). However, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation improves survival in patients with colorectal cancer, as research has generally involved small populations and results are somewhat conflicting. A subgroup analysis of one clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of relapse or death, death due to any cause, or relapse over 5 years when compared with placebo in patients with colorectal cancer (99195). However, this subgroup may have been underpowered to detect between-group differences. Another small clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer shows that taking high-dose vitamin D 8000 IU daily during the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then 4000 IU daily for subsequent cycles, does not increase median progression-free survival when compared with taking vitamin D 400 IU daily. However, patients taking high-dose vitamin D were 36% less likely to experience disease progression or death during follow-up when compared with patients taking the lower dose of vitamin D (99196). This latter result suggests that high-dose vitamin D supplementation might be beneficial for patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but larger, multicenter studies are needed to confirm.\n\nThe role of vitamin D in colorectal cancer prevention has also been investigated. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that a higher serum vitamin D level is associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk; however, sub-analyses suggest that this association only occurs in females, not males (109740). Most studies have evaluated vitamin D supplements in combination with calcium; the effects of vitamin D supplementation alone are unclear. One meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D plus calcium is not associated with a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer in people with a low baseline risk of colorectal cancer (39042). Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, does not reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer or colorectal adenomas (109730). Additionally, a large clinical trial suggests that postmenopausal adults who take calcium 1000 mg daily plus vitamin D 400 IU daily do not have a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (14290, 98895). One clinical study shows that taking calcium supplements reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas, but not in people with lower than average vitamin D levels (12118).\nless\nCrohn disease. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D reduces relapses in patients with Crohn disease.\nA meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, shows that taking high- or low-dose vitamin D for up to 1 year reduces the rate of relapse when compared with control (98915). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for dementia.\nPopulation research has found that patients with any type of dementia have serum concentrations of vitamin D that are about 2.5 ng/mL lower than patients without dementia (84672). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for treating depression. Vitamin D does not seem to prevent the development of depression.\nThe role of vitamin D in the treatment of depression is unclear. Earlier meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation does not improve overall symptoms of depression. However, some subgroup analyses suggest that vitamin D may be beneficial for improving the symptoms of depression in people with clinically significant symptoms, as well as those with baseline vitamin D deficiency (97295, 97298). More recent meta-analyses of several clinical trials, that include some of the same studies, show that vitamin D modestly improves symptoms of depression in adults; however, subgroup analysis suggests that vitamin D does not improve depressive symptoms in older adults (110832, 112786). These analyses are mixed over whether baseline vitamin D status affects results (110832, 112786) and one of these analyses shows no evidence that the type of depression affects findings (110832). Another meta-analysis of generally small clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and depression shows that taking vitamin D modestly improves depressive symptoms when compared with placebo or no intervention (110814). Although, results of an individual clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes are in contrast (108423). The evaluated research implemented one-time doses of 150,000-500,000 IU, as well as daily and weekly doses ranging between 400-5000 IU daily or 5000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks to 2 years, with the most evidence of benefit related to one-time high doses. Cholecalciferol was the most common form of vitamin D used (97295, 97298, 108423, 110814, 110832, 112786). Significant heterogeneity between studies and the wide variability in dosing strategies limit the validity of these findings, as well as identification of an effective dose or target population.\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of depression. One large clinical study (VITAL-DEP) in healthy patients 50 years and older shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for about 5.3 years does not prevent depression or depressive symptoms, or improve mood, when compared with placebo (103670). An analysis of a cohort of patients from the VITAL-DEP trial also shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 2 years does not reduce the risk of major depressive disorder or improve mood scores in patients with subthreshold depression or risk factors for late-life depression when compared with placebo (112032). In addition, a meta-analysis of several clinical studies suggests that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent depression based on subgroup analysis of patients without depression at baseline (112786).\n\nBased on these and other preliminary findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is weakly recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in patients with depression, especially those with insufficient intake or skin exposure to sunlight (110318).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral vitamin D might improve glycemic indices in some patients with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of type 1 or gestational diabetes.\nMost meta-analyses of mainly small clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for measures of glycemic control in adults with diabetes. However, the best evidence of benefit is in people with baseline vitamin D deficiency. Five meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes show that vitamin D supplementation reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.2% to 0.3%, and improves serum insulin, fasting blood glucose, and measures of insulin resistance when compared with control (96403, 110822, 112487, 115581, 115583). Supplemental vitamin D seems to be most beneficial in patients with baseline vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (96403, 107210, 110822, 112487, 115581). Furthermore, correlation analysis suggests an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and serum insulin, fasting blood glucose, and measures of insulin resistance (112487). In most clinical studies vitamin D supplementation ranged from 1000-6000 IU daily, 20,000-60,000 IU weekly, or 100,000-400,000 IU once over 8-48 weeks (96403, 107210, 110822, 115581, 115583). Most analyses exhibited significant heterogeneity related to vitamin D dosing regimen, geographic location, and patient population.\n\nHowever, one meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that vitamin D improves HbA1c, insulin resistance, and insulin measures in studies lasting less than 6 months, but not in studies lasting longer than 6 months (99764). An additional meta-analysis suggests that most evidence of benefit is associated with doses of more than 2000 IU daily for 4-12 weeks (110822). Another meta-analysis suggests that benefits may be greater in adults with less severe obesity and a shorter duration of type 2 diabetes (115583).\n\nVitamin D has been evaluated for the prevention of type 1 diabetes. There is preliminary evidence that daily vitamin D supplementation (form not specified) in infants during the first year of life is associated with a reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes development later in life (10139). Also, a meta-analysis of population studies has found that vitamin D supplementation in early childhood is associated with a 29% reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life (84225).\n\nVitamin D has been evaluated in adults with gestational diabetes, yielding conflicting findings. One clinical trial shows that oral vitamin D 50,000 IU every 4 weeks modestly reduces levels of insulin, as well as measures of insulin resistance, with no effect on fasting blood glucose (106125), whereas other clinical research shows that this same dosing regimen modestly reduces levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, with no effect on insulin measures (106126). A separate clinical study shows that taking oral vitamin D 500 IU twice daily in yogurt modestly improves all measures of glycemic indices (101775). Additionally, a large clinical trial shows that taking oral vitamin D 1600 IU daily modestly reduces fasting blood glucose when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily (112020). Some clinical research also shows that oral vitamin D modestly improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with control (106125, 110823), although not all research agrees (106126). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking oral vitamin D reduces the risk of premature birth and neonatal hospitalization by approximately 63% and 62%, respectively (110823). A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies shows that taking oral vitamin D 400-1000 IU daily for 6 weeks or 50,000 IU twice over 6 weeks along with calcium decreases fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin when compared with placebo (115579). One small clinical study shows that giving vitamin D 300,000 IU as a single intramuscular injection at 24-28 weeks' gestation does not affect HbA1c (106124).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of gestational diabetes. A Cochrane analysis of one large clinical study shows that taking vitamin D during pregnancy does not lower the risk of gestational diabetes when compared with no supplementation (114587). In addition, a meta-analysis of population studies suggests that there is a U-shaped association between serum vitamin D levels and the risk of developing gestational diabetes, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 40-90 nmol/L associated with the lowest risk (106109). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with insulin resistance during pregnancy, but not gestational diabetes, shows that taking vitamin D at varying doses for 6-26 weeks modestly decreases measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (110821). However, this study did not evaluate whether vitamin D prevented the development of gestational diabetes in these patients.\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One study evaluated vitamin D in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 360 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 240 mg twice daily, suggesting that this combination improves glycemic markers when compared with taking vitamin D alone (106122). Other clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking vitamin D with omega-3 fatty acids 8,000 mg twice daily for 6 weeks modestly improves glycemic indices when compared with placebo (106114). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers.Details: A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking vitamin D modestly reduces ulcer size and improves glycemic and lipid indices when compared with placebo (110835). This meta-analysis is limited by the availability of three small clinical trials, as well as the heterogeneous doses of vitamin D in the included studies.\nDiabetic nephropathy. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D improves some markers of kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking vitamin D or its analogs reduces inflammatory markers and protein in the urine, but does not affect measures of kidney function such as serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate, when compared to control (99771).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in diabetic retinopathy.\nThere is weak evidence from observational research suggesting a link between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic retinopathy (112095). However, clinical research addressing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for treatment or prevention of diabetic retinopathy is lacking.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Limited evidence suggests that oral vitamin D reduces pain in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nA meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in patients with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin D in doses ranging from 5000 IU daily to 300,000 IU monthly modestly reduces pain when compared with control (112029). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including differences in blinding and control interventions, vitamin D doses and frequency of supplementation, and baseline vitamin D levels. Another small clinical study in adolescent patients with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 9 weeks modestly reduces pain when compared to baseline (98912). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for ED.\nAlthough some data suggest ED is associated with low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels, preliminary research in males aged 60-84 years shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU once monthly for up to 5 years does not prevent or improve ED when compared with placebo (113580).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Small studies suggest that vitamin D does not improve exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA meta-analysis of 6 small studies shows that taking vitamin D before and/or during exercise does not improve circulating levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, or myoglobin when compared with placebo (107218).\nless\nFall prevention. The role of vitamin D in fall prevention is confusing and controversial. Most clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily decreases the risk of falls, with effects most apparent with daily over intermittent dosing and in those with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Taking vitamin D at doses higher or lower than this may be associated with increased risk of falls.\nHigher serum levels of vitamin D have been associated with improved lower-extremity function in elderly adults (15636). Clinical research in older adults shows that taking vitamin D or vitamin D analogues, with or without calcium, reduces the number of people who have a fall by up to 19% (39038, 84215, 84374, 84539, 94130, 104023, 113595, 114504). Other research shows that vitamin D, with or without calcium, reduces number of falls by 19% to 50% (11939, 16275, 84404, 93941, 109053). The beneficial effect does not appear to depend on the form of vitamin D used (ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol) (39038, 84374, 113595). Multiple meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin D leads to a decreased rate of falls in patients with low baseline levels of vitamin D, but not in those with adequate vitamin D levels (84670, 84684, 109053, 114504). One meta-analysis also suggests that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol up to 1000 IU daily reduces fall risk by up to 19%, whereas higher doses do not reduce fall risk (109053). Also, daily dosing, but not intermittent dosing, seems to be associated with a reduced risk of falling (109053, 114504). Similarly, another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily, with or without calcium, lowers the risk of falls by about 15-26% when compared with placebo, no treatment, or calcium alone. However, taking vitamin D 500 IU or less daily and vitamin D 1100 IU or more daily, with or without calcium, is not associated with a lower risk of falls and may even increase the risk of falls by 22-44% (114504).\n\nDespite the above meta-analyses, other clinical research shows that vitamin D does not reduce the risk of falling (84404, 84670), the rate of falls overall (84670, 93942), or the rate of injurious falls (93942) in elderly patients (93942). One study in adults over 70 years of age with a history of falling found that taking high-dose vitamin D, either as 60,000 IU monthly or 24,000 IU plus calcifediol 300 mcg monthly, increased both the risk of falling and the mean number of falls compared to a lower dose of 24,000 IU monthly (93940). One meta-analysis of 20 trials including nearly 30,000 patients shows that taking vitamin D, with or without calcium, does not reduce the risk of falling in elderly patients, regardless of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D achieved with treatment, duration of treatment, or residential status of the patients (91342). While a meta-analysis of 10 trials in nearly 6,000 patients shows that taking vitamin D 700-1000 IU daily with calcium 1000-2000 mg daily reduces the risk of falling in the elderly by 12% when compared with placebo or no treatment, a meta-analysis of 21 trials in nearly 52,000 patients shows that vitamin D alone is only associated with a reduced risk of falls in patients with baseline vitamin D levels of less than 50 nmol/L when compared with placebo or no treatment (107224). The 2018 US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for fall prevention acknowledges this research by recommending AGAINST vitamin D supplementation for fall prevention in community dwelling adults 65 years of age and older who do not have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency (95703).\n\nThe reasons for the disparate study results may have to do with the way in which clinical trials have reported outcomes. Clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D on fall risk may report results as the number of patients who experience one or more falls, the total number of falls, or the rate of falls per individual. This can affect ultimate conclusions and, in some cases, can be misleading. For example, when studies report on only the total number of falls, it is unclear if vitamin D reduces the rate of falls across the study population, or if it only reduces falls in a small subset of patients. Also, analyses of research suggest that the size of the clinical study appears to affect the trial results. Most trials showing significant reductions in fall risk have been small and of short duration (91342, 94132); whereas larger and longer-term studies tend to show no benefit (13073, 84399).\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Taking vitamin D during pregnancy might reduce the risk of fetal or early infant death.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of intrauterine or neonatal death by 31% when compared with not supplementing with vitamin D. A sub-analysis shows that this benefit was limited to doses of up to 4000 IU daily (109055). However, a Cochrane review suggests that the evidence linking vitamin D supplementation to a lower risk of fetal or neonatal death is very uncertain (114587).\n\nClinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of intra-uterine and neonatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) birth. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\nless\nFibromyalgia. A small clinical study suggests that vitamin D might improve pain in patients with fibromyalgia.\nA small clinical study in fibromyalgia patients with low vitamin D levels shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1200-2400 IU daily seems to reduce pain, but not mood or quality of life, when compared with placebo (91349).\nless\nFood allergies. It is unclear if prenatal or infant oral vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of developing food allergies.\nA meta-analysis of two large clinical studies shows that prenatal or infant vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of developing food allergies when compared with low-dose vitamin D or no intervention (108438).\nless\nFrailty. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of frailty in older adults.\nFrailty involves a combination of muscle loss and weakness, with exhaustion and reduced ability for physical activity. Some observational research has found that low vitamin D status is associated with frailty occurrence. However, clinical research in community dwelling older adults shows that taking vitamin D as 1000 IU, 2000 IU, or 4000 IU daily for 24 months does not prevent frailty or attenuate the worsening of frailty when compared with low-dose vitamin D 200 IU daily. Baseline vitamin D status did not affect these findings. Also, a sub-analysis suggests that vitamin D 2000 IU might increase frailty; however, only a small number of participants were randomized to this dose (109046). Other clinical research in community dwelling adults at least 70 years of age shows that taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily for 3 years does not reduce the odds of becoming pre-frail or frail over 36 months when compared with placebo. However, when taken in combination with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily and a home exercise program, the odds of becoming pre-frail is reduced by 39% (110829).\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). A small clinical study suggests that vitamin D may modestly improve anxiety in patients with GAD.\nA small clinical study in patients with GAD shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU once weekly for 3 months, in addition to taking an antidepressant and an anxiolytic, moderately reduces anxiety scores when compared with taking these medications alone (103654).\nless\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving outcomes in patients receiving HSCT.\nA small clinical study in patients who have undergone an autologous HSCT shows that taking calcitriol 0.25 mcg three times daily for 30 days can reduce the time to absolute lymphocyte count recovery, but does not affect time to recovery of absolute neutrophil and platelet counts, when compared with placebo (103665).\nless\nHepatitis C. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an inadequate response to hepatitis C therapy. Adding vitamin D to standard therapy for hepatitis C may improve viral response, especially in specific genotypes.\nA small clinical trial in patients with hepatitis C genotypes 2-3 receiving standard therapy with PEG-interferon and ribavirin shows that adding vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 24 weeks results in 95% of patients achieving undetectable levels of hepatitis C RNA, compared to only 77% of patients treated with standard therapy alone (98917). Another small clinical study in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1b receiving the same standard therapy shows that adding vitamin D 1000 IU daily for 16 weeks results in about 79% of patients achieving undetectable levels of hepatitis C RNA, compared to about 55% of patients treated with standard therapy alone. The TT genotype seems to be especially susceptible to vitamin D supplementation, while TG/GG genotype does not seem to be susceptible (98923).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving bone mineral density (BMD) in children and young adults with HIV.\nVitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism are common in children and young adults with HIV. A meta-analysis of two clinical trials in this population shows that taking cholecalciferol for 12 months does not improve spine BMD when compared with placebo. Also, an analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking doses of 1600 IU to 4000 IU daily does not improve spine BMD when compared with taking doses of 400-800 IU daily. However, taking higher dose vitamin D has a small beneficial effect on total BMD when compared with taking lower doses. There was no improvement on parathyroid hormone levels (110824). This meta-analysis is limited by the availability of small clinical trials, as well as the heterogeneous doses of vitamin D used in the included studies.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although population research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with improved lipid levels, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial. Clinical research results are conflicting.\nPopulation research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with lower vitamin D levels (15630, 98919). However, supplementation might not be beneficial. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies suggests that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, alfacalcidol, or calcitriol slightly increases LDL cholesterol, but does not affect total cholesterol, triglycerides, or HDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo (84642). The validity of these findings is limited by the variability in patient populations, vitamin D dose and formulation, and study duration. Also, none of the included studies were prospectively designed to test the effect of vitamin D on lipid levels. Another meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population of healthy adults and adults with metabolic disease shows that taking vitamin D 1400-50,000 IU weekly with calcium 500-2000 mg daily results in very modest improvements in total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol levels, but not LDL or very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that effects are more pronounced in people with metabolic disease (107227). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which persisted throughout subgroup analyses.\nless\nHyperthyroidism. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research suggests that serum vitamin D levels are decreased in patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease taking methimazole and low levels of selenium and vitamin D shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol for 270 days, in combination with selenium for the first 180 days, modestly reduces levels of serum free thyroxine and improves quality of life when compared with no vitamin D or selenium. However, taking vitamin D and selenium did not affect levels of free triiodothyronine or positive thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody (109049).\nless\nHypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with vitamin D deficiency and subclinical hypothyroidism shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 2-12 weeks decreases mean thyroid stimulating hormone levels by about 20% when compared with placebo, or by 3.55 mIU/L when compared to baseline (107213, 113589).\nless\nIchthyosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with inherited ichthyosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with congenital non-syndromic ichthyosis shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 24 weeks reduces the clinical severity of disease at 12 weeks, but not 24 weeks, when compared with baseline. When compared with patients taking acitretin 0.5 mg/kg daily, results were similar at both 12 and 24 weeks, but it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups (108441).\nless\nIgA vasculitis. It is unclear if oral alfacalcidol is beneficial in children with IgA vasculitis.\nA clinical study in children with IgA vasculitis shows that taking alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg daily along with vitamin C, rutin, dipyridamole, cimetidine, calcium, and glucocorticoids for 4 weeks improves rates of recurrence and incidence of kidney damage when compared with those receiving the same regimen without alfacalcidol. Alfacalcidol also improves cellular immune function and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers (107212).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Taking vitamin D might slow prediabetes progression to diabetes in people with low baseline levels of vitamin D or in people achieving high levels of vitamin D following supplementation. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in people with prediabetes and sufficient vitamin D levels.\nObservational research has found that low vitamin D levels are linked with a higher risk of prediabetes and higher dietary vitamin D is linked with a lower chance of developing diabetes (84594, 103669). Meta-analyses and individual clinical studies in patients with prediabetes and unclear or sufficient vitamin D levels show that vitamin D supplementation might improve some glycemic indices, but does not seem to prevent progression of prediabetes to diabetes (84594, 91347, 99769, 108421). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies designed to evaluate the preventative effects of oral vitamin D shows that taking it in the form of cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily or 20,000 IU weekly or eldecalcitol 0.75 mcg daily reduces the risk of developing diabetes with an absolute risk reduction of 3.3% over 3 years when compared with placebo. However, the actual risk reduction is highly dependent on vitamin D status. Patients achieving the highest serum vitamin D levels have absolute 3-year risk reductions of 11.4% to 18.1% (110810). In patients with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes, vitamin D might improve beta-cell function, suggesting reduced disease progression (99768, 107210). One clinical study in adults with vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 3 months, and then monthly for 3 months, modestly improves insulin resistance and beta-cell function as measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), but does not affect fasting or postprandial glucose levels when compared with placebo (99768). Further, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes shows that oral vitamin D at a median dose of 50,000 IU weekly for 26 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose and some markers of islet function, but not postprandial blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, when compared with control. Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving vitamin D supplementation regressed from prediabetes to normal glucose status (107210). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in overweight or obese children and adolescents shows that high doses of vitamin D, 4000 IU daily or higher for 12-52 weeks, reduce HOMA-IR and C-reactive protein levels, but do not affect body weight, cholesterol, or parathyroid hormone (113596). A study in females with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 IU daily, has no effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes at 2 years (107211).\n\nClinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, with moderate certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation in addition to lifestyle modification for adults with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as vitamin D from supplements or fortified food above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if giving oral vitamin D in doses above the recommended dietary allowance during infancy is beneficial for improving neurodevelopment. It is also unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for improving cognitive development in the offspring.\nClinical research shows that giving vitamin D 1200 IU daily to healthy term infants of Northern European ethnicity starting at 2 weeks of age does not improve measures of neurodevelopment at 2 years of age when compared with giving the standard dose of vitamin D 400 IU (106121).\n\nOverall, the evidence from population research is mixed as to whether vitamin D status during gestation is associated with infant developmental outcomes. However, some population research has found that increased vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with improved anthropomorphic and neurodevelopmental outcomes (104621, 105724). Two meta-analyses of observational research show that low vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with reduced head circumference and cognitive development scores, and higher odds of the offspring developing autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (105724, 105725). However, one meta-analysis suggests these risks may be limited to those with very low vitamin D status (serum level < 12 ng/mL) (105724). Multiple meta-analyses show that vitamin D status during pregnancy does not appear to affect motor development (105724, 105725).\n\nIn one observational study, plasma vitamin D concentrations in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased IQ scores in the offspring at age 4-6 years. Each 10 ng/mL increase in vitamin D levels was associated with a 1.17-point increase in IQ (104621). In contrast, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 2800 IU daily during the third trimester does not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first 6 years of life when compared to taking lower doses of 400 IU daily (104623).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial in females with infertility.\nObservational research in females undergoing in vitro fertilization suggests no association between dietary vitamin D intake and oocyte quality, successful embryo transfer, clinical pregnancy rate, or term pregnancy rate (112097). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical research in females with infertility shows that, although there was no effect of taking vitamin D on implantation rate or miscarriage, taking vitamin D increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by 49% when compared with placebo. However, sub-analyses of clinical and observational research found that benefits on clinical pregnancy rates were limited to populations with vitamin D insufficiency, but not vitamin D deficiency, and for doses between 1000 to 10,000 IU daily for 30-90 days (110818). Most studies included in the analysis used oral vitamin D; however, intramuscular vitamin D was used in one cohort study. A smaller meta-analysis of clinical studies in females with infertility and vitamin D insufficiency undergoing IVF shows that taking vitamin D increases the rate of chemical pregnancy by 50%, but has no effect on the clinical pregnancy rate (108432).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for IBS; the available research is conflicting.\nAlthough some meta-analyses show that taking vitamin D is moderately more effective than placebo for improving IBS symptom severity and quality of life, other analyses disagree. Doses of vitamin D have included 50,000 IU weekly or every 2 weeks or 2000-4000 IU daily for up to 6 months (109041, 109054, 109057). The reasons for these discrepancies might be attributed to the inclusion criteria related to the individual trials, the small sample sizes, and varied dosing strategies used in the available research.\nless\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial for improving allograft function or preventing non-skeletal complications in kidney transplant recipients.\nFollowing a kidney transplant, patients are at increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency and related outcomes. A large clinical trial shows that taking a high dose of cholecalciferol for 2 years does not reduce the composite risk of developing type 2 diabetes, major cardiovascular events, or cancer, or death when compared to taking a lower dose. The high and low doses of vitamin D were 100,000 IU or 12,000 IU, respectively, every 2 weeks for 2 months, followed by monthly doses for the next 22 months (110830). The effect of a high dose of vitamin D on these outcomes individually is not clear. However, taking vitamin D does not seem to improve allograft function. A clinical study in kidney transplant recipients shows that taking cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily, beginning 1-month posttransplant and continuing for 11 months, has no effect on allograft function when compared with placebo (108425).\nless\nKidney transplant-related bone loss. Oral vitamin D might be beneficial for preventing bone loss associated with kidney transplantation.\nA large clinical trial shows that taking a high dose of cholecalciferol for 2 years modestly reduces the odds of a fracture by 76% when compared to taking a lower dose. The high and low doses of vitamin D were 100,000 IU or 12,000 IU, respectively, every 2 weeks for 2 months, followed by monthly doses for the next 22 months (110830). A prespecified secondary analysis of a clinical study in patients at 1-month post-kidney transplant from a living donor in Japan shows that taking vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 4000 IU daily for months 1-12 posttransplant reduces whole blood parathyroid hormone levels by 15%, but does not alter levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5-b or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, when compared with placebo. The greatest effects on parathyroid hormone levels are observed in those with more severe vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and more preserved kidney function. Vitamin D supplementation also attenuates changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, but not the distal radius, from prior to transplant. Patients taking vitamin D had a loss of only 0.2%, compared with a loss of 2% in those receiving placebo. The greatest effects are observed in those with osteoporosis or osteopenia (107220). Conversely, a small clinical trial shows that taking calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 0.25 mcg daily in combination with calcium carbonate 500 mg daily does not decrease bone loss associated with kidney transplantation. However, calcitriol might reduce osteoclast suppression, help maintain trabecular bone volume and wall thickness, and improve axial BMD (4823).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for lichen planus.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly in combination with systemic steroids for 1 month reduces pain severity and improves healing of lesions when compared with systemic steroids alone (114586). The validity of the study is limited by the lack of a placebo.\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral vitamin D can reduce the risk for low birth weight; the available evidence is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that a very low vitamin D status (serum level <12 ng/mL) during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight and increased odds of SGA births. However, these risks have not been demonstrated in those with less severe vitamin D deficiency (serum level <20 ng/mL) (105724). Most research also shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of low birth weight. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that supplementation with vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily starting between 27 and 32 weeks' gestation, or 200,000 IU administered as a single dose or in two divided doses during the seventh and eighth month of pregnancy, reduces the risk of delivering a low birth weight infant by 60% (84659). Other meta-analyses of clinical research show that supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy results in a 31% to 60% reduced risk of low birth weight and a 103 gram greater average birth weight when compared with placebo or no intervention (99766, 114587). However, some meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of low birth weight when compared with no supplementation (95910, 109055). One meta-analysis that included studies that did not directly measure birth weight shows no effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the rate of low birth weight, despite showing an increase in overall birth weight of about 58 grams (95910).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D prevents lung cancer or improves lung cancer prognosis.\nA small meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational research has found that high intake of vitamin D is associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of developing lung cancer when compared with low vitamin D intake. In terms of prognosis, high vitamin D intake is associated with improvements in both overall survival and relapse-free survival (107217).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial in males with infertility.\nA small clinical study in males with infertility shows that taking cholecalciferol 2500 IU daily for 6 months modestly improves progressive sperm motility, sperm concentration, and sperm morphology when compared with baseline (108427). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMelanoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with melanoma.\nA meta-analysis of 14 observational studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a 45% greater risk of melanoma when compared with normal vitamin D levels (112027). However, a small clinical study in patients with newly resected stage II melanoma shows that taking vitamin D3 100,000 IU every 50 days for 3 years does not improve disease-free survival when compared with placebo. Most patients in this study had vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency at baseline (106113).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing or treating metabolic syndrome.\nIn patients with metabolic syndrome, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 16 weeks does not affect most metabolic or anthropometric factors when compared with placebo, although there was a modest decrease in triglyceride levels (106123). However, almost all of the individuals in this study were vitamin D deficient or insufficient, and many remained in that category even after supplementation. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in vitamin D sufficient patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence about the association between vitamin D and metabolic syndrome (14265, 16713, 98234). Some population research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, while other research found no association (14265, 16713). Furthermore, a small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 IU or 40,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks does not affect metabolic risk factors when compared with placebo (98234).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral vitamin D reduces the frequency of migraine.\nA meta-analysis of three small high-quality clinical studies in patients with migraine shows that taking vitamin D 2000 or 4000 IU daily for 12-24 weeks or 500,000 IU weekly for 2 months reduces the frequency of migraines by 2-3 attacks monthly when compared with usual care or placebo (108439).\nless\nMiscarriage. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing vitamin D 50 mcg, alpha-lipoic acid, hyaluronic acid, magnesium, and vitamin B6 daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone (113893). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo for the control group.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although vitamin D supplementation has been linked with a lower risk of developing MS, taking oral vitamin D supplements does not seem to reduce MS relapses.\nVitamin D deficiency appears to be linked to the risk of MS development and progression. Population research suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin D 400 IU is associated with a 40% lower risk of MS in females. The effect seems to be dose-dependent. Consumption of at least 400 IU daily, mainly in the form of a multivitamin supplement, appears to have the greatest protective effect (11356). Additional population research in over 7 million people suggests that higher levels of calcifediol are associated with a lower risk of developing MS. In white adults, for every 20 ng/mL increase in vitamin D levels, there appears to be a 41% decrease in MS risk. However, this was not found in black and Hispanic adults (15159).\n\nVitamin D supplementation has also been examined in patients with MS. Population research suggests that taking vitamin D supplements and the maintenance of optimal blood levels of vitamin D are associated with a reduction in the development of new areas of demyelination detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 24 months. However, there are no correlations between vitamin D consumption or vitamin D blood levels and clinical outcomes (110816). Also, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to impact MS relapses or most symptoms in patients with MS. Meta-analyses of preliminary clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation does not affect the rate of MS relapses, overall symptoms, disability scores, or the number of MS nerve lesions detected by MRI, regardless whether the vitamin D was low-dose or high-dose (98192, 98914, 106119, 113586). However, one meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D for 8-96 weeks slightly improves fatigue scores when compared with placebo (112024). These analyses are limited by the small size and heterogeneity of most of the included studies and variability in dosing and duration of vitamin D regimens.\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral vitamin D improves muscle strength in middle aged or older adults with low or sufficient levels of vitamin D. The available research is conflicting.\nClinical research in healthy older adults who are not deficient in vitamin D shows that oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation, with 800 IU, 1000 IU, or 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU monthly, alone or in combination with a resistance training program, does not increase muscle strength when compared with placebo (11814, 104619, 108429). In patients 40-80 years of age with low vitamin D levels, taking vitamin D3 100,000 IU (2500 mcg) once, followed by 20,000 IU (500 mcg) weekly for 4 months, does not improve muscle strength when compared with placebo (103658). Similarly, meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D does not increase grip strength, muscle mass, global muscle strength, or back extensor strength when compared with control (91341, 113595).\n\nHowever, some research has found some benefit with the use of vitamin D supplements. One meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin D increases grip strength after menopause when compared with placebo or low-dose vitamin D, although a sub-analysis shows that beneficial effects are limited to individuals aged 60-69 years, when vitamin D is taken without calcium, when baseline vitamin D levels are at least 30 ng/mL, or when the treatment consists of the vitamin D analog alfacalcidol. This suggests heterogeneity between studies (109048). Another meta-analysis in elderly adults shows that taking vitamin D as calcifediol 10-30 mcg daily for a median of 24 weeks modestly improves hand grip strength and leg extension, but not leg flexion, when compared with baseline (109042). Also, some individual clinical research in older adults with low levels of vitamin D at baseline shows that taking vitamin D3 800 IU daily or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 1000 IU daily for 12 months in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily modestly improves lower extremity or hip strength by 8% to 23% when compared with calcium alone (38915, 84530).\nless\nMyalgia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for reducing myalgia associated with obesity.\nPreliminary clinical research in obese individuals with vitamin D deficiency who are on a low-calorie diet shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly, alone or in combination with an aerobic exercise program three times weekly for 12 weeks, modestly reduces muscle pain when compared with only aerobic exercise three times weekly (106118).\nless\nMyelodysplastic syndromes. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.\nA small observational study in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes has found that taking calcitriol or calcifediol orally is associated with slowed disease progression (11825).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial in children or adults with NAFLD.\nAlthough findings from individual research are mixed, one meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in patients with NAFLD shows that vitamin D modestly improves insulin resistance and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with no effect on serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Most studies included in the analysis used oral vitamin D 1000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly or biweekly for 3-6 months and compared with placebo; however, one study used a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D 600,000 IU compared with lifestyle modifications (109056). Vitamin D has also been evaluated in combination with fish oil. A clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking oral vitamin D3 1680 IU daily in combination with fish oil or fish oil alone for 3 months improves serum ALT levels similarly to a control group (107186).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for use in children with NAFLD. One clinical study in children with obesity and biopsy-proven NAFLD shows that taking oral vitamin D3 2000 IU daily for 6 months with a hypocaloric diet improves liver histopathology in terms of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and NAFLD activity score at 6 months, but not hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis, when compared with baseline. These improvements were not seen in the group receiving placebo with a hypocaloric diet, but it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups (107222).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing keratinocyte carcinomas.\nIn middle aged and older adults recently diagnosed with a colorectal adenoma, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 1000 IU daily for 3-5 years does not reduce the incidence of keratinocyte cancer when compared with placebo over a median of 8 years. A sub-group analysis shows that taking vitamin D3 with calcium 1200 mg daily as calcium carbonate reduces the risk of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by a moderate amount, but has no effect on the risk of basal cell carcinoma. Vitamin D taken alone has no effect on the risk for either type of cancer (104622).\nless\nObesity. The evidence for the use of oral vitamin D in obesity is conflicting and unclear.\nPopulation research has found that people with lower vitamin D levels are significantly more likely to be obese when compared to people with higher vitamin D levels (15630). Also, a large-scale, high-quality clinical trial in postmenopausal adults taking calcium 1000 mg plus vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily for 3 years shows that these patients are more likely to lose weight and maintain their weight when compared with those taking placebo. This beneficial effect is mainly seen in females who have inadequate intake of calcium, less than 1200 mg/day, before starting a calcium supplement (15604). However, other evidence suggests that vitamin D alone does not improve weight loss. One clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D3 2000 IU/day without calcium for 12 months does not increase weight loss when compared with placebo in overweight and obese postmenopausal adults who are deficient in vitamin D at baseline (91345).\nless\nOrthostatic hypotension. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for prevention of orthostatic hypotension.\nA secondary analysis of a clinical study in older patients with vitamin D insufficiency who are at an increased risk for falls shows that taking vitamin D 1000-4000 IU daily for up to 2 years has no effect on the risk of orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic symptoms when compared with those receiving vitamin D 200 IU daily (107223).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nThe evidence for the use of vitamin D in osteoarthritis is conflicting. Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily, or at a higher dose to reach serum vitamin D levels over 36 ng/mL, for 2 years does not reduce knee pain or loss of cartilage when compared with placebo in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (84688). However, another clinical study shows that taking vitamin D3 daily for 10 days and then vitamin D3 60,000 IU monthly for 12 months modestly reduces pain and improves function when compared with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis and vitamin D insufficiency (98199). It is possible that higher doses of vitamin D have an effect on osteoarthritis, while lower doses do not. Due to this conflicting and low-quality evidence, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends against the use of vitamin D for any form of osteoarthritis (102114).\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with otitis media.\nThe relationship between vitamin D status and otitis media is unclear. Population research has found that having otitis media is associated with lower blood levels of vitamin D; however, lower vitamin D levels were not associated with greater risk of otitis media (98194).\nless\nOveractive bladder. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for overactive bladder in children or adults.\nA large clinical trial in older males shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily for 5 years does not reduce the odds of weekly overactive bladder when compared with placebo. In males with low baseline serum vitamin D, taking vitamin D reduces the odds of overactive bladder at 5 years by 49%, including 34% reduced odds of overactive bladder with urinary incontinence and 81% reduced odds of overactive bladder without incontinence. However, urinary incontinence while sleeping or napping was increased (109738).\n\nVitamin D has also been evaluated for overactive bladder in children with low vitamin D levels. A large, single-blind clinical study in children with overactive bladder without urinary incontinence, and with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, shows that taking vitamin D 2400 IU daily for 8 weeks with standard urotherapy reduces voiding frequency by about 3 or 4 voids daily when compared with standard urotherapy, with or without solifenacin 5 mg daily (115574, 115591). Standard urotherapy was defined in this study as medical education, timed voiding, and pelvic floor muscle training.\nless\nOverall mortality. Taking oral vitamin D alone does not seem to reduce mortality; however, there is some evidence that taking certain forms of vitamin D with calcium might have a modest benefit.\nWhile higher vitamin D levels have been associated with a small reduction in mortality when compared with lower vitamin D levels (98187), clinical research shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce the risk of mortality. A comprehensive meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation alone does not reduce all-cause mortality when compared to control (100900). However, giving vitamin D with calcium may modestly reduce the risk of mortality. Meta-analyses show a 4% to 9% reduced risk of mortality when trials of vitamin D alone and vitamin D with calcium are pooled together (16102, 97296, 98186, 112022). Finally, some research suggests that the type of vitamin D supplementation might influence the results. A meta-analysis of clinical research found that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) with or without calcium reduces mortality risk by 6%, while alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) do not have benefit (84595, 98186). Other clinical research suggests that vitamin D supplementation in older adults may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by about 4%, with an estimated effect size of 6 fewer deaths per 1000 individuals. This finding informed the 2024 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on vitamin D for the prevention of disease in the general population. The Endocrine Society conditionally recommends, with moderate certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from fortified foods or vitamin D-containing supplements in the general population aged 75 years and older to potentially lower the risk of mortality. Empiric vitamin D is defined as vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status. For empiric supplementation and for those who have indications for vitamin D treatment or supplementation, daily lower-dose versus intermittent higher doses was suggested (114502).\nless\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for chronic pain.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with chronic pain shows that taking vitamin D for 1-24 months produces a 43% greater decrease in pain score when compared with placebo. However, the final follow-up pain score is similar for both groups (96402). The effect of vitamin D on pain based on pain-related diagnosis, vitamin D status, or dose is unknown.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for this condition.\nPopulation research found that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with milder Parkinson disease symptoms, while deficiency is associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease (97000, 99772). One small study shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1200 IU daily for one year might modestly slow the progression of Parkinson disease based on the Hoehn and Yars staging criteria. However, there was no improvement in disease severity according to the more widely used Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Stage (UPDRS). The UPDRS includes measures of activities of daily living and non-motor symptoms. Vitamin D had no effect on most quality of life measures (95915).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for periodontal disease.\nA meta-analysis of mostly observational research suggests that vitamin D levels are not associated with an increased or decreased risk of periodontitis (112026). Other population research suggests that higher blood levels of vitamin D may be associated with a reduced risk of periodontal disease in adults 50 years of age or older. However, this association was not found for adults younger than 50 years (15634).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin D improves muscle strength in elderly adults.\nSome clinical research in healthy older adults who are not deficient in vitamin D shows that oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation, with 800 IU, 1000 IU, or 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU monthly, alone or in combination with a resistance training program, does not improve physical performance when compared with placebo (11814, 104619, 108429). Also, results from one meta-analysis of clinical research in postmenopausal females with low levels of vitamin D shows that taking vitamin D does not improve the timed up and go test when compared with placebo or low-dose vitamin D (109048). One meta-analysis that included studies specifically evaluating the use of calcifediol in older adults shows a large benefit on gait speed; however, only one study included in the analysis used this endpoint and other measures of physical performance were not affected (109042).\nless\nPneumonia. High-dose oral vitamin D does not reduce pneumonia severity in children.\nAlthough vitamin D supplementation might prevent respiratory tract infections in children, it might not prevent recurrent pneumonia. A small clinical study in children under 5 years of age with recurrent pneumonia and variable vitamin D blood levels shows that taking vitamin D 300,000 IU quarterly for 1 year does not reduce respiratory infections, severity of pneumonia, hospital admissions, or disease complications when compared with placebo (103667). However, it's unknown if vitamin D supplementation using lower and more frequent doses, or supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency, might be beneficial. Some observational research has found that having vitamin D deficiency is linked to a higher risk for developing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (102118). For information on other respiratory infections, refer to the Respiratory Tract Infection discussion.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if vitamin D improves pregnancy rates and outcomes, clinical symptoms, metabolic parameters, or hormone levels in patients with PCOS.\nObservational research in adults with infertility, PCOS, and insulin resistance suggests that normal vitamin D levels are associated with better embryo quality and increased pregnancy rate when compared with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (100834).\n\nIt is unclear if supplementation with vitamin D improves pregnancy rates in patients with PCOS. A meta-analysis of several mostly low-quality clinical studies in patients with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency at baseline shows that intramuscular or oral vitamin D 200-10,000 IU daily for up to 24 weeks in addition to fertility treatment improves pregnancy rates and reduces premature miscarriage and premature delivery, but does not impact the incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational hypertension or gestational diabetes, when compared with control. This analysis also suggests vitamin D supplementation improves certain IVF-related outcomes including ovulation rate, fertilization rate, and number of mature oocytes (112787). An earlier meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 400-12,000 IU daily for 2-6 months improves follicular development when compared with placebo. Taking vitamin D in combination with metformin 1500 mg daily also appears to increase the number of regular menstrual cycles by 85% when compared with metformin alone, but without an effect on follicular development (96404). However, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that combining vitamin D with metformin probably does not improve menstrual cycle regulation when compared with metformin alone (113594).\n\nThe effect of vitamin D on the hormonal and metabolic profiles of patients with PCOS has also been evaluated. An umbrella review of up to 15 meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with PCOS shows that taking vitamin D 2000-8500 IU daily for 6.5-13.5 weeks reduces levels of serum triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total testosterone, but not body mass index (BMI) or insulin levels, when compared with placebo (115577). A separate meta-analysis of 9 clinical studies, not included in the umbrella review, shows that combining vitamin D with metformin reduces insulin resistance, BMI, and testosterone levels when compared with metformin alone (113594). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily in combination with diet and exercise for 12 weeks reduces insulin resistance, BMI, waist to hip ratio, serum triglyceride levels, and total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with diet and exercise alone (114580). The interpretation of the results in this clinical study is limited by the lack of a placebo control.\nless\nPost-stroke fatigue. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for post-stroke fatigue.\nA retrospective study in patients with post-stroke fatigue and vitamin D deficiency suggests that vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 600 IU daily is associated with improvements in fatigue severity at months 1 and 3 when compared with control. Neurologic disability also showed improvement at 3 months, but not at 1 month, when compared with control. It is unclear if improvements from baseline differed between groups (107225).\nless\nPrecocious puberty. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of precocious puberty.\nA meta-analysis of 43 mostly observational studies from China suggests that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with 2.25-fold greater odds of precocious puberty when compared with normal vitamin D levels. Taking vitamin D 200-1000 IU daily for 3-12 months along with a gonadotropic-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) is associated with lower luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol levels and reduced bone age when compared with GnRHa therapy alone (112019). Another meta-analysis of 15 studies, mainly from China and with high heterogeneity and publication bias, suggests that there is a negative correlation between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations and precocious puberty, and that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of precocious puberty by about 53% (113578).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of pre-eclampsia.\nWhile some clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (113585, 114587), clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) birth, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with gestational hypertension.\nMeta-analyses of two low-quality clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk for gestational hypertension when compared with control (95910, 114587).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if taking vitamin D during pregnancy prevents respiratory complications in preterm neonates.\nA large clinical study in pregnant patients with gestational age less than 34 weeks and at risk of preterm delivery shows that a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D 50,000 IU within 72 hours before delivery decreases the risk of respiratory distress syndrome treated by surfactant in the neonate by about 2.25-fold and increases the 5th minute APGAR scores, but not 1st minute APGAR scores, gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, or delivery method, when compared with no treatment (114581).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with PMS.\nObservational research has found that increasing dietary intake of vitamin D above 706 IU daily is linked to a reduced risk of developing PMS when compared with consuming 112 IU daily (13094). Furthermore, a clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU daily in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily can decrease the severity of PMS symptoms (16869). Another clinical study in adolescent females with PMS shows that taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 9 weeks modestly reduces PMS symptoms when compared to baseline (98912). A small clinical study in young adults with PMS and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU every 2 weeks for 16 weeks reduces psychological symptom scores by 54% and physical symptom scores by 39% when compared with placebo (113582).\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preterm labor.\nVitamin D deficiency, defined as serum levels less than 20 ng/mL, during pregnancy has been associated with a 25% greater risk of preterm birth (95911). The risk seems to be especially prominent in those with darker colored skin (103662). However, meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of a preterm birth when compared with no supplementation with vitamin D (84659, 95910, 109055, 114587).\n\nThe effect vitamin D specifically in vitamin D-deficient patients is still unclear. Some small, heterogeneous, and low-quality studies show that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the rate of preterm birth in vitamin D-deficient patients (84659, 95910). Additional studies are needed to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of preterm birth.\n\nClinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) birth, preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation iss defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin D may not improve symptoms in patients with RA.\nPopulation research has found that higher intake of vitamin D from foods or supplements is associated with a lower risk of developing RA (12206, 98200). However, a meta-analysis of two small clinical trials shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce pain or recurrence of RA when compared with placebo (98190).\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients over 12 years of age with chronic sinusitis shows that taking 1 or 2 sachets of a specific combination product (Flogostop Forte, Humana Italia) containing vitamin D 600 IU, black currant, Boswellia serrata, and bromelain along with a nasal corticosteroid daily for 15-30 days reduces symptoms of nasal hyperemia and rhinorrhea when compared with corticosteroid nasal spray alone (111501). It is unclear if these findings are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSarcopenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in older adults with sarcopenia.\nA meta-analysis of randomized trials in older adults with sarcopenia shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 100-800 IU daily, with protein 10-44 grams daily or amino acids 2.5-6 grams daily, for 2-6 months moderately improves muscle strength, but not muscle mass or walking speed, when compared with placebo (105727). The validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity and an unreported baseline vitamin D status. Similarly, a small network meta-analysis of randomized trials shows that taking vitamin D 500-1600 IU daily or 2500-5000 IU weekly with protein 20-80 grams daily or amino acids 3-32 grams daily with and without exercise for 3-18 months increases hand grip strength and shortens time to chair-stand, respectively, but not gait speed or lower-limb mass when compared with usual care (107221). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, protein/amino acid supplementation, exercise, or the combinations.\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for schizophrenia.\nBased on preliminary clinical evidence, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is not recommended for adjunctive use in patients with schizophrenia (110318).\n\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking a specific combination product (BioZenD, Tak Gen Zist Pharmaceutical Company) containing vitamin D 400 IU in combination with a blend of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacillus coagulans) 2 x 109 CFU daily for 12 weeks improves cognitive function scores but does not improve the severity of positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms when compared with placebo (114582). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin D, the probiotics, or the combination.\nless\nSciatica. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary research in adults up to 45 years of age with discogenic sciatica shows that taking cholecalciferol 800 IU with alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and resveratrol daily for 30 days, in combination with a 20-session rehabilitation protocol, improves pain, disability, and quality of life when compared with the supplements alone or the rehabilitation protocol alone (112933).\nless\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD). One small study suggests that a large dose of oral vitamin D can improve symptoms of SAD.\nA small clinical study in patients with SAD suggests that a single dose of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 100,000 IU improves symptoms after one month when compared to baseline (83791). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nSeborrheic keratosis. It is unclear if topical vitamin D analogues improve symptoms of seborrheic keratosis.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that topical ointments containing activated vitamin D in the form of tacalcitol, calcipotriol or maxacalcitol, applied for 3-12 months, can reduce tumor volume by at least 40% in 75% of patients with seborrheic keratosis. Additionally, over 30% of patients seem to experience complete tumor resolution or a reduction in tumor volume of at least 80% (84033). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nSexual dysfunction. One small study suggests that injecting a large dose of vitamin D might improve sexual function.\nA small clinical study in females with vitamin D deficiency and sexual dysfunction shows that receiving an intramuscular injection of vitamin D as cholecalciferol 300,000 IU once at baseline and a second time 4 weeks later improves sexual function at 4 and 8 weeks when compared with placebo (100896).\nless\nSickle cell disease. One small study suggests that oral vitamin D reduces pain and improves quality of life in children with sickle cell disease with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.\nA small clinical study in children with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 40,000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks reduces days with pain and improves physical activity and quality of life for up to 6 months when compared with placebo. Of the children included in the study, 82.5% had vitamin D insufficiency, while 52.5% were deficient in vitamin D (98918). It is unclear if vitamin D is effective for patients with sickle cell disease who have adequate levels of vitamin D.\nless\nSmall for gestational age (SGA). It is unclear if oral vitamin D can reduce the risk for SGA births; the available evidence is conflicting.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research show no effect of vitamin D on the risk of SGA birth (84659, 109055). However, one meta-analysis shows a 40% reduction in the risk of SGA births with vitamin D supplementation (95910). Also, one meta-analysis shows that when vitamin D supplementation is initiated before the 20th week of gestation, the risk of SGA is reduced by 54% (109055). Most individual clinical trials are small and heterogeneous. Also, the formulation of vitamin D and/or vitamin D status at baseline may explain part of the discrepant findings. For example, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that a very low vitamin D status (serum level <12 ng/mL) during pregnancy is associated with increased odds of SGA births. This association does not seem to be present with less severe vitamin D deficiency (serum level <20 ng/mL) (105724).\n\nClinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, with low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of SGA births, as well as preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status (114502).\nless\nStatin-induced myalgia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with statin-induced myalgia.\nObservational research has found that taking oral vitamin D supplements is associated with decreased symptoms of myalgia in patients taking statin drugs. In a small case series, patients who discontinued statins due to myalgia were able to resume statin therapy after starting vitamin D supplements. The majority of patients with myalgia were found to be vitamin D deficient, with vitamin D levels less than 12 ng/mL at baseline (16829). An observational study has also found that administering 50,000 units of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) once a week for 12 weeks reversed symptoms of myalgia in 92% of statin treated patients with low serum vitamin D levels of less than 32 ng/mL (16831).\nless\nStroke. Although low vitamin D levels are associated with higher risk of stroke, taking vitamin D supplements does not seem to reduce stroke risk.\nPopulation research has found that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of stroke. Furthermore, increased dietary intake of vitamin D is associated with a reduced risk of stroke (15630, 16618, 93944, 97303, 106106). However, clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce stroke risk. Several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials show that taking vitamin D alone or with calcium does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with or without cardiovascular disease risk factors (16616, 91343, 97296, 97308, 106106, 112022). It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these studies, as they did not assess whether patients had adequate vitamin D levels at baseline. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation might prevent strokes in patients with vitamin D deficiency.\nless\nSunburn. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin D for the treatment of sunburns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this purpose.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with SLE.\nWhile some observational research has found that adults with SLE are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency than healthy controls (102119), a small cross-sectional study in females has found no association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, SLE disease activity, and the presence or absence of lupus nephritis (107214). A meta-analysis of three small clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly seems to reduce anti-dsDNA positive, a marker of disease activity, when compared with placebo in patients with SLE (98190). However, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. A small clinical trial in females with SLE shows that taking vitamin D3 5000 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly improves overall disease activity, but not quality of life, when compared with placebo (109735).\nless\nThyroid cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with thyroid cancer.\nObservational research in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer suggests that taking vitamin D daily for at least 6 months after surgery is associated with a 38% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 33% lower risk of total cancer-related mortality when compared with no vitamin D supplementation at around 10 years' follow-up. However, vitamin D does not appear to be linked to a lower risk of thyroid cancer-related mortality in these patients (112018).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nA meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in patients treated with mesalazine shows that taking vitamin D for up to 24 weeks modestly increases clinical efficacy and reduces disease score when compared with mesalazine alone (109044). Also, a meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, shows that taking high- or low-dose vitamin D for up to 1 year reduces the rate of relapse when compared with control (98915). These findings are limited because of the heterogeneity of the included studies.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for dementia.\nA large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D 2800 IU daily, starting at gestational week 24 and continuing until one week after birth, reduces the risk of the child developing croup by 3 years of age by 40% when compared with olive oil as placebo. This risk reduction did not change after adjusting for the use of omega-3 fatty acids 2.4 grams daily, as well as for concomitant persistent wheeze and/or lower respiratory tract infections (109304).\nless\nUrinary incontinence. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial in middle-aged, but not older, adults with urinary incontinence.\nClinical research in middle-aged premenopausal females with stress urinary incontinence and low vitamin D status shows that taking vitamin D 5000 IU once weekly for 12 weeks has a moderate to large beneficial effect on the severity of incontinence and quality of life when compared with placebo. Kegel exercises were performed by all participants (109736). However, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to be beneficial for reducing urinary incontinence in older adults. In older females and males, a large clinical trial shows that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily for 5 years does not reduce the incidence or progression of urinary incontinence when compared with placebo (109738, 109741). In older males with low vitamin D status, vitamin D supplementation may actually increase some types of incontinence (109738).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of UTIs in children.\nA meta-analysis of 13 small observational studies in children suggests that lower levels of vitamin D are associated with 2.8-fold greater odds of UTI when compared with higher vitamin D levels. Further, this analysis shows that vitamin D deficiency in children is linked to 5.5-fold greater odds of UTI when compared with normal vitamin D levels (112030).\nless\nUrticaria. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of urticaria.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that having urticaria is associated with a slightly lower vitamin D blood level and a greater likelihood of vitamin D deficiency when compared with individuals without urticaria. In addition, a meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials shows that taking vitamin D at an average daily dose of at least 4100 IU has a modest effect on the severity of urticaria symptoms (106115). Pooled data from 2 clinical studies in adults with chronic urticaria shows that taking vitamin D for 12 weeks, either as cholecalciferol 60,000 IU every 2 weeks or as alfacalcidol, 0.25 mcg once daily, reduces pruritus severity when compared with placebo (115587).\nless\nUterine fibroids. Low vitamin D status is associated with uterine fibroids and some clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D may modestly decrease the size of uterine fibroids.\nTwo meta-analyses of 5 clinical studies in premenopausal adults with uterine fibroids shows that taking vitamin D, either 50,000 IU weekly or biweekly for 8-12 weeks or 1000 IU daily for 1 year, decreases fibroid size when compared with placebo or no treatment (113577, 115573). One of the meta-analyses found a 5.7% difference in fibroid size between vitamin D and control (115573).\n\nObservational research also suggests that vitamin D status is associated with uterine fibroids. Specifically, meta-analyses of a total 23 observational studies suggest that individuals with uterine fibroids have lower serum vitamin D levels and a 3.7-times higher odds of vitamin D deficiency (115573).\nless\nVaginal atrophy. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for vaginal atrophy. There is limited evidence on the topical use of vitamin D in vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal adults or patients taking tamoxifen.\nA small cross-sectional study in postmenopausal adults has found that taking a vitamin D supplement for at least one year improves the maturation index of superficial vaginal wall cells when compared with those who do not take vitamin D. However, symptoms of vaginal atrophy were not different between groups (16879). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for vaginal atrophy due to tamoxifen. A small clinical trial in females with breast cancer using tamoxifen shows that receiving vitamin D 1000 IU vaginal suppositories daily for 8 weeks improves maturation index of vaginal walls and self-reported symptoms when compared with placebo (99773).\nless\nVertigo. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with vertigo.\nAn analysis of observational research suggests that lower serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a higher risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) when compared with higher vitamin D levels (114579). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of BPPV in individuals with low vitamin D levels.\n\nVitamin D has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of BPPV. A large clinical study in adults with recurrent BPPV shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU and calcium 500 mg twice daily for one year reduces the risk of recurrence by 27% when compared with no treatment. The number needed to treat to prevent vertigo was 4 (103681). It is unclear if this benefit is due to vitamin D, calcium, or the combination.\nless\nVitiligo. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin D for vitiligo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this condition.\nWarts. Although there is interest in using topical vitamin D derivatives for warts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin D for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that supplement labels list vitamin D content in units of micrograms (mcg). To convert from International Units (IU) to mcg, divide the IUs by a factor of 40. To convert from mcg to IUs, multiply the mcg amount by a factor of 40 (98237).\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D based on age is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily in those 1-70 years of age and 800 IU (20 mcg) daily in those 71 years and older. For those pregnant or lactating, the RDA is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily (17506). The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends vitamin D 400-800 IU (10-20 mcg) daily for adults under age 50, and 800-1000 IU (20-25 mcg) daily for older adults (16120).\n\nThe current RDA assumes that vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) are equivalent; however, some evidence indicates that vitamin D2 is less than one-third as potent as vitamin D3 and that vitamin D3 is more effective in improving vitamin D status (15263, 15264, 107228). Therefore, many experts now recommend using vitamin D supplements containing vitamin D3 in order to meet these intake levels (15263, 15264).\n\nRecommendations for supplemental vitamin D doses vary greatly. In general, patients should not exceed the tolerable upper limit of 4000 IU daily, unless advised by a healthcare provider. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nAdvise patients that vitamin D can be taken with or without food. When consumed with a low-fat meal, absorption of vitamin D is up to 20% higher than when consumed with a high-fat meal or no meal. However, this increased absorption does not correlate with a sustained increase in serum vitamin D levels (97302).\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is as follows: 1-18 years of age, 600 IU (15 mcg) daily; pregnant and lactating girls, 600 IU (15 mcg) daily. For infants ages 0-12 months, an adequate intake (AI) level of 400 IU (10 mcg) is recommended (17506). Avoid doses above the tolerable upper limit (UL), unless recommended by a healthcare provider. The ULs for children are as follows: 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily for those 0-6 months of age, 1500 IU (37.5 mcg) daily for those 6-12 months of age, 2500 IU (62.5 mcg) daily for those 1-3 years of age, 3000 IU (75 mcg) daily for those 4-8 years of age, and 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for those 9 years and older (17506). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics increased the recommended minimum daily intake of vitamin D to 400 IU (10 mcg) daily for all infants and children, including adolescents (16614). Advise parents not to use vitamin D liquids dosed as 400 IU (10 mcg) per drop. Giving one dropperful or mL by mistake can deliver 10,000 IU (250 mcg) daily.\nStandardization & Formulation\nVitamin D used in clinical research has included oral, topical, and injectable formulations. Also, inactivated, activated, and synthetic forms of vitamin D have been used in clinical research. Inactivated or unmetabolized forms of vitamin D have included cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) (11819, 11820, 11821). Activated forms of vitamin D have included alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and calcifediol (11818, 11821, 11823, 39045, 83933, 83955). Synthetic or man-made forms of vitamin D have included dihydrotachysterol, calcipotriene, maxacalcitol, and paricalcitol (11818, 11820, 11822, 84325).\n\nSome specific oral vitamin D products used in clinical research include Hydroferol (Lab Juventus), a brand of calcifediol (11825); and Rocaltrol (Roche SA), a brand of calcitriol (11825). In one clinical trial, oral vitamin D was administered via gravity-metered dropper bottles to deliver a consistent dosage (Ddrops Co, Woodbridge, ON, Canada) (91340).\n\nTopically, vitamin D has been used in clinical research alone or in combination with corticosteroids. Daivobet/Dovobet, a specific product used in clinical research, contains calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (22283).\n\nIn a survey of 67 multivitamins available in England for children ages 12 years and younger, 25% to 36% of the multivitamins provided at least 400 IU vitamin D daily. About 57% to 67% of multivitamins with a claim involving 'healthy bones' contained at least vitamin D 400 IU (98924).",

This protein is stimulated by vitamin D, which may therefore increase aluminum absorption (11595, 11597, 22916). This mechanism may contribute to increased aluminum levels and toxicity in people with renal failure, when they take vitamin D and aluminum-containing phosphate binders chronically (11529, 11596, 11597).\nless\nATORVASTATIN (Lipitor)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nVitamin D might reduce absorption of atorvastatin.\nA small, low-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin D reduces levels of atorvastatin and its active metabolites by up to 55%. However, while atorvastatin levels decreased, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels did not substantially change (16828). Atorvastatin is metabolized in the gut by CYP3A4 enzymes, and researchers theorized that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4, causing reduced levels of atorvastatin. However, this proposed mechanism was not specifically studied.\nless\nCALCIPOTRIENE (Dovonex)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTaking calcipotriene with vitamin D increases the risk for hypercalcemia.\nCalcipotriene is a vitamin D analog used topically for psoriasis. It can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to cause systemic effects, including hypercalcemia (15). Theoretically, combining calcipotriene with vitamin D supplements might increase the risk of hypercalcemia.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nVitamin D might induce CYP3A4 enzymes and reduce the bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates.\nThere is some concern that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4. In vitro research suggests that vitamin D induces CYP3A4 transcription. Additionally, observational research has found that increased UV light exposure and serum vitamin D levels are associated with decreased serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, while no association between UV light exposure or vitamin D levels and levels of mycophenolic acid, a non-CYP3A4 substrate, was found (110539). A small, low-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin D reduces levels of the CYP3A4 substrate atorvastatin and its active metabolites by up to 55%; however, the clinical effects of atorvastatin were not reduced (16828). While researchers theorized that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4, this proposed mechanism was not specifically studied.\nless\nDIGOXIN (Lanoxin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can increase the risk of arrhythmia from digoxin.\nHigh doses of vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias with digoxin (15). Avoid vitamin D doses above the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU daily for adults) and monitor serum calcium levels in people taking vitamin D and digoxin concurrently.\nless\nDILTIAZEM (Cardizem, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can reduce the therapeutic effects of diltiazem for arrhythmia.\nHigh doses of vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can reduce the effectiveness of verapamil in atrial fibrillation (10574). Theoretically this could also occur with diltiazem. Avoid vitamin D doses above the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU daily for adults) and monitor serum calcium levels in people taking vitamin D and diltiazem concurrently.\nless\nTHIAZIDE DIURETICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, taking thiazide diuretics and high-dose vitamin D can increase the risk of hypercalcemia.\nThiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion, which could lead to hypercalcemia if vitamin D supplements are taken concurrently (3072, 11541, 69580). This has been reported in people being treated with vitamin D for hypoparathyroidism, and also in elderly people with normal parathyroid function who were taking a thiazide, vitamin D, and calcium-containing antacids daily (11539, 11540).\nless\nVERAPAMIL (Calan, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nHypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can reduce the therapeutic effects of verapamil for arrhythmia.\nHypercalcemia due to high doses of vitamin D can reduce the effectiveness of verapamil in atrial fibrillation (10574).

            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCALCIUM\nVitamin D may increase the absorption of calcium in some people.\nTaking vitamin D along with calcium increases active absorption of calcium in the small intestine (7555). One clinical study shows that vitamin D supplementation increases true fractional calcium absorption in postmenopausal adults (98903). However, this does not seem to apply to premenopausal adults. In another clinical study in healthy young females, adding vitamin D up to 2400 IU daily to calcium did not improve absorption of calcium (98897). Theoretically, excessive intake of vitamin D and calcium might increase the risk of hypercalcemia in some people.\nless\nMAGNESIUM\nTheoretically, vitamin D might increase the absorption of magnesium.\nThe protein that transports calcium across the intestinal wall can also bind and transport magnesium. This protein is stimulated by vitamin D, which may therefore increase magnesium absorption (11595, 11598). In people with low vitamin D and magnesium levels, taking vitamin D may improve magnesium status (11599). In people with normal magnesium levels, this effect does not seem to be significant, possibly because urinary magnesium excretion also increases (11598).\nless",

            "Nutrient Depletions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking carbamazepine for 6 month or longer might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nCarbamazepine increases hepatic metabolism of vitamin D to inactive compounds, thereby reducing calcium absorption (2675, 4430, 4431). Hypocalcemia and osteomalacia have occurred, especially with prolonged therapy, concurrent use of other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, or when other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency are present (2675, 4475, 10578). Patients taking carbamazepine for 6 months or more may need vitamin D and calcium supplements. Doses of vitamin D needed range from 400-4000 IU daily (10578). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nCHOLESTYRAMINE (Questran)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHigh-dose or prolonged therapy with cholestyramine might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nCholestyramine can reduce absorption of vitamin D. Occasionally this leads to osteomalacia, usually in patients receiving cholestyramine in doses above 32 grams daily, or prolonged therapy over 2 years, and with additional risk factors such as ileal resection or primary biliary cirrhosis, which deplete the bile acids needed for vitamin D absorption (4458, 5655, 5809, 5838). Supplements of vitamin D, and sometimes calcium, are necessary in these patients. Use of cholestyramine (24 grams daily) for treatment of hyperlipidemia in otherwise healthy men doesn't seem to affect vitamin D and calcium levels, and supplements aren't necessary (2672).\nless\nCIMETIDINE (Tagamet)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCimetidine might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nCimetidine inhibits an enzyme involved in conversion of vitamin D to its active form in the liver. However, it does not affect formation of active vitamin D metabolites in the kidneys. Clinically significant vitamin D depletion is not likely, except in people with other risk factors such as liver or kidney disease (11531, 11532, 22917).\nless\nCOLESTIPOL (Colestid)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHigh-dose or prolonged therapy with colestipol might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nColestipol can reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D. This doesn't seem to be clinically significant when up to 20 grams daily is used for up to 2 years (4460, 4461). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nCorticosteroids might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nCorticosteroids, in daily doses equivalent to 7.5 mg or more of prednisone, cause significant bone loss, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. The severity increases with duration of therapy. Although this is due mainly to disturbances in calcium homeostasis and bone formation, rather than vitamin D depletion, supplements of vitamin D are helpful to improve calcium absorption. Advise people taking corticosteroids in doses equivalent to prednisone 7.5 mg daily or more for 6 months or longer to maintain a daily calcium intake of 1500 mg, and to take a daily supplement of vitamin D 800 IU. Serum calcium should be monitored regularly (1832). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nEFAVIRENZ (Sustiva)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nEfavirenz might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nEfavirenz-based antiretroviral regimens can reduce plasma levels of vitamin D. The reduction in vitamin D levels occurs within the first 6 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, with no subsequent reductions seen between 6 and 12 months after therapy initiation (97294). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nHEPARIN\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nHeparin might reduce conversion of vitamin D to its active form.\nUnfractionated heparin is associated with reduced bone density and osteoporotic fractures, especially when doses of at least 15,000 IU daily are used for 3 months or longer (10577, 10594, 10595, 10596). This is primarily due to direct effects of heparin on bone (increased resorption and reduced bone formation), but metabolism of vitamin D to its active form is also reduced (10577, 10593, 10597). Although it's not clear whether vitamin D and calcium supplements prevent bone loss associated with heparin, people needing heparin therapy for several months should maintain their recommended daily intakes of vitamin D and calcium, using supplements if necessary. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nLOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT HEPARINS (LMWHs)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nLMWH might reduce conversion of vitamin D to its active form.\nReduced bone density has been reported with LMWHs, but probably to a lesser extent than with unfractionated heparin (10593, 10598, 10599, 11555). The effect is primarily due to direct effects of heparins on bone (increased resorption and reduced bone formation), but metabolism of vitamin D to its active form is also reduced (10577, 10593, 10597). Although it's not clear whether vitamin D and calcium supplements prevent bone loss associated with LMWH, people needing therapy with LMWH for several months should maintain their recommended daily intakes of vitamin D and calcium, using supplements if necessary.

However, occasional or short-term use of mineral oil isn't likely to have a clinically significant effect.\nless\nORLISTAT (Xenical, Alli)\nDepletion Rating\nMAJOR\nA supplement is needed for most patients.\nOrlistat decreases absorption and blood levels of vitamin D.\nOrlistat decreases absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin D, reducing plasma levels in some patients (1730, 9595, 10570). The manufacturer recommends that patients take a multivitamin supplement containing all fat-soluble vitamins, separating the dosing time by at least 2 hours from orlistat (1730).\nless\nPHENOBARBITAL (Luminal)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking phenobarbital for 6 month or longer might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nPhenobarbital increases hepatic metabolism of vitamin D to inactive compounds, thereby reducing calcium absorption (2675, 4430, 4431). Hypocalcemia and osteomalacia have occurred, especially with prolonged therapy, concurrent use of other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, or when other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency are present (2675, 4475, 10578). Patients taking phenobarbital for 6 months or more may need vitamin D and calcium supplements. Doses of vitamin D needed vary from 400-4000 IU daily (10578). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking phenytoin for 6 months or longer might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nPhenytoin increases hepatic metabolism of vitamin D to inactive compounds, thereby reducing calcium absorption (2675, 4430, 4431). Hypocalcemia and osteomalacia have occurred, especially with prolonged therapy, concurrent use of other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, or when other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency are present (2675, 4475, 10578). Patients taking phenytoin for 6 months or more may need vitamin D and calcium supplements. Doses of vitamin D needed vary from 400-4000 IU daily (10578). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nRIFAMPIN (Rifadin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nRifampin might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nRifampin increases hepatic metabolism of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, reducing its plasma levels (11561, 11562, 11563). This can contribute to osteomalacia after prolonged therapy (>1 year), especially if vitamin D intake is low (11562, 11564). However, if isoniazid (INH, Nydrazid) is taken concurrently with rifampin there doesn't seem to be any change in vitamin D status (11561, 11563). This may be because the enzyme-inducing effects on rifampin are canceled out by the enzyme-inhibiting effects of isoniazid (11563, 11565). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless\nSTIMULANT LAXATIVES\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nProlonged therapy with stimulant laxatives might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nProlonged use of high doses of stimulant laxatives can reduce dietary vitamin D and calcium absorption, leading to hypocalcemia and osteomalacia (11530). Advise patients to limit stimulant laxatives to short-term use of recommended doses.\nless\nSUNSCREENS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nFrequent use of sunscreen might reduce blood levels of vitamin D.\nFrequent and extensive application of sunscreens can reduce vitamin D synthesis in the skin and plasma levels (11507, 11508, 11509). There is increasing concern that overuse of sunscreen can contribute to vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of some kinds of cancer (12992, 12993). Tell patients that brief sun exposure is not likely dangerous and helps maintain adequate vitamin D levels. For longer exposures, recommend use of sunscreen to protect the skin. Advise people to maintain the recommended dietary intake of vitamin D. Consider supplements for people with minimal sun exposure and poor dietary intake (12992). For information on foods that are rich in vitamin D, see our chart.\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nVitamin D intoxication can occur when vitamin D supplements are taken in excessive doses (10142, 17506). Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, azotemia, and anemia (10142, 110831). Other symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include osteoporosis in adults, decreased growth in children, weight loss, anemia, calcific conjunctivitis, photophobia, metastatic calcification, pancreatitis, generalized vascular calcification, and seizures. Rarely, people develop hypertension and psychosis. Lab values of urinary calcium, phosphate, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase concentrations might increase (10142).\n\nThere are two cases of vitamin D toxicity in 16-year-old males due to the inclusion of high-dose vitamin D in a creatine powder. Although vitamin D was not included on the label, the powder contained an estimated 425,000 IU per serving due to a manufacturing error. One patient consumed three servings daily for 5 days and the other consumed four servings daily for 1 week, followed by one serving daily for 3 weeks. Both patients developed acute kidney injury and hypercalcemia. Initial symptoms included fatigue, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 1910 nmol/L and 1380 nmol/L (109739). In one case, a 3-year old male who received vitamin D 13,150 IU daily for an undefined time period developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), hypertensive emergency, acute kidney injury, hypercalcemia, and respiratory failure requiring hospitalization (115572).\nTreatment\nTreatment for vitamin D toxicity may include intravenous hydration, calcitonin, and pamidronate (109739).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe two forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, are well absorbed. However, cholecalciferol appears to be more efficient in raising 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels, which is the best measure of vitamin D status (11937, 11938, 15263, 15264, 16119). Each mcg of cholecalciferol daily seems to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations by an average of 0.78 ng/mL. Ergocalciferol yields lower increases (84652, 84657). In healthy adults, the bioavailability of vitamin D from fortified food appears to be equivalent to the bioavailability of vitamin D from supplements (84246). The bioavailability of supplemental vitamin D can be affected by the accompanying beverage. When taken with milk or water, the bioavailability of cholecalciferol is greater than when taken with apple juice (110826). The bioavailability of supplemental vitamin D might also be affected by its formulation. Pharmacokinetic research in healthy adults shows that a micellar carrier-based microencapsulated vitamin D3 supplement has around 6-fold greater absorption, based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, when compared with standard liquid vitamin D3 supplements, but only at doses of 1000 IU daily. Absorption of the 2500 IU daily dose is similar between formulations (114585).\nDistribution\nDietary vitamin D is transported differently than vitamin D produced in the skin following exposure to the sun. Dietary vitamin D is transported primarily by chylomicron, which allows vitamin D to be distributed to peripheral tissues. If not taken up by peripheral tissue, vitamin D is transported to the liver, where it is converted to calcitriol. Vitamin D produced in the skin is transported on vitamin D binding protein (DBP) (93003).\nMetabolism\nBoth ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are biologically inert and require hydroxylation in the body to form the active metabolite, calcitriol (7555, 16890). Vitamin D hydroxylation first appears to occur in the liver (84242, 84461). Then hydroxylation of vitamin D to calcitriol occurs in the kidneys. People with chronic renal failure may require forms of vitamin D that don't require renal hydroxylation, such as calcitriol, dihydrotachysterol, or calcifediol (7555). In people with granulomatous disorders such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and histoplasmosis, vitamin D metabolism is disturbed. Vitamin D is converted to calcitriol by activated macrophages trapped in the pulmonary alveoli and granulomatous inflammation, in addition to the kidneys. This may increase the risk of hypercalcemia (7555, 11881).\nExcretion\nVitamin D may be cleared more rapidly in certain disease states such as diabetes, HIV, and cancer (84226).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. The term vitamin D refers to several forms of vitamin D. There are 2 forms that are physiologically important, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Ergocalciferol comes from ergosterol, a plant sterol, and yeast. Cholecalciferol is synthesized in the skin via 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol precursor. Both ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are biologically inert and require hydroxylation in the body to form the active metabolite, calcitriol (7555, 16890). Since the early 1900s, ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol have been considered to be equally potent and effective in humans. However, more recently, research shows that cholecalciferol is significantly more potent than ergocalciferol and is more effective at improving total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (11937, 11938, 15263, 15264, 16119, 107228). Ergocalciferol appears to be less than one-third the potency of cholecalciferol (11937, 11938, 15263, 15264, 16119). A blood concentration of 20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D is considered the level to meet the bodily needs of 97.5% of the population. Lower amounts are usually considered a 'deficiency'. Higher concentrations of 32 ng/mL are preferred (15638, 93945). Most laboratories consider the \"normal\" range to be 20 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL (16119). Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Dietary sources include eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D and fatty fish such as herrings, mackerel, sardines, and tuna. In the US, Canada, and many other countries, the main source of dietary vitamin D is fortified milk and other foods. However, these are relatively minor sources of vitamin D (7555).\n\nBrief exposure to sunlight (about 25% of the amount of time it would take to cause light pinkness to the skin) is the most efficient way to get vitamin D (11935). Skin exposure to the sun provides as much as 80% to 90% of the body's vitamin D stores (7133). Full-body sun exposure can lead to the synthesis of as much as 10,000 units of vitamin D daily (6855). Vitamin D is stored in body fat for use during periods without sun exposure. Sun exposure is an easy, reliable way for most patients to get vitamin D. Exposure of the hands, face, arms, and legs to sunlight two to three times a week for the amount of time equal to about 25% of what it would take to develop a mild sunburn will cause the skin to produce adequate vitamin D. Exposure time will vary with skin type, season, and time of day (12992). Conversely, excessive sun exposure causes photodegradation of vitamin D produced in the skin, limiting the risk of vitamin D toxicity from such exposure (11936).\n\nVitamin D insufficiency, based on blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL, is common in the northern latitudes such as Canada and the northern half of the US (12995). Interestingly, these levels also occur in as many as 40% of older people even in sunny climates such as South Florida (15637). Prevalence of vitamin D considered insufficient and deficient among young, healthy people appears to be increasing, possibly because of excessive use of sunscreens (12995). Exposure to sunlight might not always be sufficient to cause vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Sunlight intensity is dependent on latitude, altitude, season, cloud cover, ozone levels and other factors. During winter in some northern latitudes (e.g., northern US and Canada), little, if any, vitamin D3 is produced in the skin. For example, in Boston there is insufficient UV-B energy for vitamin D production in the skin for 4 months of the year. In Edmonton, the skin can't produce vitamin D for 5 months of the year (12998, 12999, 13000). Underway submariners, who get no sunlight for extended periods of time, have lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and evidence of bone resorption and turnover, even when supplemented with 400 IU daily of cholecalciferol. The capacity of UV-B mediated vitamin D synthesis is huge. Just 6 days of casual sunlight exposure without sunscreen can make up for 49 days of no sunlight exposure (12998).\n\nSkin pigmentation affects vitamin D synthesis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. A light-skinned person in a bathing suit who is not tanned would receive about 10,000 to 20,000 IU of cholecalciferol from 10-12 minutes of peak July summer sun in Boston. For a darker-skinned person, such as Asian Indian, getting this dose of vitamin D could take perhaps 30 minutes of exposure, and, for a very darkly pigmented African American, it could require 120 minutes of exposure (12997). The skin pigment melanin competes with vitamin D precursors in the skin for photons from UV-B light (6857). When serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are adjusted for percent body fat, White females have serum levels 1.3-1.9 times higher than Black females (16887). This also affects vitamin D in breast milk. For example, breast milk from Black females is generally lower in vitamin D content than that from White females (35 units/L compared with 68 units/L, respectively) (6857). Black infants who are exclusively breast-fed are therefore at risk for vitamin D deficiency and rickets, even if they live in sunny climates such as the southern US (6857). Vitamin D supplements may be needed by elderly people with limited sun exposure, people living in northern latitudes, dark-skinned people, Asian Indians living in the western hemisphere, as well as people with gastrointestinal diseases leading to malabsorption of vitamin D from the diet (6855, 7133).\n\nVitamin D deficiency, based on blood levels <20 ng/mL, is particularly common in adults over age 50 years. More than 50% of North American females receiving therapy to prevent or treat osteoporosis have inadequate vitamin D stores (12996). Factors such as lack of exposure to sunlight, reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D, lower dietary intake, impaired intestinal absorption, chronic kidney disease, and reduced metabolism to active forms of vitamin D by the kidneys increase with aging (11919, 16883). Also, vitamin D receptors seem to decrease with age (11921). The risk for vitamin D deficiency in elderly adults (>65 years) is very high (12995, 12996). The risk for severe vitamin D deficiency is even greater with advanced age. A survey of 104 adults older than 98 years old found blood levels of vitamin D were detectable in only 5 adults. This correlates to a blood level of less than 2 ng/mL (16874).\n\nBody mass index seems to affect vitamin D status. There is some evidence that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of >25kg/m2 have reduced serum vitamin D levels and/or reduced bioavailability of vitamin D from both cutaneous synthesis and gastrointestinal absorption (6856, 110817). In response to similar UV-B exposures, the increase in serum vitamin D levels can be 57% less in people with obesity than in those with lower BMIs (6856). In individuals with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2, taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU for 5 years modestly reduces the response to supplementation when compared with individuals with a BMI of up to 25 kg/m2 (110817). The content of vitamin D precursors in the skin are similar in both groups, suggesting that vitamin D synthesis is not affected by BMI, but that vitamin D is possibly sequestered into body fat, reducing its availability (6856).\n\nThe main function of vitamin D is to regulate serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Vitamin D enhances the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of calcium, primarily in the duodenum and jejunum, and phosphorus, particularly in the jejunum and ilium (7555). In the absence of adequate vitamin D, only 10% to 15% of calcium is absorbed and phosphorus absorption is only 60%. In the presence of vitamin D, calcium absorption increases to 30% to 40% and phosphorus absorption to 80% (16890). Vitamin D can increase serum calcium levels, but this effect is modest in healthy people in doses less than 1200 IU daily. If dietary intake of calcium is inadequate, calcitriol in combination with parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium stores from bone. Calcitriol also appears to have effects in the brain, heart, pancreas, mononuclear cells, activated lymphocytes, and skin, but its exact physiologic role is unclear (7555).\n\nThe hydroxylation of vitamin D to calcitriol occurs in the kidneys. People with chronic renal failure may require forms of vitamin D such as calcitriol, dihydrotachysterol, or calcifediol that don't require renal hydroxylation (7555).\n\nIn people with granulomatous disorders such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and histoplasmosis, vitamin D metabolism is disturbed. Vitamin D is converted to calcitriol by activated macrophages trapped in the pulmonary alveoli and granulomatous inflammation, in addition to the kidneys. This may increase the risk of hypercalcemia (7555, 11881).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlthough some individual clinical trials disagree (110812, 110828), an overarching meta-analysis of 23 individual meta-analyses shows that vitamin D supplementation in adults reduces serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde. However, there were no effects on levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or total antioxidant capacity (109731). Meta-analyses of clinical studies in postmenopausal adults, as well as adults with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19, shows that taking vitamin D reduces CRP levels when compared with control (113583, 115575, 115581). Clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis, allergic rhinitis, or chronic urticaria shows that vitamin D modestly reduces levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, CRP, and IL-6 and increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interferon gamma and IL-10 (109044, 112483, 11587). A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with asthma also shows that taking vitamin D increases levels of IL-10 (114505). It is unclear whether these benefits are sustained in long-term studies. One large clinical trial shows that taking cholecalciferol alone or with omega-3 fatty acids reduces serum levels of CRP by 19% after 2 years, with no continued evidence of benefit after 4 years. Also, the levels of other inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators were not affected (110815). Vitamin D supplementation has also been found to reduce tissue and salivary levels of interferon-gamma (114586).\nAnti-malarial effects\nA meta-analysis of animal research suggests that vitamin D improves survival after Plasmodium infection. Researchers theorize that the benefits of vitamin D in animal models of malaria relate to its anti-inflammatory and immunologic effects (112023).\nAnti-oxidant effects\nThere is interest in vitamin D for its potential anti-oxidant effects. Clinical research in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that vitamin D supplementation increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces malondialdehyde when compared with a control (114584).\nAnti-sepsis effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of case-control studies shows that neonates and children with sepsis are more likely to have low serum levels of vitamin D than non-septic patients. However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that children with low serum vitamin D levels (< 20 ng/mL) do not have an increased risk of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (105722). It is unknown if treating low serum levels of vitamin D will prevent sepsis or improve outcomes in patients with sepsis.\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in whether supplementing with vitamin D can impact glycemic indices in diabetes. Vitamin D impacts the function of beta-cells by mediating calcium flux. Population research found that a lower vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to higher vitamin D levels (15630, 16713, 84594). Some preliminary clinical research suggests that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to impairment of insulin secretion and insulin action (83898). Other clinical research in patients mostly without diabetes shows that supplementing with calcium 1000 mg or more daily in conjunction with vitamin D 2000 IU or more daily lowers fasting blood glucose and reduces insulin levels and insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (100893).\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem that vitamin D supplements can prevent or treat diabetes. Most evidence suggests that vitamin D does not significantly improve glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes with adequate vitamin D status, but it may help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes when given to infants during early childhood (10139, 83898, 84225, 84488, 84594, 84636, 84645, 84808, 91347, 96403)(107210, 110822). Although supplementation with oral vitamin D, alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids, for 8 weeks actually seems to increase glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by about 0.2% or 0.4%, respectively, in patients who are vitamin D-deficient and mostly healthy when compared with control, it should be noted that more patients receiving supplementation had prediabetes at baseline when compared with control (107192).\nBone effects\nSince vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and for bone health, it is used to help prevent osteoporosis. Early research suggested serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) of at least 16 ng/mL for optimal bone health (6854). This is supported by the dietary reference intakes (93945). However, some researchers suggest serum levels of 28 to 32 ng/mL may be necessary for bone health (13276). When intake of calcium is low in healthy elderly females, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) seems to be more biologically active and a more important determinant of gut calcium absorption than calcitriol (10141). Osteopenia in elderly males also seems to correlate with circulating levels of vitamin D and vitamin K (7132). There is also concern that high dose vitamin D might result in lower bone mineral density (BMD); however, research has not shown consistent results. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking vitamin D for 3 years at a dose of 4000 IU daily or 10000 IU daily seems to result in lower radial BMD when compared with control of taking 400 IU daily. Tibial BMD was lower only with the 10 000 IU dose when compared with control. However, there were no differences between groups in BMD of the radius or tibia (100894).\nCancer effects\nThere is some epidemiological evidence that people with vitamin D deficiency might be at an increased risk of colon, breast, and prostate cancer (7555). Other evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a decreased risk of cancer (16101). Some researchers think vitamin D might have antiproliferative effects in these cancers (6855). Prostate cancer has been associated with decreased sun exposure and vitamin D receptor activity (12994). Some evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a role in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (16882).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D is thought to play a role in cardiovascular disease by affecting inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins. Vitamin D might also decrease cardiac and vascular remodeling through suppression of the rennin gene and suppression of parathyroid hormone (14614, 16620, 16621, 16622). Some research shows that vitamin D supplementation might also suppress macrophage cholesterol uptake and decrease foam cell formation (16873). Clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking vitamin D with calcium reduces serum aldosterone levels, but does not alter serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), or galectin-3 (97300). There is also interest in whether vitamin D might reduce progression of atherosclerosis. However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation has no effect on measures of endothelial function such as flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, and central augmentation index (103663, 103664).\n\nEvidence in humans also suggests that taking vitamin D may result in a reduction in blood pressure. However, not all studies agree. It is possible that blood pressure lowering effects associated with vitamin D are related to direct effects on the vascular cells or a suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (84226, 84364, 84410, 84554, 84631, 84692). There is interest in whether a mega-dose of vitamin D can decrease the resting blood pressure in elderly females with hypertension, enhance post-exercise hypotension, and improve autonomic nervous modulation. A small case control study in older females with hypertension shows that taking a single dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 200,000 IU does not reduce resting blood pressure, but might reduce post-exercise systolic hypotension, and increase the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, a controversial measure of sympathovagal balance (103657).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), which involves chronic recurrent inflammation of the colon. A small clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate UC shows that receiving a single muscular injection of 7.5 mg vitamin D3 decreases serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-c, and interleukin (IL)-12p70 levels, but not IL-4 and IL-10 levels, when compared with an injection of normal saline (100898). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with UC shows that taking vitamin D modestly reduces levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and improves the repair function of intestinal mucosa (109044).\nHematologic effects\nAn observational study in patients with vitamin D deficiency has found that supplementation with vitamin D is associated with reduced platelet concentrations (107229).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to treat or prevent hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, preliminary clinical research in adults with serum vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL and a sustained virological response after hepatitis C treatment shows that taking vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 60,000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks does not reduce serum levels of hepatic fibrinogenesis markers, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and amino terminal type III procollagen peptide (P3NP), when compared with placebo. However, this study did not evaluate liver biopsies for fibrosis (105723).\nHormonal effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin D to increase testosterone levels in males and improve the hormone profile in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, a small clinical study in middle-aged males with low testosterone levels shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of serum total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, or luteinizing hormone (103660). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces total testosterone levels but does not modify levels of sex-hormone binding globulin or free androgen index (114584).\nImmunologic effects\nVitamin D may have immunologic activity. In models of autoimmune disease, vitamin D seems to act as an immunosuppressant. This might explain why increased vitamin D intake is associated with a lower risk of autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) (12206, 84529, 107184). Additionally, people with autoimmune disease seem to have lower serum vitamin D levels than healthy controls (112482, 112483). Some evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation during infancy might prevent the development of type 1 diabetes later on in life. Type 1 diabetes is believed to be an autoimmune disease. Vitamin D supplementation might inhibit an autoimmune reaction that targets the beta cells of the pancreas (10139, 16886).\n\nVitamin D has also shown other immunologic effects. Some research shows that CD4+ T cell counts are lower in patients with tuberculosis and low vitamin D status when compared with those with normal vitamin D status, and that supplementation with vitamin D as calcitriol increases these T cell counts (109045). Another study in patients with allergic rhinitis suggests that vitamin D reduces CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio and increases CD8+ serum levels (112483). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, taking vitamin D increases neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, decreases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and alters the activity of B cells (109047).\nNeurologic effects\nA small meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows that taking vitamin D improves sleep quality by 2 points on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) when compared with control (108433).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is interest in using vitamin D for improving respiratory disorders such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and asthma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are associated with pulmonary function. People with higher levels seem to have greater pulmonary function as measured by FEV1 compared to people with lower levels. It is theorized that vitamin D might be involved in remodeling of lung tissue (14252, 17685). Vitamin D might also improve lung function by decreasing immune-mediated inflammation in the airway (14253, 84505, 84613).\n\nEvidence from a population based study suggests patients with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are 27% to 55% more likely to have upper respiratory tract infections compared to patients with normal levels (16830), though clinical research has not shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of acute respiratory infections in older adults (114506). It is also not known if taking vitamin D supplements improves pulmonary function. Vitamin D deficiency has been commonly reported in children with mild-to-moderate asthma and is also associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbations that are severe. Vitamin D receptor variants have been associated with asthma in some population studies. Additionally, population studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels are correlated with increased inhaled corticosteroid needs in children (17685).\nSkeletal muscle effects\nVitamin D deficiency causes muscle pain and proximal muscle weakness with symptoms such as sensation of heaviness in the legs, rapid fatigue, and problems with climbing stairs and getting up from a chair. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that people with low vitamin D levels, considered to be less than or equal to 20 ng/mL, have more osteoarthritis pain and disability than people with adequate vitamin D stores. Vitamin D deficiency also increases postural sway and affects psychomotor function (11922, 11923, 11924, 11925, 12491). Vitamin D may prevent falls by increasing muscle strength and neuromuscular function in addition to strengthening bone. It seems to increase muscle protein synthesis, possibly by activating second messengers and phosphorylation (11919, 11922). Some evidence also shows that higher serum levels of vitamin D is associated with improved lower-extremity function in people aged 60 years or older (15636). The standard dose of 400 units that is found in most multivitamin tablets appears to be too low to prevent falls or reduce fracture risk, but the optimal dose is unknown (11926, 11927, 11928). Fractures were reduced in clinical trials using 700 to 800 units of vitamin D daily (11930, 11931). Some research suggests that sufficient calcium intake along with vitamin D is necessary to prevent falls (11932).\nThyroid effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, especially when cholecalciferol is used for more than 3 months (108430).\nUterine effects\nVitamin D regulates cytochrome P450-27B1 and -24A1 enzymes, which are dysregulated in uterine fibroid disease. It also decreases growth of uterine fibroid cells, reducing expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cell proliferation nuclear antigen (113577)."

    "Vitamin E": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. In 1925, vitamin E was recognized as the fifth vitamin (85222). Due to its effects on fertility, it was named tocopherol, based on the Greek words toc and phero, which mean \"child\" and \"to bring forth,\" respectively. It occurs naturally in many foods including vegetable oils, wheat germ oil, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables (96). Vitamin E exists as two distinct chemical analogues: tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocopherols are saturated vitamin E derivatives, while tocotrienols are unsaturated vitamin E derivatives that possess an isoprenoid side chain. Each isomer may have a different role in the action of vitamin E (13504). This monograph focuses on vitamin E provided as tocopherols.\n\nWARNINGS\n\nAlthough vitamin E is an essential nutrient and is likely safe when used appropriately orally or topically, vitamin E acetate has been associated with e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI). Until more is known, inhalation of products containing vitamin E acetate is not recommended (101062).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally or topically and appropriately. Vitamin E is generally considered safe, even at doses exceeding the recommended dietary allowance (RDA); however, adverse effects are more likely to occur with higher doses. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) in healthy people is 1000 mg daily, equivalent to 1100 IU of synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 IU of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) (4668, 4681, 4713, 4714, 4844, 89234, 90067, 90069, 90072, 19206)(63244, 97075). Although there is some concern that taking vitamin E in doses of 400 IU (form unspecified) per day or higher might increase the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality from all causes (12212, 13036, 15305, 16709, 83339), most of this evidence comes from studies that included middle-aged or older patients with chronic diseases or patients from developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are prevalent.\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses. Repeated doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1000 mg daily are associated with significant side effects in otherwise healthy people (4844). ...when used intravenously in large doses. Large repeated intravenous doses of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) were associated with decreased activity of clotting factors and bleeding in one report (3074). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adults who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products, which often contain vitamin E acetate. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in most bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. Other ingredients, including THC or nicotine, were also commonly found in samples. However, priority toxicants including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable in almost all samples. While this association shows a correlation between vitamin E acetate inhalation and lung injury, a causal link has not yet been determined, and it is not clear if other toxic compounds are also involved (101061, 101062, 102970).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin E has been safely used in children in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for healthy children is: 200 mg in children aged 1-3 years, 300 mg in children aged 4-8 years, 600 mg in children aged 9-13 years, and 800 mg in children aged 14-18 years. A UL has not been established for infants up to 12 months of age (23388).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in doses above the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects (23388). ...when alpha-tocopherol is used intravenously in large doses in premature infants. Large intravenous doses of vitamin E are associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in this population (85062, 85083). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adolescents and teenagers who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Constituents in E-cigarette or vaping products with the potential to cause lung injury or impaired lung function include lipids, such as vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in all bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. No other ingredient, including THC or nicotine, was found in all samples, and other ingredients, including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable This shows that vitamin E acetate is at the primary site of lung injury. A causal link has not yet been described and it is not clear if other compounds are also involved (101061, 101062).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) during pregnancy is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older. However, maternal supplementation is not generally recommended unless dietary vitamin E falls below the RDA (4260). No serious adverse effects were reported with oral intake of 400 IU per day starting at weeks 9-22 of pregnancy in healthy patients or those at high risk for pre-eclampsia (3236, 97075), or with 600-900 IU daily during the last two months of pregnancy (4260). However, some preliminary evidence suggests that taking vitamin E supplements might be harmful when taken in early pregnancy. A case-control study found that taking a vitamin E supplement during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy is associated with a 1.7-9-fold increase in odds of congenital heart defects (16823). However, the exact amount of vitamin E consumed during pregnancy in this study is unclear. Until more is known, advise patients to avoid taking a vitamin E supplement in early pregnancy unless needed for an appropriate medical indication.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL during lactation is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older (4844).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts that exceed the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects (4844).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, vitamin E is generally well-tolerated.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular complications.\n\nInhaled: Vitamin E acetate is thought to be responsible for e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI).\nCardiovascular\nSome evidence suggests that taking vitamin E supplements, especially greater than or equal to 400 IU taken by mouth daily for over one year, might also increase the risk of mortality in non-healthy patients (12212, 13036, 15305, 16709, 83339). A population study shows that vitamin E use is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in people with a history of severe cardiovascular disease such as stroke or myocardial infarction (16709). In an analysis of clinical trials, patients who took either all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) or RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) in doses of 400 IU/day or higher had an increased risk of mortality from all causes. The risk of mortality seems to increase when higher doses are used (12212). A large-scale study also suggests that patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily have an increased risk of heart failure and heart failure-related hospitalization (13036). However, in another large scale study, taking 600 IU vitamin E every other day for 10 years did not increase the risk of heart failure in healthy females over 45 years of age (90068). There is speculation that high-dose vitamin E might disrupt the normal antioxidant balance and result in pro-oxidant rather than antioxidant effects.\n\nThere is some evidence that vitamin E in combination with simvastatin (Zocor), niacin, selenium, vitamin C, and beta-carotene might lower high density lipoprotein-2 (HDL-2) by 15%. HDL-2 is considered to be the most cardioprotective component of HDL (7388). However, vitamin E and a statin alone don't seem to negatively affect HDL (11286, 11287). In addition, vitamin E has been associated with increased triglycerides (85215). Although only certain isomers of vitamin E are included for determination of dietary requirements, all isomers are considered for determining safe intake levels. All the isomers are thought to potentially contribute to toxicity.\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, vitamin E has been associated with contact dermatitis, inflammatory reactions, and eczematous lesions (11998, 85066, 85285). Dermatitis, often associated with moisturizers containing vitamin E, has a scattered generalized distribution, is more common on the face than the hands, and is more common in females with a history of atopic dermatitis. In a retrospective analysis of results of patch tests for DL-alpha-tocopherol sensitivity, 0.9% of patients had a definite positive reaction, while over 50% had a weakly positive, non-vesicular erythematous reaction (107869).\n\nOrally, vitamin E has been associated with pruritus in one clinical trial (34596).\n\nSubcutaneously, vitamin E has been associated with reports of lipogranuloma (85188, 112331). In one case, subcutaneous injection of a specific supplement (1Super Extenze), containing mineral oil and tocopherol acetate, into the penile tissue resulted in penile disfigurement due to sclerosing lipogranuloma (85188). In another case, a 50-year-old Iranian female presented with lipogranuloma of the face, characterized by severe facial erythema, edema, and tenderness, 3 months after receiving subcutaneous injections of vitamin E to the cheeks for \"facial rejuvenation.\" The patient had noticed initial symptoms within 3 days, and her symptoms progressively worsened over time (112331).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, vitamin E supplementation has been associated with abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or flu-like symptoms (85040, 85323). Intravenously, large doses of vitamin E in premature infants are associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis (85083, 85231).\nless\nGenitourinary\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk. One large-scale population study shows that males who take a multivitamin more than 7 times per week and who also take a separate vitamin E supplement have a significantly increased risk of developing prostate cancer (15607). In a large-scale clinical trial (The SELECT trial) in males over the age of 50 years, taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily increased the risk of developing prostate cancer by 17% when compared with placebo. However, the difference in prostate cancer risk between vitamin E and placebo became significant only 3 years after patients stopped taking supplementation and were followed in an unblinded fashion. Interestingly, patients taking vitamin E plus selenium did not have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (17688).\nless\nHematologic\nHigh doses of vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding due to antagonism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and platelet aggregation. Patients with vitamin K deficiencies or taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs are at a greater risk for bleeding (4098, 4844, 11999, 34596, 34538, 34626, 34594, 112162).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nThere is concern that vitamin E might increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (16708, 34594, 34596, 108641). In one clinical study, there was a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in male smokers taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) for 5-8 years compared to those not taking vitamin E (3949). Other studies lasting from 1.4-4.5 years and using either all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) or RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) showed no significantly increased risk for stroke (2307, 3896, 3936). A meta-analysis of studies shows that vitamin E in doses of 300-800 IU daily, including both natural and synthetic forms, does not significantly affect total stroke risk. However, it significantly increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 22%. This means that there will be one additional hemorrhagic stroke for every 1250 patients taking vitamin E. In contrast to this finding, the analysis also found that vitamin E significantly reduces the risk of ischemic stroke by 10%. This means that one ischemic stroke will be prevented for every 476 patients taking vitamin E (14621). In patients with moderately severe Alzheimer disease, taking vitamin E 2000 IU for 2 years has been associated with a modest, but significant, increase in falls and episodes of syncope when compared to placebo (4635).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen inhaled, vitamin E acetate is thought to play a role in the development of e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI). Although a causal link has not yet been determined, in two case series, vitamin E acetate has been found in most bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from the primary site of lung injury in patients with EVALI, whereas no vitamin E was found in healthy control samples. Other ingredients, including THC or nicotine, were also commonly found in samples. However, priority toxicants including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable in almost all samples. EVALI has resulted in death in some patients (101062, 102970).\nless\nOther\nIn an analysis of 3 trials, taking vitamin E 400 IU with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 14-22 weeks during gestation appears to increase the risk of gestational hypertension by 30% compared to placebo in patients at risk of pre-eclampsia. However, the risk of pre-eclampsia itself was not increased (83450).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nAtaxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Oral vitamin E is effective for treating vitamin E deficiency due to the genetic disorder AVED.\nThis genetic disorder occurs when the gene that produces alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) is defective. This causes severe vitamin E deficiency. Symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and sensory loss usually appear between 4 and 18 years of age. Vitamin E supplements are used in the treatment of AVED (13498, 101437, 101438).\nless\nVitamin E deficiency. Oral vitamin E is effective for preventing or treating vitamin E deficiency and associated conditions.\nTaking vitamin E orally is effective for preventing and treating vitamin E deficiency (4844). However, vitamin E deficiency is rare in humans. It most commonly occurs in people with malabsorption disorders such as abetalipoproteinemia; cystic fibrosis; gastrectomy; hepatic-biliary tract disease including chronic cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, biliary atresia, and obstructive jaundice; in infants receiving formula with insufficient vitamin E; intestinal diseases including celiac and tropical sprue; and regional enteritis (4844, 104411).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Oral vitamin E might slow functional decline in some patients with this condition. However, it does not seem to prevent Alzheimer disease onset.\nA clinical study in patients with moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for 2 years might be similar to selegiline (Eldepryl), and superior to placebo, for slowing cognitive decline. Benefit was only apparent when outcomes were adjusted for baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. This study is limited by attrition bias, or incomplete outcome reporting (4635, 97070). Another clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol 2000 IU daily reduces the annual rate of decline in activities of daily living by 19% when compared with placebo. This translates to a delay in disease progression of 6.2 months. This is comparable to the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine) in this population. Despite these positive findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends against the use of vitamin E for the management of dementia due to the increased risk for adverse effects with the extended use of high-dose vitamin E (104823).\n\nInterestingly, the combination of vitamin E and memantine (Namenda) 20 mg per day is not superior to placebo in this population. Researchers speculate that this lack of effectiveness may be due to an interaction between vitamin E and memantine, but this proposed interaction has not been validated in research (19060, 97070).\n\nVitamin E supplementation doesn't seem to prevent Alzheimer disease or slow progression of mild cognitive impairment. Patients with mild cognitive impairment who take vitamin E 2000 IU daily for 3 years progress to Alzheimer disease at the same rate as those who take placebo (13060, 97070). Furthermore, although population research has found that greater intake of foods high in vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease (34597, 90082), taking vitamin E supplements does not seem to help. Evidence from a large clinical study that was later converted into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU orally daily does not prevent Alzheimer disease when compared with placebo in cognitively intact men (93570). However, this study is limited by the fact that the participants were well-educated and were assessed for dementia in their 60s; the prevalence of dementia is typically low in this age group (93571).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial for children with this condition.\nA small clinical study in children with beta-thalassemia and low vitamin E plasma concentrations shows that taking vitamin E orally seems to correct erythrocyte membrane abnormalities when compared with control (4642). Another small clinical trial in children 5-18 years of age with beta-thalassemia shows that taking an age-based dose of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 200-600 mg daily for 4 weeks seems to increase haptoglobin levels, suggesting reduced hemolysis, when compared with placebo (104412).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral vitamin E seems to reduce pain in adults with dysmenorrhea.\nSmall clinical studies in younger adults with primary dysmenorrhea show that taking vitamin E 200-500 IU daily, starting 2 days before menstruation and continuing through the first 3 days of bleeding for 2-4 cycles, decreases the severity and duration of pain and reduces blood loss when compared with placebo (10361, 14432, 99367). One study also shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU with fish oil provides better pain relief when compared with taking either vitamin E or omega-3 fatty acids alone (99367). A meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies, including those described above, in individuals with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin E reduces the severity of pain when compared with placebo (112170).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Oral vitamin E seems to modestly reduce exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA meta-analysis of 17 very small clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking vitamin E 300-1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks reduces markers of exercise-induced muscle damage, including creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, when compared with placebo. Vitamin E appears to be most beneficial in athletes and at doses under 500 IU daily (112160). However, a small clinical study in endurance-trained runners, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) 235 mg and vitamin C 1000 mg 2 hours prior to an exercise protocol does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness or improve markers of exercise-induced muscle damage when compared with placebo (109961).\nless\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial in patients with G6PD deficiency.\nIndividual clinical studies evaluating the use of vitamin E in patients with G6PD deficiency show mixed results (4682, 4683, 4684). However, a meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in patients with G6PD deficiency shows that taking vitamin E improves hemoglobin levels and reduces reticulocyte levels when compared with placebo in the setting of both acute and chronic hemolysis (112164).\nless\nIntracranial hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants.\nClinical research shows that giving premature neonates vitamin E orally might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage when compared with control (4655, 85074).\nless\nIntraventricular hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants. Intravenous vitamin E does not provide this benefit.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that oral, but not intravenous, administration of vitamin E can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in premature neonates when compared with control. However, it might not reduce the risk for severe (grade III-IV) intraventricular hemorrhage. Additionally, high serum levels of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants (85062).\nless\nNitrate tolerance. Oral vitamin E might reduce tolerance to nitrates.\nNitrate tolerance might involve increased vascular superoxide anion production, and antioxidants may help prevent this (4705). Clinical research in patients with ischemic heart disease shows that taking vitamin E 447-894 IU daily can help prevent nitrate tolerance when compared with placebo (4705, 11543).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral vitamin E seems to improve outcomes in patients with NASH.\nClinical studies and meta-analyses in adults with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for up to 24 months improves liver enzymes, hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and lobular inflammation (14005, 17517, 97077, 104413). Taking vitamin E 400-1200 IU in children with NASH also seems to improve liver enzyme levels after 4-10 months of treatment (89). Furthermore, a small study in patients with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 1 year seems to improve liver histology to a similar degree as taking telmisartan 40 mg daily (104405). In fact, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend taking vitamin E 800 IU daily as a first-line therapy in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH. However, vitamin E isn't recommended in NASH patients with diabetes, cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis (98130).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral vitamin E seems to improve PMS symptoms.\nClinical research in adults with PMS shows that taking vitamin E 400-600 IU daily for 3 cycles reduce subjective reports of symptoms, including anxiety, craving, and depression, when compared with placebo (4719, 4720). Another small clinical study in Japanese patients with PMS shows that taking vitamin E, as gamma-tocopherol 180 mg, twice daily for 7 days during the luteal phase of 2 consecutive cycles reduces fatigue, irritability, and leg swelling when compared with placebo (112337).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. Oral vitamin E might attenuate worsening of tardive dyskinesia in patients taking antipsychotic medications.\nSmall clinical studies suggest that taking vitamin E orally improves Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores in patients with tardive dyskinesia. It seems to be more effective in higher doses and in people who have had tardive dyskinesia for less than 5 years (3942, 3943, 3944, 3945, 3946, 3948, 85323). Both RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) and unspecified forms were used in clinical trials. However, some conflicting findings have been reported. A meta-analysis suggests that vitamin E does not improve symptoms of tardive dyskinesia when compared with placebo; however, taking vitamin E seems to prevent the deterioration of symptoms when compared with placebo (97079).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow AMD progression.\nResults from clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical trials show that vitamin E when taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants does not prevent the development (4667, 7303, 7304, 34625) or progression of AMD (34633). In contrast, taking vitamin E 400 IU orally with elemental zinc 80 mg, vitamin C 500 mg, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily does seem to be beneficial. When taken for 5 years, this combination reduces visual acuity loss and reduces the risk of progression of AMD by 25% in patients with advanced AMD (7303, 11326). A 10-year follow-up on this study confirmed these findings (90069). It is not known if this combination is beneficial for people with less advanced macular disease or for preventing AMD. Additionally, it is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow ALS progression.\nClinical research in patients with ALS shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 1490 IU daily for up to 12 months in addition to riluzole does not influence survival or motor function when compared with riluzole alone. However, these patients seem to be less likely to progress to a more severe disease state from a milder disease state (83180). Additionally, a large population study has found that dietary intake of vitamin E is not associated with risk of developing ALS (90087).\nless\nAngina. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce angina symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin E orally may have some effect on endothelial dysfunction, but does not improve angina in nonsmokers or smokers, when compared with placebo (3896, 4634, 4649, 4650, 4651, 4652).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce atherosclerosis progression.\nTaking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) orally does not appear to have any effect on atherosclerosis progression or mortality in patients with atherosclerosis when compared with placebo (3899, 3936). However, there is preliminary evidence that a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C might help prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in men, particularly smokers and cardiac transplant patients (1918).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce eczema symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU in combination with selenium daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of atopic eczema when compared with placebo or selenium alone (74456). Also, while some clinical research shows that taking 600 IU of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) daily for 60 days with vitamin D 1600 IU improves overall atopic dermatitis symptoms, pruritus, and erythema when compared with placebo, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to have this effect. However, vitamin E alone does improve hard, leathery skin symptoms and dryness when compared with placebo (84491).\nless\nBreast cancer-related hot flashes. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce hot flashes related to breast cancer.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in females who have had breast cancer when compared with placebo (454).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.\nClinical research in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that taking vitamin E orally does not prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo (4657, 85062).\nless\nCataracts. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce cataract risk.\nSome population research has found that dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing age-related cataracts (4208, 4663, 4665, 4759). However, other population research has not found this association (2395, 4664, 92902). Additionally, higher quality evidence from clinical trials and a meta-analysis consistently shows that vitamin E, taken alone or with other vitamins, does not prevent the progression of age-related cataracts or decrease vision loss when compared with control (4666, 7304, 34626). However, a meta-analysis of observational research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E is weakly associated with a 27% reduction in the odds of developing cataracts when compared with low dietary intake of vitamin E (112095).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.\nAlthough some small, low-quality clinical studies and a meta-analysis of these studies suggest that vitamin E 600 mg daily for 3 months might be beneficial for preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy induced by cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin when compared with placebo (10366, 85117, 90072), these studies have found no effect with lower doses of vitamin E or in those receiving paclitaxel chemotherapy (107862). In addition to the low methodological quality of the studies, the validity of these finding is limited by high heterogeneity, as the studies included patients with several different cancer types. Also, a large, high-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 400 mg daily is not beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathy induced by taxanes or platinum analogues when compared with placebo (101457). The American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend the use of vitamin E for the prevention or management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (101434).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce colorectal cancer risk.\nSome population research has found that intake of vitamin E and multivitamins is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (1047). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that taking vitamin E orally in combination with other vitamins might have a protective effect in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas (3954, 3956, 92903). However, higher quality evidence from larger clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical research consistently show that taking vitamin E supplements alone, or in combination with other vitamins, does not prevent colorectal cancer incidence or recurrence when compared with control (3953, 3955, 3957, 12185, 13036, 13131, 34594, 90361). Despite this conflicting research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim in 2009 regarding vitamin E and colorectal cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (102332).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce CHF symptoms or prevent CHF development.\nClinical research in adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV heart failure shows that taking vitamin E (RRR- α tocopherol) 500 IU orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve prognostic or functional indices of CHF or quality of life measurements when compared with placebo (3906). Additionally, population research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU every other day does not affect the risk of developing heart failure in healthy females 45 years or older when compared with placebo (90068).\nless\nHead and neck cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of head and neck cancer recurrence. In fact, it might increase recurrence risk.\nA large clinical trial in patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, during radiation therapy and for 3 years after the end of radiation therapy, does not reduce the risk of recurrence of the first tumor or development of a second primary tumor when compared with placebo. In fact, there is some concern that patients taking vitamin E seem to have an increased risk of tumor recurrence or a second primary tumor when compared with patients taking placebo (13055). Advise patients with head and neck cancer to avoid taking vitamin E supplements in doses of 400 IU/day or more.\nless\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Oral vitamin E during pregnancy does not seem to reduce IUGR risk.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for IUGR when compared with placebo (97075).\nless\nLiver disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce liver disease-associated mortality.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce all-cause-or liver related-mortality or morbidity in patients with liver diseases, including autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis (34608). Additional clinical research in male smokers over 50 years old shows that taking vitamin E 75 IU orally, alone or with beta-carotene 20 mg orally, daily for 5-8 years does not reduce the risk of mortality due to chronic liver disease when compared with placebo (91383).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for oral leukoplakia in male smokers.\nAlthough there is some conflicting evidence (3951, 4708), the largest randomized controlled trial indicates that supplementation with all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-7 years has no effect on the incidence of oral lesions in male cigarette smokers when compared with placebo (3951).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to be beneficial for osteoarthritis treatment or prevention.\nTaking vitamin E 500 IU daily for 6 months does not seem to decrease symptoms of pain or stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis when compared with placebo (5264). Additional clinical research show that taking vitamin E 500 IU daily for up to 2 years does not slow cartilage loss when compared with placebo (13066). Population research has shown that taking vitamin E supplements does not reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis or slow the progression of existing osteoarthritis (5881).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pancreatic cancer risk.\nTaking vitamin E supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants such as beta-carotene and vitamin C does not reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer (12185, 85147). Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5 to 8 years also does not seem to reduce the incidence of or mortality from carcinoma of the pancreas in male smokers (3961).\nless\nParkinson disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce Parkinson disease symptoms or progression, although the risk of developing the disease may decrease with increased dietary vitamin E intake.\nObservational research has found that dietary vitamin E intake might be associated with a decreased occurrence of Parkinson disease (4712). A meta-analysis of 12 studies evaluating the risk of developing Parkinson disease has found that the highest daily intake of vitamin E is associated with a 20% lower risk than those with the lowest intake (107858). However, clinical research in patients with stage I or II Parkinson disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for up to 24 months doesn't seem to have any benefit when compared with baseline or control (4709, 4710, 4711, 85318).\nless\nPharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of developing cancer of the pharynx.\nA sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial (The HOPE Trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing oral or pharyngeal cancer when compared with placebo (13036).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pre-eclampsia risk.\nThe majority of clinical research shows that taking a combination of vitamins E and C, at the same doses, does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in low-, moderate-, or high-risk patients, when compared with placebo or no treatment. Also, the risk of gestational hypertension might increase in some cases, although results are inconsistent (83312, 83356, 83383, 83472, 83474, 97075, 97059). Other researchers using vitamin E in combination with vitamin C and allopurinol beginning at 24-32 weeks gestation found the combination similar to placebo (4718). However, some clinical research suggests that taking a combination of vitamin E 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily reduces the risk of proteinuric hypertension in high-risk patients when started in weeks 16-22 of pregnancy (3236).\nless\nPreterm labor. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk for premature labor.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for preterm labor when compared with placebo (97075).\nless\nProstate cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.\nA meta-analysis of over 30 large clinical trials and observational studies shows that neither dietary nor supplemental vitamin E reduces the risk of prostate cancer when compared with a control (112159). However, individual study results are mixed.\n\nPopulation research on the use of dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake for prostate cancer risk reduction is conflicting (12872, 14124, 12873, 15607). Although one large-scale study in smokers found that taking 55.6 IU daily of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) reduced the risk of prostate cancer and mortality (3959, 11303), most large-scale randomized, controlled trials show that vitamin E is not beneficial. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical study (The HOPE trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily for about 7 years is not linked with a decreased risk of developing prostate cancer when compared with placebo (13036). Another large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared with placebo (16708, 90097). Similarly, another large clinical study (The SU.VI.MAX study) shows that a combination of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 44.7 IU, vitamin C 120 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and zinc 20 mg daily for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer overall when compared with placebo (14135). A fourth large-scale clinical trial (The SELECT trial) in men over the age of 50 years shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, alone or in combination with selenium 200 mcg daily, for an average of about 5.5 years does not reduce prostate cancer risk when compared with placebo (16707). Also, an extension of this initial study found that taking vitamin E alone was associated with a 17% increased of developing prostate cancer (17688).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce respiratory infections in most patients. However, there's some evidence that it might reduce incidence of the common cold in patients living in long-term care facilities.\nTaking oral vitamin E 298 IU daily, alone or in supplemental multivitamin form, does not appear to decrease the incidence, duration, or severity of upper or lower respiratory infections in elderly persons when compared with placebo (10788, 12094). However, some research shows that taking vitamin E reduces the incidence of the common cold in elderly long-term care patients when compared with placebo (12094). More evidence is needed to determine how effective vitamin E might be for reducing the incidence of the common cold.\nless\nRetinitis pigmentosa. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce retinitis pigmentosa and related visual decline.\nTaking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) orally does not appear to slow visual decline is people with retinitis pigmentosa and has been associated with more rapid loss of visual acuity, although the validity of the study with these findings has been questioned (83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88).\nless\nScarring. Topical vitamin E does not seem to improve scar appearance.\nSome clinical research shows that applying ointment containing vitamin E topically does not reduce surgical wound scarring when compared with a placebo ointment (4721, 4722).\nless\nStillbirth. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk of a stillborn baby.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients during pregnancy does not reduce the risk for stillbirth when compared with placebo (97075).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nBreast cancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce breast cancer risk.\nSome evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin E might be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (10132). However, increasing vitamin E intake from the diet or supplements does not seem to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer (4658, 4659, 85147, 112334). Also, a large-scale randomized trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease shows that patients who take 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily do not have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer (13036). In other large-scale studies, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing breast cancer (13131, 34580).\nless\nCancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk of cancer in most patients.\nSome research suggests that a combination of vitamin E 44.7 IU daily with vitamin C, beta-carotene, selenium, and zinc does not lower the overall risk of cancer, although it might reduce the risk of cancer when only males are evaluated (14109). However, clinical research from a large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the overall risk of cancer in males when compared with placebo (16708, 90097). Also, clinical research published in a meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce the overall risk of cancer (85147). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E and overall cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that the evidence is limited and inconclusive (102334). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of cancer in general and therefore recommends against its use (108641, 112166).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Most evidence shows that oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk for CVD events or complications.\nMost clinical research in various populations shows that taking vitamin E supplements orally is not effective for preventing heart disease or adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalizations for unstable angina, morbidity, or cardiovascular death (12492, 12493, 13036, 14108, 66140, 83050, 85084, 85224). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of CVD in general and therefore recommends against its use (108641, 112166). With few exceptions (3357, 3936), large-scale controlled clinical trials show that vitamin E supplements offer no benefit for primary prevention in healthy or high-risk patients (3907, 3935, 3937, 13036, 13131), or for secondary prevention of heart disease and cardiovascular events such as MI, stroke, and death (3896, 3899, 13036). While one analysis of clinical research found that in mostly healthy patients 70 years or younger without CVD, vitamin E supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality, the authors performed more than 20 statistical tests and did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Therefore, it possible that the positive effect was due to chance. This analysis was also limited because it excluded adults older than 70 years of age and adults that are more likely to suffer an exacerbation from a chronic condition. Furthermore, the analysis showed that vitamin E supplementation does not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality or the risk of CVD compared with placebo or no intervention (97078).\n\nThere's additional conflicting evidence. One large-scale trial shows that healthy females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of major cardiovascular events but might have a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular death when compared with placebo (13131). This finding is contradictory to previous findings. One notable limitation of this trial is a lack of systematic assessment of the use of statins or other cardiovascular therapies by the participants throughout the 10-year period. Meta-analyses of clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype show that taking vitamin E, up to 600 IU daily for up to 8 years, reduces the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and death due to CVD (85179, 85221). Because these meta-analyses included only specific patients, the generalizability of the results is questionable.\n\nThere is debate about whether some forms of vitamin E might work differently than others. Some people suggest that RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) is more effective than all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). This has not been verified by studies. A meta-analysis of vitamin E studies indicates that there is no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes based on the form of vitamin E used (13132). The FDA has refused to allow labeling claims for vitamin E supplements for prevention of CVD (3939). A Science Advisory from the American Heart Association also states that the evidence doesn't justify use of antioxidants such as vitamin E for reducing the risk of CVD (12142). Advise patients not to rely on vitamin E supplements for preventing heart disease.\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce death in preterm infants.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin E throughout pregnancy does not affect morbidity or mortality in preterm infants when compared with placebo (85074, 97075).\nless\nFibrocystic breast disease. Oral vitamin E does not improve fibrocystic breast disease in most patients.\nClinical research shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 150 IU, 300 IU, or 600 IU daily for 2-3 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of fibrocystic breast disease when compared with placebo (4660, 4661, 4662).\nless\nLung cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce lung cancer risk.\nTaking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-8 years is not associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer for male smokers (3949). A sub-group analysis of a large scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with placebo (13036). In another large-scale study, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer (13131). Meta-analyses of clinical research suggest taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol for up to approximately 10 years does not prevent lung cancer or reduce the incidence of lung cancer mortality when compared with placebo (34632, 85147). However, a large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E, but not total intake or supplementation with vitamin E, is associated with a modest reduction in development of lung cancer (112096).\nless\nOverall mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of mortality from all causes.\nAlthough some population research suggests that increased dietary vitamin E intake is associated with reduced overall mortality (98260), most meta-analyses of clinical research in adults show that taking vitamin E supplements for at least 1 year does not affect all-cause mortality (34622, 85164, 85200). Furthermore, when only high quality clinical trials were analyzed, mortality was increased by 3% in adults taking vitamin E when compared with control (34622).\nless\nPrematurity. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of premature birth and complications.\nClinical research shows that vitamin E does not improve blood parameters or prevent the development of anemia in premature infants (4648, 10362). One clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 25 IU daily for six weeks does not improve hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte counts, or platelet counts when compared with placebo (4648). Another clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1250 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 50 IU daily for eight weeks does not increase the response to erythropoietin and iron when compared with placebo (10362).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in Asian females aged 30-65 years shows that applying a specific liquid product, (Antioxidant and Collagen Booster Serum, Max Biocare Pty Ltd.) containing vitamin E 1%, vitamin C 20%, and red raspberry leaf cell culture extract 0.0005%, to the face nightly for 8 weeks, in addition to regular facial skin products, improves skin color, elasticity, radiance, smoothness, and appearance of wrinkles when compared with regular facial skin products alone (102355).\nless\nAluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in the management of aluminum phosphide poisoning.\nA small clinical study in patients in Iran admitted to the intensive care unit with aluminum phosphide poisoning shows that administering vitamin E 400 mg intramuscularly twice daily reduces malondialdehyde levels, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality when compared with supportive care alone (114119).\nless\nAnemia of chronic disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E might improve response to anemia treatment in patients on chronic hemodialysis.\nTwo small studies in adults and children on chronic hemodialysis have shown improved response to erythropoietin with vitamin E supplementation (4640, 4647). In one study, children given vitamin E 22.4 IU/kg in combination with erythropoietin had significantly increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after 2 weeks of combination treatment, compared with eight and five weeks in patients receiving erythropoietin alone (4640). In a study of adults, concurrent supplementation with vitamin E 745 IU daily allowed dose reductions of erythropoietin from an average of 93 U/kg/week to 74 U/kg/week with the same resultant hemoglobin levels (4647).\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg three times daily and L-carnitine 3000 mg by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by 300 mg by mouth four times daily thereafter for 3 weeks reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 63% and improved laboratory markers of cardiotoxicity when compared with chemotherapy alone (112338). It is unclear if these findings are due to vitamin E, L-carnitine, or the combination.\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with anxiety.\nA meta-analysis of 5 mostly small clinical studies in patients without anxiety shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU daily for up to 10 weeks does not improve anxiety symptom scores when compared with placebo (112158). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with anxiety disorders.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for asthma treatment or prevention.\nThere is inconsistent evidence about the role of vitamin E in asthma. Some population research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of asthma; however taking vitamin E supplements are not associated with decreased risk (6058, 15006). Low vitamin E intake also appears to be associated with an increased risk of asthma (315, 401, 422).\n\nA small clinical study in children with asthma suggests that adding vitamin E 74.5 IU by mouth daily to fluticasone treatment for 8 weeks may decrease cough, wheezing, and dyspnea when compared with baseline (90077). This study was limited because it did not compare the vitamin E intervention to the control group.\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of atopic disease in infants.\nPopulation research has found that increased maternal vitamin E intake isn't associated with decreased odds of developing eczema, food allergy, wheeze, allergic sensitization, or any allergic disease in infants (90098).\nless\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces bladder cancer risk.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that the highest intake of vitamin E is associated with a reduced risk for bladder cancer when compared to the lowest intake in patients followed for more than 10 years. This benefit was not seen in those followed for less than 10 years. This effect appears to be dose-dependent, although it is not clear how much vitamin E intake is required to reduce bladder cancer risk. Additionally, it is not clear whether this benefit differs for dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin E (101435). Population research also suggests that regular use of vitamin E supplements for more than 10 years is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer mortality; however, use for less than 10 years is not associated with reduced mortality (9839). In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and bladder cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer (102332).\n\nA moderate-sized clinical study in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU orally daily for an average of 1.5 years increases the risk of recurrence, but not progression or death, when compared with placebo (114116).\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is beneficial for healing of burn wounds.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate and deep burn wounds (25% to 67%) shows that applying a specific alpha-tocopherol product (Filme Olio) daily seems to reduce infection and improve healing when compared with usual treatment (104407).\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain, but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function, when compared with control (111702). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChemotherapy-related infection. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with infection due to chemotherapy.\nObservational research suggests that greater dietary intake of vitamin E may lower the incidence of infection in children undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoblastic leukemia (11997).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition.\nCisplatin-associated ototoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing ototoxicity due to cisplatin.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving cisplatin for solid tumors shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Rigentex, Bracco) as alpha-tocopherol 400 IU daily for 3 months attenuates hearing loss when compared with placebo (97082).\nless\nColistin-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing nephrotoxicity due to colistin.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving colistin therapy shows that taking vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU orally daily for the duration of colistin therapy does not reduce the incidence or duration of acute kidney injury when compared with colistin alone (107867).\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin E is beneficial in patients with nephropathy due to contrast dye.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving elective computer-assisted tomography with nonionic radiocontrast agents shows that receiving vitamin E 3218 IU emulsion in 0.45% saline intravenously infused at the rate of 1 mL/kg/hr over 24 hours does not decrease the risk of contrast agent-induced nephropathy when compared with normal saline alone (90081).\n\nHowever, oral vitamin E may modestly reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy. A clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol 522 IU or gamma-tocopherol 447 IU orally daily, starting 5 days prior to the procedure and continuing 2 days post-procedure, results in a 9% to 10% lower incidence of contrast induced acute kidney injury when compared with standard treatment with normal saline (90096). Another clinical study shows that taking a single dose of vitamin E 1490 IU orally before elective coronary angiography reduces the risk of contrast induced kidney injury by 7% when compared with placebo (97074).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for recovery after CABG.\nWhen taking vitamin E orally with vitamin C and allopurinol two days prior to CABG and one day postoperatively, patients had fewer perioperative infarctions and lower creatine kinase-MB release (4699); however, this benefit was not found when using vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C without allopurinol (4697, 4698). Other clinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery in Iran shows that taking vitamin E 1200 IU and zinc 120 mg orally the day before surgery and vitamin E 200 IU and zinc 30 mg orally daily for 3 weeks after the surgery reduces hospital length of stay by approximately 2 days when compared with placebo (114118). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, zinc, or the combination. Additionally, the generalizability of this result is limited by the single-center study design and inclusion of only lower risk patients.\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). An analysis of several small clinical studies suggests that oral or intravenous vitamin E is not beneficial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in patients admitted to the ICU shows that administration of oral or intravenous vitamin E 400-3000 IU daily for up to 4 weeks does not decrease the length of hospital or ICU stay or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with control (112335). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies, which included differences in vitamin E dosing, duration of therapy, and reasons for ICU admission.\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for dementia prevention; the available research is conflicting.\nA longitudinal cohort study in Japanese adults aged 40 years or older at baseline who were followed for a median of about 20 years, shows that total daily dietary intake of vitamin E is inversely associated with the risk of developing dementia, with a hazard ratio of about 0.8 for the highest compared with lowest quartiles of intake (107857). In a longitudinal cohort study of males aged 71-93 years, consuming supplemental vitamin E and vitamin C decreased the risk of developing vascular and mixed or other dementias; however, there was no protective effect for Alzheimer dementia (4636). Evidence from clinical research that evolved into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily does not decrease the incidence of dementia in males 60 years or older (93570). However, the results from this study are limited by selection bias due to the high education levels and relatively young age of the participants, limitations with case ascertainment, and problems with follow-up (93570, 93571). Also, these studies did not distinguish between different forms of vitamin E (4636, 93570).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with depression.\nA meta-analysis of 7 mostly small clinical studies in patients without major depressive disorder shows that taking vitamin E 400-2000 IU daily for up to 6 months modestly improves depression symptom scores when compared with placebo (112158). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with depression.\nless\nDevelopmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for DCD; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, shows that taking vitamin E orally, in combination with evening primrose oil, thyme oil, and fish oils, for 4 months seems to improve movement when compared with control (5708). The effects of vitamin E alone on DCD are unclear.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of diabetes.\nPopulation research has found that higher vitamin E dietary intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004). However, individual clinical studies in patients with existing diabetes show mixed results (13496, 13497, 90095, 90099, 98259). A meta-analysis of 36 small clinical studies in patients with diabetes suggests that vitamin E may slightly improve some measures of glycemic control. In patients with type 2 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.2% and improve insulin resistance, but not fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo. In patients with type 1 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce HbA1c by around 0.8%, but does not improve fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo (112161). The validity of this analysis is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including differences in vitamin E dose, treatment duration, concomitant medications, patient populations, and study designs.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for diabetic foot ulcers; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with a grade 3 diabetic foot ulcer shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU and magnesium oxide 250 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces ulcer length, width, and depth when compared with placebo (101436). A small clinical study in adults with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers being treated with a platelet-rich plasma fibrin glue dressing shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 12.5 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks increases the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. In those receiving vitamins, 46% of wounds closed completely, compared with 17% of those receiving placebo (107870). It is not clear if the effects seen in these studies are due to vitamin E, the other nutrients, or the combinations.\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E 600-1200 mg daily, alone or with other antioxidants, modestly reduces urinary albumin excretion when compared with placebo or no treatment, but seems to have no effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (97069). A small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce serum creatinine, with a corresponding increase in GFR, when compared with placebo. According to a sub-group analysis, these improvements remain statistically significant in patients with low tocopherol levels (less than 42 mcmol/L) at baseline, but not in those with higher levels at baseline (103010). Another small clinical study shows that taking this same supplement regimen for 12 months reduces serum creatinine levels and improves GFR at 8 months, but not 12 months, when compared with placebo. In a subgroup analysis of patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, these benefits persisted at 12 months when compared with placebo (107390).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms.\nA small clinical trial in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and neuropathy shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Evion) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly decreases neuropathic pain scores when compared to baseline (90091). Another very small clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E 1341 IU daily for 6 months improves nerve conduction in diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo (4724).\nless\nDown syndrome. Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow cognitive decline in patients with this condition.\nA clinical study in patients over 50 years old with Down syndrome shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU twice daily for 3 years does not slow cognitive decline when compared with placebo (97076).\nless\nEndometriosis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with endometriosis and pelvic pain shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks improves dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain scores when compared with placebo (106622).\nless\nExtravasation. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy shows that applying vitamin E topically, in combination with DMSO, seems to prevent skin ulceration after chemotherapy extravasation (4668).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing gastric cancer or reducing associated mortality.\nPopulation studies have found that increasing dietary vitamin E intake by 22.4 IU daily is associated with a 21% decreased risk of gastric cancer (3360, 90083). However, clinical trials have not found that vitamin E supplements reduce gastric cancer risk (3960, 4676, 4677, 12185).\n\nStudies evaluating vitamin E in combination with other supplements have been inconsistent. In one large-scale clinical trial a specific combination of vitamin E 100 IU with selenium 37.5 mcg and vitamin C 250 mg twice daily for about 7 years did not reduce risk of gastric cancer in patients from Shandong Province in China where there is a very high prevalence of gastric cancer (14447, 90085). In another large-scale clinical study of 29,584 people in China, the combination of oral vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium over 5 years did reduce total mortality, total cancer mortality, and stomach cancer mortality (4679). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E plus beta-carotene with or without vitamin C does not reduce gastric cancer incidence (12185).\nless\nGlomerulosclerosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces proteinuria due to glomerulosclerosis in children.\nA very small clinical study in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis who are refractory to standard medical management shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU daily orally might reduce proteinuria when compared with baseline (4675). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nGranuloma annulare. Although there is interest in using topical vitamin E for granuloma annulare, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition.\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with Helicobacter pylori dyspepsia without ulcers shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 30 days in addition to standard triple therapy increases eradication rates by 37% when compared with triple therapy alone (90094). It is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination.\nless\nHuntington disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves Huntington disease symptoms.\nA small clinical study shows that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) might improve symptoms in patients with early Huntington disease, but this benefit is not seen in patients with more advanced disease when compared with placebo (4686).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with hypertension shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU orally daily for 2-27 weeks substantially lowers systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with control (113668). The validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity. Other preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension who are receiving conventional treatment shows that taking vitamin E 300 mg daily orally for 3-4 years does not lower blood pressure when compared with control (5210).\nless\nIgA nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for IgA nephropathy in children.\nA small clinical study in children with IgA nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E (400 IU for those weighing less than 30 kg; 800 IU for those weighing more than 30 kg) improves urinary protein to creatinine ratio, but not glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, or hematuria, when compared with placebo (85063).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves pregnancy rates in females with infertility of unknown cause.\nA small clinical study in females experiencing implantation failure shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks improves endometrial thickness when compared with placebo (99852). However, an observational study suggests that there is no association between dietary vitamin E intake and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes including good oocyte quality, embryo transfer success rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and successful term pregnancy rates in subfertile couples who are candidates for IVF (112097).\n\nVitamin E has also been studied in combination with selenium. In a small clinical study in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), taking vitamin E 400 IU with selenium 200 mcg orally daily for 90 days increases anti-Mullerian hormone index, antral follicle count, and mean ovarian volume after 12 months of follow-up when compared with placebo (107866). It is unclear if these improvements correlate to higher pregnancy or live birth rates.\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in postmenopausal patients with chronic insomnia shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 1 month improves sleep quality ratings and reduces the need for sedative medications when compared with placebo (112163).\nless\nIntermittent claudication. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves intermittent claudication symptoms.\nA large clinical study in male smokers with intermittent claudication shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 50 mg orally daily for about 3.7 years does not appear to have any effect when used alone or in combination with beta-carotene for treating symptoms or disease progression when compared with placebo (4732). However, according to poor-quality clinical research included in a meta-analysis, taking vitamin E 447-2384 IU daily for up to 18 months appears to reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication (85023).\nless\nLice. Topical synthetic vitamin E might be beneficial for head lice eradication.\nA small clinical study in children and adults with head lice shows that topical application of a specific tocopheryl acetate 20% spray (LiceKO, Panin SRL) once, and then again 7 days later, is more effective for eliminating lice when compared with permethrin 1% cream rinse (90067).\nless\nMale infertility. An analysis of several small, low-quality clinical studies suggests that oral vitamin E might improve pregnancy rates and measures of sperm health in males with infertility.\nSeveral small clinical studies in males with infertility show conflicting results (3583, 4695, 107865). However, a meta-analysis of 7 small, low-quality clinical trials shows that taking vitamin E 300-600 IU for 12-48 weeks increases pregnancy rates by 86% and modestly improves sperm count, concentration, motility, and vitality, but does not seem to increase semen volume, when compared with a control (109461).\n\nVitamin E has also been used in combination with other nutrients with unclear results. Small studies show that taking vitamin E 800 mg daily with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks doesn't seem to improve sperm functionality (4696), while vitamin E 400 IU plus selenium 200 mcg daily for at least 100 days improves sperm functionality, but not fertilization rates, when compared with baseline (3585). In another small clinical study in infertile males undergoing varicocelectomy, taking vitamin E 400 IU, selenium 200 mcg, and folic acid 5 mg daily for 6 months improved sperm count and motility when compared with control (102968). Another small clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 100 mg and coenzyme Q10 10 mg three times daily for 3 months modestly increases levels of testosterone and improves progressive sperm motility and morphology when compared to baseline. However, taking an L-carnitine nutrient complex 15 grams twice daily was more effective for increasing testosterone and improving sperm parameters (109390). However, it is unclear if any of these combination therapies increases live birth rates.\nless\nMelanoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing melanoma risk.\nA sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing melanoma when compared with placebo (13036).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU twice daily for 8 weeks reduces hot flashes, but does not affect other menopausal symptoms or anxiety, when compared with placebo. The improvement in hot flashes was no longer present 4 weeks after the intervention (102969). However, a meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in postmenopausal patients, including the study above, shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 8 weeks does not reduce hot flash frequency when compared with placebo (111460).\nless\nMethotrexate toxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of liver toxicity due to methotrexate.\nAn observational study in patients taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis has found that taking vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for 3 months is associated with reductions in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels when compared with no supplementation. This suggests a reduction in liver injury in the treatment group (104414).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may not improve muscular dystrophy symptoms or progression.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with myotonic or Duchenne muscular dystrophy show that taking vitamin E along with penicillamine or selenium doesn't appear to slow disease progression or improve symptoms when compared with placebo (4703, 4704).\nless\nNocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces leg cramps in veterans or in patients on hemodialysis.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU at bedtime for 2 months seems to reduce the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps when compared with placebo (4701). However, another small clinical study in male veterans shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce cramp frequency or severity or reduce sleep disturbances when compared with placebo (4702).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in adults or children with NAFLD.\nOne meta-analysis of studies assessing both NAFLD patients and patients in whom NAFLD progressed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) shows that taking vitamin E 100-800 IU daily for 1-24 months improves liver enzyme levels, hepatic steatosis, and lobular inflammation when compared with control. However, taking vitamin E does not appear to improve hepatic fibrosis in these patients (97077). Methodological limitations such as publication bias and unclear calculations limit the reliability of these results. Another meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials in adults with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin E 400-800 IU daily for up to 24 weeks improves liver enzyme levels when compared with placebo (112336).\n\nVitamin E has also been evaluated in children with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of studies in this population shows that taking vitamin E 15-900 IU daily for up to 24 months reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but does not affect liver enzyme levels, measures of insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), ballooning degeneration of the liver, or liver fibrosis when compared with placebo (107861).\n\nUntil additional data showing its benefit becomes available, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) state that vitamin E is not recommended in patients with NAFLD without liver biopsy (98130).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving weight loss.\nA meta-analysis of 24 small clinical studies shows that taking oral vitamin E, 67-900 mg daily does not affect weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference in adults with obesity. In fact, in people with a normal BMI, vitamin E seems to increase body weight (107859).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical vitamin E is beneficial in patients with oral mucositis from chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nVitamin E has been evaluated in both chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis. A small clinical study in children with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis shows that a specific vitamin E product (Evion Paediatric Drops, Merck Limited) 200 IU applied topically in three divided doses daily for 1 week improves healing, pain, and the ability to eat when compared with placebo (94585). However, another small clinical study in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that taking vitamin E 1000 mg once daily with pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily does not reduce the incidence or severity of oral mucositis and dysphagia when compared with control (102972).\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps slow the progression of osteopenia.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia who are taking calcium and vitamin D supplements shows that taking vitamin E (mixed tocopherols) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks prevents the increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide, a marker of bone resorption, seen with placebo over that same time period (107868).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps to reduce complications of osteoporosis such as fractures.\nObservational research has found that vitamin E supplementation is associated with a 22% lower risk of hip fracture and a 14% lower risk of all fractures in elderly females with osteoporosis (90086). Additional observational research has found that higher dietary vitamin E intake is also associated with a 34% reduced risk of fractures in adults at risk for osteoporosis (104415).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo (111708).\nless\nPeyronie disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces Peyronie disease symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with Peyronie disease shows that taking vitamin E 894 IU daily in addition to conservative treatment for 6 months does not improve pain, but may reduce plaque, when compared with using conservative treatment alone. Conservative treatment included verapamil 10 mg biweekly injection and iontophoresis, blueberries 160 mg orally daily, propolis 600 mg orally daily, and topical diclofenac 4% twice daily (90090). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, the other interventions, or the combination.\nless\nPhotoreactive keratectomy. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated for recovery after photoreactive keratectomy in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing laser surgery for myopia shows that taking vitamin A (retinol palmitate) 50,000-75,000 units with vitamin E (alpha-tocopheryl nicotinate) 343 IU daily seems to accelerate re-epithelialization, reduce haze formation, and improve visual acuity when compared with placebo (348).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves physical performance in the elderly.\nPopulation research has found that increasing intake of dietary vitamin E is associated with increased physical performance and muscle strength in elderly people (14006).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Analyses of small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with PCOS. It is unclear if vitamin E can improve glycemic control, body weight, hormone levels, or symptoms of PCOS.\nMeta-analyses of several small clinical studies in patients with PCOS show that taking vitamin E, alone or in combination with coenzyme Q10, fish oil, magnesium, or vitamin D, reduces total cholesterol by 9-18 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 7-16 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 13-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, vitamin E does not appear to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, reduce body weight, or improve hirsutism. The effects of vitamin E on glycemic indices and levels of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin are unclear; individual meta-analyses show mixed results (112167, 112168, 112169). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the included studies, which varied in vitamin E dosing, treatment duration, and concomitant supplements used.\nless\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM). Oral vitamin E does not seem to prevent PROM, although it's unclear if it might prevent premature delivery due to PROM.\nVitamin E has been evaluated for the prevention and management of PROM. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not affect the risk of developing PROM when compared with placebo (97075). However, a clinical study in patients with PROM shows that taking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate) 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily, starting within 1 hour of membrane rupture and continuing for an unspecified amount of time, seems to hold back premature delivery by about 5 days when compared with placebo. However, maternal or neonatal outcomes did not seem to be affected (90078). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination.\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation dermatitis.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer shows that applying a cream containing nanoparticles of vitamin E 2%, three times daily and after each radiation session until 2 weeks after radiation therapy is complete, does not reduce the severity of radiation dermatitis or improve quality of life when compared with a placebo cream. However, in patients that did not receive a boosted radiation dose, this vitamin E cream seems to slightly delay the onset of dermatitis when compared with placebo (112333).\nless\nRadiation fibrosis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E reduces radiation fibrosis symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU orally with pentoxifylline 800 mg daily seems to reverse radiation fibrosis (4672, 4673). Regression of radiation fibrosis becomes significant after three months of treatment and continues to improve thereafter. After 12 months of treatment, mean surface area of fibrosis can decrease by 66% (4672). It is unclear if the benefit is due to vitamin E, pentoxifylline, or the combination. One very small study suggests that vitamin E alone does not seem to be effective when compared with placebo (10363).\nless\nRadiation-induced sialadenitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation-induced sialadenitis.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for thyroid cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 mg daily for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before radiotherapy, improves several measures of parotid and submandibular salivary gland function when compared to baseline, suggesting that vitamin E might prevent radiation-induced sialadenitis and its associated complications (112332). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces renal cell carcinoma risk.\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and renal cell carcinoma risk. This qualified health claim was based on one weak and limited study. The FDA has determined that it is highly uncertain that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma (102332).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in hemodialysis patients shows that taking vitamin E 596 IU, vitamin C 200 mg, or a combination of both daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces severity of restless legs syndrome when compared with placebo (90093).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. It is unclear whether oral or parenteral vitamin E reduces the risk for retinopathy in prematurity (ROP).\nA clinical study in very low birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome suggests that giving vitamin E 12.5 IU twice daily from 72 hours after birth through 28 days of age might reduce the incidence of stage 1 ROP when compared with placebo. However, the difference reached significance in the per-protocol analysis, but not in the intention-to-treat analysis (107864). Also, a meta-analysis that did not include this more recent study shows that administering oral, intravenous, or intramuscular vitamin E daily does not reduce the risk for ROP. Additionally, high levels of vitamin E and large intravenous doses of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants (85062).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with RA.\nA small clinical study in adults with RA shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg twice daily in conjunction with standard therapy for 12 weeks is superior to standard therapy alone for reducing pain, but not inflammation (4723). However, other studies show mixed results. A meta-analysis of 7 small clinical studies in patients with RA shows that taking vitamin E up to 1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks does not reduce pain, tenderness, swelling, or morning stiffness when compared with control (112330).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTaking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 135.8 IU and a specific ascorbic acid supplement (CellaVie) 250 mg with or without ethyl eicosapentaenoate 500 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve negative or positive symptoms of schizophrenia when compared with placebo (89234).\nless\nSickle cell disease. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for sickle cell disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition.\nStretch marks (striae distensae). Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that using a moisturizer containing vitamin E, rosehip oil, hydroxyprolisilane C, and gotu kola triterpenes at least twice daily on affected areas does not decrease incidence of new stretch marks, but does decrease the severity of new stretch marks by about 30%, when compared with control cream in pregnant patients (90076). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing stroke risk.\nA trial-sequential meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials with 148,000 patients shows that vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of total stroke when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis, vitamin E was associated with an 8% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a trend to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke when compared with placebo. Based on subgroup analyses, there was no difference on risk based on vitamin E dosage, use of synthetic versus natural vitamin E, and whether prevention was primary or secondary (104408). This analysis was limited due to high heterogeneity, small study size, and insufficient power to detect differences between treatments. Older meta-analyses also found mixed results of using vitamin E 74.5-1192 IU daily alone or in combination for up to 10 years. However, there was a similar sub-group analysis finding that vitamin E might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke, but it might also increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (14621, 85201). Some clinical research shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in male smokers with hypertension and diabetes (3359).\nless\nSunburn. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral vitamin E alone does not seem to prevent sunburn.\nTwo small, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies suggest that taking high dose oral RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) up to 2 grams daily in combination with vitamin C 3 grams protects against skin inflammation after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to be beneficial when compared with control (4715, 4716). This combination was also tried topically. In one study, topically applied vitamin E in combination with topical vitamin C and melatonin provided modest photoprotective effect when used prior to UV exposure, but had no effect when used during or after UV exposure (4713, 4714).\nless\nUveitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking vitamin E 149 IU twice daily with vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks improves visual acuity in patients with acute anterior uveitis, but does not seem to decrease inflammation measured by laser flare, when compared with placebo (4730). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination.\nless\nVaginal atrophy. It is unclear if a vitamin E suppository is beneficial in patients with vaginal atrophy.\nA small clinical study in females with breast cancer and tamoxifen-induced vaginal atrophy shows that intravaginal administration of a vitamin E 1 mg suppository nightly before bed for 8 weeks improves self-reported symptoms of vaginal atrophy, decreases vaginal pH, and improves vaginal estrogenization, as measured by the Vaginal Maturation Index, when compared with placebo (99773).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate vitamin E for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) is 15 mg daily. For RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E), the RDA is 22 IU; for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E), it is 33 IU (4844). The RDA during pregnancy is 15 mg; the RDA during lactation is 19 mg (4844). See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTaking vitamin E with food seems to improve absorption. Some research suggests that taking vitamin E with high-fat food may further improve absorption because the fat allows for solubilization and incorporation into micelles (4844, 85095, 97072). However, other research suggests that low-fat food can also improve vitamin E absorption (6133, 6405).\n\nDosing for vitamin E can be confusing. Quantities may be listed in various sources and clinical studies as mg or International Units (IU). Current guidelines have expressed RDAs and tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamin E in mg. However, some products are still labeled in IUs. Thus, it is important to understand how to convert between IUs and mg of vitamin E. The appropriate method for doing this depends on the formulation of vitamin E being considered and whether an RDA or a UL is being calculated.\n\nFor an RDA calculation, RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) can be converted from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol by multiplying by a factor of 0.67. For example, 30 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol equals 20 mg. To convert all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol, multiply by a factor of 0.45. For example, 30 IU all-rac-alpha-tocopherol equals 13.5 mg.\n\nWhen calculating a UL, the conversion factor for RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) remains the same. However, the conversion factor for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is different because the UL assumes that all isomers of vitamin E can contribute to toxicity. To convert all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg, multiply by a factor of 0.91. For example, 2000 IUs all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is equivalent to 1820 mg. The same factors are used for either acetate or succinate salts because the content has been adjusted for the molecular weights of the salts (4844).\nTopical:\nVitamin E has been used in various formulations, including a spray, cream, intravaginal suppository, and more. See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The RDAs for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) in children are: 0-6 months of age, 4 mg; 7-12 months of age, 5 mg; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg; 4-8 years of age, 7 mg; 9-13 years of age, 11 mg; 14 years and older, 15 mg (4844).\n\nSee the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nAll-rac-alpha-tocopherol is the synthetic version of vitamin E. RRR-alpha-tocopherol is vitamin E extracted from natural sources (12212). Vitamin E exists in eight different forms (isomers): alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol (13504).",

However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy.

These effects appear to be dose-dependent, and are probably only likely to be clinically significant with doses of at least 800 units daily (11582, 11585). Mixed tocopherols, such as those found in food, might have a greater antiplatelet effect than alpha-tocopherol (10364). RRR alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 1000 IU daily antagonizes vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (11999).

However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells (14012, 14013). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy involving antitumor antibiotics.

This vitamin E formulation forms micelles which seems to increase absorption of cyclosporine by 40% to 72% in some patients (624, 625, 10368). However, this interaction is unlikely to occur with the usual forms of vitamin E.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, vitamin E might induce metabolism of CYP3A4, possibly reducing the levels CYP3A4 substrates.\nVitamin E appears to bind with the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), which results in increased expression of CYP3A4 (13499, 13500). Although the clinical significance of this is not known, use caution when considering concomitant use of vitamin E and other drugs affected by these enzymes.\nless\nNIACIN\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nVitamin E might decrease the beneficial effects of niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.\nA combination of niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) effectively raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in people with coronary disease and low HDL levels. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium) along with niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) attenuates this rise in HDL, specifically the HDL-2 and apolipoprotein A1 fractions, by more than 50% (7388, 11537). Vitamin E alone combined with a statin does not seem to decrease HDL levels (11286, 11287). It is not known whether the adverse effect on HDL is due to one of the other antioxidants or to the combination. It also is not known whether it will occur in other patient populations.\nless\nSELUMETINIB (Koselugo)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTaking selumetinib with vitamin E can result in a total daily dose of vitamin E that exceeds safe limits and therefore might increase the risk of bleeding.\nSelumetinib contains 48-54 IU vitamin E per capsule (102971). The increased risk of bleeding with vitamin E appears to be dose-dependent (11582, 11585, 34577). Be cautious when using selumetinib in combination with supplemental vitamin E, especially in patients at higher risk of bleed, such as those with chronic conditions and those taking antiplatelet drugs (102971).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nUsing vitamin E with warfarin might increase the risk of bleeding.\nDue to interference with production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, use of more than 400 IU of vitamin E daily with warfarin might increase prothrombin time (PT), INR, and the risk of bleeding, (91, 92, 93). At a dose of 1000 IU per day, vitamin E can antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors even in people not taking warfarin (11999). Limited clinical evidence suggests that doses up to 1200 IU daily may be used safely by patients taking warfarin, but this may not be applicable in all patient populations (90).\nless",

Concomitant use with herbs that also affect platelet aggregation could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding in some people. See other products with antiplatelet activity here. See products with anticoagulant activity here.\nless\nBETA-CAROTENE\nVitamin E might reduce levels of beta-carotene. Some evidence suggests that vitamin E might reduce absorption of beta-carotene, due to competition for solubilization in micelles. Taking vitamin E 800 units daily seems to reduce plasma beta-carotene levels by 20%. It is thought that higher doses might further reduce beta-carotene levels (10561).\nIRON\nLarge doses of vitamin E might reduce the therapeutic effects of iron supplements in infants with anemia.\nLimited data suggest excessive doses of vitamin E (>10 IU/kg/day) can delay the red blood cell response to iron supplements in severely anemic infants (11547). However, taking small doses of vitamin E with iron do not seem to have the same effect. One clinical study shows that giving iron 6 mg/kg plus vitamin E 27 IU daily for 8 weeks normalizes serum ferritin level in infants with iron deficiency (ferritin levels <15 mcg/L). This increase in serum ferritin was not different when compared to giving the same dose of iron without vitamin E (97081). It is not known whether this interaction occurs in adults.\nless\nOMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDS\nTheoretically, large quantities of omega-6 fatty acids might reduce vitamin E content in the body.\nIncreased intake of omega-6 fatty acids may increase vitamin E requirements, particularly at higher doses (4844).\nless\nVITAMIN A\nTheoretically, vitamin E might alter the effects of vitamin A.\nLaboratory and animal research suggests that vitamin E might alter the effects of vitamin A, including preventing oxidation in the gut and increasing absorption, enhancing utilization, promoting liver storage, protecting against cell damage caused by high vitamin A levels, and reducing some of the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A (10545, 10557, 10558, 10560).\nless\nVITAMIN K\nLarge doses of vitamin E might interfere with the effects of vitamin K.\nTaking vitamin E in doses of at least 800 IU daily can decrease the effects of vitamin K. This might increase the risk of bleeding in people taking warfarin or other anticoagulants, especially in those patients with low vitamin K levels (93, 7135). Vitamin E antagonizes vitamin K by decreasing its absorption and by binding to vitamin K dependent enzymes (7135, 11512).\nless",

Advise patients with head and neck cancer to avoid taking vitamin E supplements in doses of 400 IU daily or more.\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nTheoretically, high doses of antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin C might interfere with exercise strategies to increases bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. One clinical study shows that taking vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E 522 IU daily attenuates increases in bone mineral density (BMD) induced by strength training in healthy older males. This is in contrast to a previous preliminary clinical study in elderly females that shows a preservation of BMD after resistance exercise and supplementation with vitamin C 1000 mg and vitamin E 1332 IU daily (97080).

These drugs include cisplatin, etoposide, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, and thiotepa (98, 10366, 11588, 11589). The clinical significance isn't clear, but there is some concern that low vitamin E levels might increase the risk of chemotherapy-associated toxicity (10366, 11589). In some cases, vitamin E levels return to normal between chemotherapy cycles (11588). The role of supplements hasn't been established.\nless\nBILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nBile acid sequestrants might reduce vitamin E levels.\nCholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid) reduce absorption of dietary fat, so there is concern that they might reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins, including vitamin E. Some studies suggest that the bile acid sequestrants lower vitamin E levels by 7% to 20%. But other studies have found no effect on vitamin E levels (4455, 4456, 4457, 4460, 4461, 10566, 10567). When decreases did occur, they were often in proportion to the lowering of LDL (on which vitamin E is transported), and did not fall below the lower limit of normal (5 micrograms/mL) with up to 2 years of treatment (4455, 4457, 4460, 4461).

It's suggested more vitamin E is used to quench free radicals generated during metabolism of the anticonvulsant in the liver (11575, 11577, 11578). The clinical significance isn't clear. Vitamin E supplements don't seem to be harmful in children with epilepsy. They've been associated with either no effect on seizure control (11578), or improved seizure control (4671).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with vitamin E.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbsorption of all forms of vitamin E takes place mostly in the small intestine by passive diffusion. The variability in absorption rates can be dependent on individual patient qualities such as pancreatic function and level of inflammation (85171). For example, patients with metabolic syndrome seem to have reduced absorption and lower bioavailability of vitamin E (98261).\n\nThere is no difference in absorption between free alpha-tocopherol, its acetate, or its succinate esters (13501, 13504). Alpha-tocopherol exists as eight stereoisomers. The RRR-alpha-tocopherol isomer, formerly called d-alpha-tocopherol, has the greatest affinity for alpha-TTP and the most biologic activity (4844). RRR-alpha-tocopherol is sometimes called natural vitamin E and occurs naturally in foods (4844). The racemic mixture of all eight alpha-tocopherol isomers, or all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, was formerly known as dl-alpha-tocopherol (4844). All-rac-alpha-tocopherol has lower affinity for alpha-TTP and thus has less biologic activity than RRR-alpha-tocopherol (4627, 4844). Based on weight, 15 mg of RRR-alpha tocopherol is approximately equivalent in potency to 30 mg of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (99, 200, 218, 4844). Although higher bioavailability for the natural form is well-known, the relative potency of natural and synthetic vitamin E is controversial. Some researchers cite the potency of the natural to synthetic form as 1.36, rather than 2 (100, 202, 247, 248). Synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) is also best absorbed when taken with food, but it is unclear if the food needs to be fatty (6133, 6405, 85095). In conditions with severe fat malabsorption such as short bowel syndrome, lipid soluble forms of vitamin E, such as those in food, may not be absorbed. A water soluble form of vitamin E such as tocopheryl succinate polyethylene glycol 10,000 (TPGS) may improve vitamin E status in these people (10367).\n\nSupplementation with alpha-tocopherol suppresses plasma and tissue levels of gamma tocopherol. Supplementation with gamma-tocopherol causes increases in both gamma- and alpha-tocopherols (12494). Some research suggests gamma-tocopherol might be transformed to alpha-tocopherol by intestinal microflora (13501).\nDistribution\nSupplemental vitamin E usually refers to alpha-tocopherol. For biological activity, vitamin E, as alpha-tocopherol, depends on hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) for distribution. Alpha-TTP is present in the brain, uterus, and placenta, and possibly the spleen, lung and kidney (13498). Plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol are about 4-10 times higher than those of gamma-tocopherol. However, other experts contend that gamma-tocopherol levels are high in some tissues such as skin, muscle, vein, and adipose tissues (85217, 85291).\nMetabolism\nThe metabolism and excretion of vitamin E is not fully understood. It appears to be a substrate of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, possibly CYP3A4 (13498, 13500). Vitamin E also appears to activate a nuclear receptor called the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which results in increased expression of CYP3A4 (13499, 13500). However, the clinical significance of this requires further research.\nExcretion\nVitamin E is eliminated is primarily unchanged via feces (85171). Water-soluble metabolites of vitamin E are excreted in urine (12494, 85131).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin E is naturally occurring in many foods including vegetable oils, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables (96). Vitamin E refers to eight different forms including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Most vitamin E in foods is gamma-tocopherol while most supplements contain alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest bioavailability and is used to set dietary requirements (107858). Unlike most nutrients, vitamin E does not appear to have a specific role in a required metabolic process.\n\nThe major function of vitamin E is probably that of a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the formation of free radicals. Vitamin E's therapeutic benefits have primarily been attributed to its antioxidant effects (4844, 12494, 13501, 30898). Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Although biological activity of other forms is significantly less and current guidelines do not include forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol for meeting dietary requirements (4844), the other forms, such as gamma-tocopherol and the tocotrienols, have been associated with some pharmacological activity. For example, gamma-tocopherol appears to decrease the programmed death of human coronary artery endothelial cells.\n\nThere is some concern that high doses of vitamin E might have a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant effect (12495, 13036, 16823). Alpha-tocopherol-mediated peroxidation (TMP) occurs in vitro, but whether this occurs in vivo isn't clear (13504). High doses of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) alone might disrupt the normal antioxidant balance and decrease the effect of other vitamin E isomers such as gamma-tocopherol and other antioxidants (12496, 13036). In early pregnancy, this imbalance may adversely affect uteroplacental tissues, affect development of placenta-related disease, and embryogenesis (16823).\nAnalgesic effects\nVitamin E is thought to reduce pain by decreasing the production of prostaglandins via prevention of phospholipid peroxidation and arachidonic acid release (99367).\nAnti-dementia effects\nVitamin E has been studied for its ability to slow the progression of Alzheimer disease, possibly due to an interaction with free radicals and a disruption of cellular damage (11472). Preliminary data suggest vitamin E might improve cognitive function by decreasing beta-amyloid damage (4637, 4638, 4639).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nVitamin E might be beneficial in diabetes. Population research shows that higher vitamin E intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004). Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin E improves glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes (4726). However, vitamin E supplementation does not seem to affect insulin resistance measured by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and only improves glycemic parameters in patients with diabetes that also have low vitamin E levels at baseline (13496, 90095, 90099, 98259).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with various conditions shows that taking vitamin E seems to modestly lower inflammatory markers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, when compared with control (104406). A meta-analysis of 11 trials in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E, typically in a dose of 400 IU daily for 2-20 weeks, decreases markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and markers of systemic inflammation including CRP, when compared with placebo or no treatment. There was no effect on IL-6 (107863).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIncreased vitamin E intake has been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers such as renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and many others (3360, 90083, 98262). Theoretically, vitamin E reduces oxidative damage, which is associated with the development of cancers (5882). Several mechanisms have been theorized for reducing carcinogenesis, including the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, the inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines, and enhancement of immune function (9839, 98262). Preliminary evidence also shows that vitamin E and other antioxidants can decrease oxidative damage associated with tumor-directed radio-immunotherapy (5882). Vitamin E is used for photo-aged skin and to prevent oxidative skin damage related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., sunburn) due to its antioxidant effects. However, some researchers think that this benefit requires concomitant use with other antioxidants such as vitamin C to prevent degradation of vitamin E (6062, 6064). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also adversely affect vitamin E status (98).\n\nVitamin E inhibits protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in several cell types, including smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes (4844). Preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might have an antiproliferative effect on benign hyperplastic prostate cells (11235). Population studies suggest an association between low serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and higher risk of prostate cancer (12874). In vitro research suggests that gamma-tocopherol, the primary vitamin E form in food, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells, but alpha-tocopherol has no effect (4089, 13503). This inhibitory effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer cells might be due to its antiandrogen activity (12875, 12876). RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, known as vitamin E succinate (VES), is currently being researched for its chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive potential. VES has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, primarily by triggering apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma (3361). There is some evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with alpha tocopheryl succinate (8046).\nApolipoprotein effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that oral alpha-tocopherol in doses of 100-1200 IU daily does not have a significant effect on apolipoproteins A1 or B100 (107860).\nCardiovascular effects\nOxidative damage has been attributed to many conditions for which vitamin E is used, including lipid peroxidation in heart disease (6204). Some preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might inhibit the local inflammatory process and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is associated with atherosclerosis (97, 249), but when this theory was tested in healthy adults without heart disease, RRR-alpha-tocopherol, even at 2000 IU/day, did not produce markers that indicate a reduction in lipid oxidation (13159).\n\nIt also does not appear to reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that is associated with cardiovascular disease, when used in combination with vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid (14010, 85129). This appears to be another case where promising laboratory data turns out to be clinically irrelevant. Vitamin E also doesn't appear to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in older adults with hypercholesterolemia (11286).\n\nThe tocotrienols from rice and barley bran might lower total cholesterol and LDL, possibly by decreasing activity of HMG CoA reductase, but in a different way than \"statin\" drugs (3237, 3238, 3239, 3240, 3241). Tocotrienols might also be capable of decreasing carotid artery plaque size in some people, possibly by decreasing platelet aggregation (3239). Vitamin E might also lower the protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This potential pro-oxidant effect could result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes (13036).\n\nGamma-tocopherol appears to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and has caused hemorrhage in experimental animals (4098). Beta- and delta-tocopherol have also been shown to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in laboratory animals (4098).\n\nLarge amounts of vitamin E interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factor production, producing hypoprothrombinemic effects, especially in people with vitamin K deficiency or those who are taking oral anticoagulants (3073, 3074). Mixed tocopherols seem to have a greater effect on platelet aggregation than alpha-tocopherol alone, which might explain the discrepancy between the effects of dietary vitamin E intake and supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in cardiovascular disease. Mixed tocopherols seem to increase nitric oxide (NO) release and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content in platelets, which may contribute to the effect on platelet aggregation (10364).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nIn tardive dyskinesia, it is thought that some patients may have increased dopamine turnover resulting in increased production of free radicals and structural damage. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E may reduce the number of free radicals that increase dopamine turnover. Additionally, people with tardive dyskinesia may have decreased levels of vitamin E and vitamin C (3598).\n\nAlso, in the treatment of epilepsy, vitamin E is primarily used because some patients taking anti-epileptic drugs have decreased blood levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E might also act as a membrane stabilizer and enzyme repressor in these patients (3356, 6066).\nDeficiency\nVitamin E deficiency is rare and most typically seen in genetic abnormalities that prevent maintenance of normal blood concentrations of vitamin E or conditions that prevent absorption. Vitamin E deficiency does not cause specific disease in adults, although creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, and decreased erythrocyte survival are associated with low serum vitamin E concentrations. In adults, total body stores of vitamin E, found in adipose tissue, have been estimated to be 3-8 grams and are sufficient to meet the body's requirements for 4 or more years of a deficient diet. In premature infants, vitamin E deficiency can cause irritability, edema, thrombosis, and hemolytic anemia (15).\n\nSome evidence links asthma to increased oxidative stress and vitamin E deficiency. Epidemiological and case-control studies have associated asthma with lower vitamin E intake, lower vitamin E serum levels, lower vitamin E levels in lung lining fluid, and maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy (315, 401, 409, 422, 6058, 15006). But clinical studies using vitamin E for asthma have not been performed.\n\nVitamin E might also work by non-antioxidant mechanisms. Preliminary research suggests that it affects cellular signaling and modifies gene expression in cerebellar cells involved in the regulation of coordinated movement. Cerebellar ataxia is a symptom of vitamin E deficiency (13505).\nImmunomodulating effects\nVitamin E may play a role in allergic reactions. Lower vitamin E serum levels have also been associated with higher IgE levels and positive allergen skin tests (5275).\n\nFor immune function in the elderly, vitamin E supplementation might replenish an inapparent deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin E and other micronutrients are common in apparently well-nourished people over age 90 and might affect the number and function of natural killer cells in old age (4688). Most research suggests that vitamin E supplementation in healthy elderly people improves response to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing (DTH), an indicator of immune function, and antibody response to hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccines (4676, 4689, 4690, 4691). But whether vitamin E supplementation results in better health in elderly people is unknown.\nNeuroprotective effects\nSmall clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) for up to 1 year seems to modestly increase nerve conduction velocity when compared with placebo (104427, 107388).\nRenal effects\nSome researchers think the antioxidant activity of vitamin E may slow progression of renal disease. Oxidative metabolites may accumulate in renal dysfunction. Vitamin E could theoretically slow the rate of decline in chronic inflammatory kidney diseases such as IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulosclerosis; and poisoning by nephrotoxic drugs and other compounds (10369). Furthermore, there has been some speculation that vitamin E intake might reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Some population research shows that vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of kidney cancer or renal cell carcinoma (98262)."

    "Vitamin K": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin K refers to a group of chemically similar, fat-soluble compounds called naphthoquinones (91449). The name vitamin K comes from the German word Koagulationsvitamin (57). Vitamin K1, also known as phytonadione or phylloquinone, is found in plants such as green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils (64). Vitamin K2, the menaquinones (MK), are made by bacteria in the human gut or consumed in foods such as cheese (64). Vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 (MK-4) are available in North America, while other forms (e.g. vitamin K3 and vitamin K4) are not (15, 17).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when vitamin K1 (phytonadione) or vitamin K2 (menaquinone) is used orally and appropriately. A tolerable upper intake level for vitamin K in adults has not been set, because no adverse effects have been noted at a wide range of studied doses. For example, Vitamin K1 up to 10 mg daily and vitamin K2 up to 45 mg daily have been safely used in clinical trials lasting up to 2 years. (54, 55, 58, 6799, 7135, 14364). Notably, some of these studied doses are exponentially higher than various recommendations for daily adequate intake. See Dosing & Administration and Effectiveness sections for additional information...when vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is used parenterally and appropriately. Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) in oral and injectable form is an FDA-approved drug (7135).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 0.1% is used topically in a cream or ointment for up to 12 weeks (91455, 103919).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is used orally or parenterally and appropriately. Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) in oral and injectable form is FDA approved for use in children. A tolerable upper intake level for vitamin K in children has not been set (7135).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the daily adequate intake level (AI). A tolerable upper intake level for vitamin K in pregnancy and lactation has not been set (7135).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, vitamin K is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, nausea, and stomach upset.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nIntravenously: There have been rare cases of anaphylaxis and hyperbilirubinemia (in infants).\nDermatologic\nOrally, intake of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) along with calcium and vitamin D3 can cause an increased incidence of skin and skin appendage lesions compared to taking calcium and vitamin D3 alone. However, the risk of this adverse event is low, with 0.5 incidences per 100 patient-years occurring for patients treated with vitamin K, calcium, and vitamin D3 and 0.1 incidences per 100 patient-years occurring for patients treated with calcium and vitamin D3 alone (85467).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, vitamin K can cause mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects (91450, 91451). The most common effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (91450, 91451).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, vitamin K3 (menadione) has been linked to hepatotoxicity. Vitamin K3 is no longer used therapeutically in North America because it has been linked to hepatic toxicity and jaundice in animal research (7135).\nless\nOther\nIntravenously, vitamin K can cause reactions that resemble hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis (85389). These reactions are rare. It is unclear whether the adverse effect is caused by the drug or a component of the solution. There have been very rare cases of hyperbilirubinemia, particularly in premature neonates, following large doses of vitamin K (15). One clinical study in premature infants shows that intramuscular administration of vitamin K 1.0 mg increases bilirubin levels and the duration of phototherapy when compared with vitamin K 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is unclear, as no differences in bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction were reported (112100).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nHemorrhagic disease. Oral or intramuscular vitamin K1 is effective for preventing hemorrhagic disease in newborns.\nVitamin K1 (phytonadione) administered orally or intramuscularly can prevent classic hemorrhagic disease of newborns (15, 85367, 85484). A single intramuscular administration of vitamin K1 1 mg is considered to be the most effective method, while oral administration of three doses of vitamin K1 1-2 mg over 8 weeks is considered to be an acceptable alternative (85506).\n\nThe effects of vitamin K on late hemorrhagic disease of newborns is less clear (85367, 85484). In the Netherlands, an oral dose of 25 mcg daily for 3 months was used until 2011, when it was increased to 150 mcg daily. A reduction of late intracranial vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the general pediatric population, from 1.6 per 100,000 to 1.3 per 100,000, was associated with this dose increase (102351).\n\nThe effect of various doses of intramuscular birth vitamin K prophylaxis has also been investigated in premature infants. A small clinical study in premature infants born at or before 32 weeks gestation or who weigh 1500 grams or less shows that administering intramuscular vitamin K1 at doses of 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0 mg (Kenadione, Samarth Life Sciences PVT Ltd) within 1 hour of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit improves subclinical vitamin K deficiency. While infants in all 3 dosing groups had sufficient vitamin K levels at 5 days old, by day 28 those who were initially administered vitamin K 0.3 mg had higher rates of subclinical vitamin K deficiency and lower rates of vitamin K sufficiency. Rates of intraventricular or periventricular hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and mortality did not differ across dosing groups (112100).\nless\nHypoprothrombinemia. Oral or parenteral vitamin K1 is effective for treating and preventing hypoprothrombinemia.\nVitamin K1 (phytonadione) 2.5-25 mg, used orally or parenterally, can prevent and treat hypoprothrombinemia caused by vitamin K deficiency or induced by salicylates, sulfonamides, quinine, quinidine, or broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (15).\nless\nVitamin K-dependent clotting factors deficiency (VKCFD). Oral and intravenous vitamin K1 is the primary treatment for VKCFD.\nOral supplementation with vitamin K 10 mg two to three times weekly seems to prevent major hemorrhages and reduce mucocutaneous bleeding in individuals with VKCFD. Also, intravenous vitamin K may improve the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) values in these patients. While vitamin K supplementation is the primary treatment method for VKCFD, the response to treatment varies significantly (85481).\nless\nWarfarin anticoagulation. Oral and intravenous vitamin K1 reverse warfarin-related excessive anticoagulation. Evidence for the use of oral vitamin K1 in patients with an unstable INR is conflicting.\nTaking vitamin K1 (phytonadione) orally or parenterally, but not subcutaneously, can counteract excessive warfarin anticoagulation and restore therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels. Usually a single dose of 1-5 mg is used (85406, 85425, 85429).\n\nVitamin K might also be effective for stabilizing warfarin anticoagulation in patients with low intake of vitamin K. Patients with a low dietary vitamin K intake are significantly more likely to have an unstable INR than those who ingest higher amounts of vitamin K (16803). It is thought that vitamin K-depleted patients become more sensitive when vitamin K is ingested, even in small quantities, resulting in erratic or unstable INR (16804). One small clinical study and one small retrospective chart review show that taking oral vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 100-150 mcg daily improves INR stability in patients taking warfarin who previously had an unstable INR (16805, 16806). However, a larger clinical study found no significant differences in INR stability in patients taking vitamin K 100 mcg daily when compared with placebo (16807). Also, some research suggests that, although taking vitamin K 1250 mcg daily may reduce INR in patients with excessive warfarin anticoagulation more significantly than placebo, there may not be a significant difference in the risk of bleeding complications (23380). It is important to keep in mind that, if a patient is stabilized on warfarin therapy plus vitamin K supplementation, discontinuing vitamin K can significantly increase the INR within 2-3 weeks after discontinuation (17714).\n\nThe most recent guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians do not recommend routine use of vitamin K supplementation for patients on warfarin therapy with unstable INR (94926). However, the previous guidelines recommended vitamin K 100-200 mcg daily for these patients. Therefore, some providers still use vitamin K for this purpose (16808).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoporosis. Oral vitamin K might reduce the risk of fractures and bone loss in patients with osteoporosis. However, it may not be beneficial in patients at risk for developing osteoporosis.\nAlthough observational and clinical research on dietary and supplemental vitamin K for osteoporosis has been conflicting (14364, 85392, 85445, 102354, 112106), overall, vitamin K supplementation seems to slightly reduce fracture risk (102354). A meta-analysis combining data from 36 heterogeneous studies in osteoporotic or postmenopausal patients shows that taking different regimens of either vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 is associated with a small reduction in clinical fractures (from 3.1% to 2.2%), but not with changes in vertebral fractures or BMD when compared with control (102354). This analysis is limited by the high variability in study designs and a lack of subgroup analyses stratifying different patient populations and forms of vitamin K.\n\nIn contrast, a meta-analysis of 16 studies in postmenopausal adults shows that taking various forms of vitamin K2 improves lumbar spine BMD based on 10 studies, especially when combined with other therapies such as vitamin D, calcium, or alendronate. However, vitamin K2 does not improve hip, femoral neck, or forearm BMD when compared with placebo. Furthermore, meta-analyses of 25 studies show that vitamin K2 does not reduce the incidence of fractures when compared with control (91451, 112106). However, a sensitivity analysis that excluded the largest negative study of over 4000 postmenopausal Japanese females with mild osteoporosis (85456), shows that vitamin K2 45 mg daily reduces the risk of fractures by 53% and improves lumbar and vertebral BMD in patients with osteoporosis when compared with control (91451). This effect was not seen in patients without osteoporosis (91451). Vitamin K2 also does not seem to benefit patients with osteopenia. A recent clinical trial in postmenopausal patients with osteopenia shows that taking a larger dose of vitamin K2 (375 mcg, MK-7) with calcium 800 mg and vitamin D 1500 IU daily for 3 years does not seem to affect BMD, bone turnover, or bone microarchitecture when compared with placebo (105035).\n\nVitamin K1 (phytonadione) has also been evaluated, with mixed findings. One clinical study in postmenopausal patients with osteopenia shows that taking vitamin K1 5 mg daily with calcium 1500 and vitamin D 800 IU for up to 4 years reduces clinical fractures, but does not reduce clinical fragility fractures or improve BMD, when compared with placebo and vitamin D with calcium (85453). In healthy, non-osteoporotic patients ages 60-80 years, one clinical study shows that taking vitamin K1 500 mcg daily with calcium 600 mg and vitamin D 400 IU for 3 years does not affect BMD, despite increased plasma vitamin K levels and reduced undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentrations, when compared with taking calcium and vitamin D alone (16404). The same null effect on BMD and a reduced undercarboxylated osteocalcin was shown in a small clinical study in patients with Crohn disease without osteoporosis, taking vitamin K1 1-2 mg in combination with vitamin D3 400 IU and calcium 500 mg daily for 12 months (91454).\n\nOne small clinical trial compared vitamin K1 with vitamin K2 in postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis. This research shows that taking either vitamin K1 1 mg or vitamin K2 45 mg orally daily for 18 months in conjunction with a bisphosphonate does not improve femoral, spine, or hip BMD when compared with taking placebo and a bisphosphonate. All participants also took vitamin D supplements throughout the study (114778).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nIntraventricular hemorrhage. Oral vitamin K does not reduce the risk of periventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.\nA meta-analysis of results from clinical research shows that administering vitamin K to pregnant patients at risk for very preterm birth does not reduce the overall risk of periventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants, perinatal mortality, or the associated neurological injury by the age of 7 years when compared to control. A subgroup analysis shows that vitamin K might reduce the risk of severe periventricular hemorrhage by 42% in preterm infants. However, when trials with inadequate blinding were excluded, this result was not statistically significant (85469).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin K2 improves athletic performance.\nA small clinical study shows that taking vitamin K2 (menaquinone) 320 mcg orally daily for 4 weeks followed by 160 mg daily for 4 weeks, increases maximal cardiac output by 12% when compared with placebo in trained athletes performing standardized cycle ergometer exercise tests (95937).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. Oral vitamin K2 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking the menaquinone-7 (MK-7) form of vitamin K2 50 mcg daily plus vitamin D3 (calcitriol) 5 mcg daily for 12 months modestly improves bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine when compared to baseline in children with beta-thalassemia aged 3-18 years (91456). It is not clear if this improvement can be attributed to vitamin K, vitamin D3, or the combination.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K2 reduces the risk of breast cancer.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) or vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is not associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer (85474).\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces the risk of cancer or cancer-related mortality.\nOne large population study involving healthy German patients has found that consuming more than 42-46 mcg of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) daily is associated with a 27% reduced risk of cancer mortality, but not cancer incidence, when compared with consuming less than 23-26 mcg daily. Dietary intake of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) was not associated with the risk of cancer or cancer mortality (85474). Another population study involving Mediterranean patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease has found that consuming about 630 mcg of vitamin K1 daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of cancer mortality when compared with consuming about 171 mcg of vitamin K1 daily. However, higher dietary intake of vitamin K2, 87 mcg daily, was not associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality when compared to those with lower dietary intake (79 mcg daily) (91452). Reasons for these discrepancies may relate to the definitions for high and low intake, the use of different databases to calculate vitamin K intake, and the different populations studied.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if dietary or supplemental vitamin K reduces the risk of CVD events; the available research is conflicting.\nMost population research, including a meta-analysis of 21 observational cohort studies, has found that dietary intake of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) or vitamin K2 (menaquinone) is not associated with reduced risk for most cardiovascular events, such as CVD mortality, nonfatal MI, or stroke, although there might be a slightly reduced risk for CHD (85414, 85482, 91452, 102353, 103922).\n\nHowever, some population studies have found benefit. Observational research in a Danish cohort aged 50-65 years with no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline shows that those in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin K1 intake have a 21% lower risk of CVD-related hospitalization and complications, such as ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, or peripheral artery disease, over 17-22 years when compared with the lowest quintile of intake. This inverse association tapers off at intakes above 100 mcg daily. For vitamin K2 intake, the highest quintile has a 14% lower risk of hospitalization when compared with the lowest quintile, although the association is U-shaped, indicating an increased risk at high doses. The researchers theorize that this may be due to the fact that vitamin K2-rich foods include cheese, eggs, and butter (109910, 109920).\n\nThere is also interest in using vitamin K to slow aortic valve calcification (AVC) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), which are CVD risk factors. In healthy patients ages 60-80 years with pre-existing CAC, taking a multivitamin with vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 500 mcg orally daily for 3 years reduces CAC progression by 6% when compared with the multivitamin alone (85461). However, research in patients with AVC has found no benefit. One small clinical study in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking the menaquinone-7 form of vitamin K2, 200 mcg orally daily for 1 year, does not affect the rate of AVC progression when compared with placebo (102352). Also, clinical research in males with significant AVC shows that taking the menaquinone-7 form of vitamin K2 720 mcg and vitamin D 25 mcg orally daily for 2 years does not reduce the rate of AVC progression or the rate of cardiovascular events, heart valve surgery, or all-cause mortality when compared with placebo (109916).\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if dietary vitamin K reduces the risk of cataracts in older adults.\nA secondary analysis of results from clinical research has found that higher dietary vitamin K1 (phytonadione) intake over a mean 5.6 years' follow-up is associated with a lower risk of cataracts and a lower incidence of cataract surgery in older adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The hazard ratio for developing cataracts was 0.71 and the hazard ratio for cataract surgery was 0.75 for people in the highest tertile of dietary vitamin K1 intake when compared with the lowest tertile (95936).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if dietary vitamin K alters the rate of decline in adults with cognitive impairment.\nClinical research in adults aged 55-75 years with overweight or obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive impairment shows that the largest increases in dietary vitamin K intake over a 2-year period are linked to a slower rate of cognitive decline when compared with the lowest increases in intake. This is demonstrated by higher scores on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency tests, and a greater number of patients maintaining an MMSE score of at least 24 (109919).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K2 reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) or vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (85474).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin K improves coagulopathy in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nSuboptimal vitamin K status is common in patients with cystic fibrosis, especially those with pancreatic insufficiency, due to problems with fat digestion (85359, 85479). Preliminary clinical research in patients with cystic fibrosis shows that taking vitamin K 1-5 mg orally for one month might decrease osteocalcin levels when compared with baseline, which suggests a lower risk of bone fractures (103920). Also, a small clinical trial in adults and children with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency shows that taking a supplement containing fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K for an average of 8.6 months reduces the number of patients with abnormal levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), a defective form of prothrombin (85374).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces depression.\nPopulation research has found that a dietary intake of vitamin K greater than 232 mcg daily is associated with reduced odds of depressive symptoms when compared with intakes of less than 83 mcg daily in older adults who are not taking vitamin D supplements. For every 100 mcg increase in vitamin K intake per day, the study found an 18% reduction in odds of depressive symptoms. However, there was no association identified in individuals taking vitamin D (100181). The effect of vitamin K for the prevention or treatment of clinical depression has not been investigated.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin K improves glycemic control in adults with diabetes.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetes on oral antidiabetes medications shows that taking vitamin K2 (MK-7) 180 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 1.6%, compared with a slight increase in the placebo group (105034). This study is limited by the high dropout rate in the placebo group. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking vitamin K1 or K2 for 1 to 36 months modestly improves fasting blood glucose levels and markers of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (11475). The validity of this analysis is limited by high heterogeneity, including different forms and dosing regimens of vitamin K. One small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking vitamin K4 1 mg orally daily for 6 months does not improve HbA1c or fasting blood glucose levels when compared with placebo. However, subjects taking vitamin K4 had a greater improvement in certain markers of insulin resistance and were more likely to be able to reduce the dose of their antidiabetes medications (114776).\n\nThere is also interest in vitamin K for the prevention of diabetes. A meta-analysis of population research suggests that low dietary vitamin K intake is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with higher intake (114775). The validity of this study is limited by the identification of publication bias.\nless\nEGFR inhibitor-induced acneiform rash. It is unclear if topical vitamin K is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of acneiform rash caused by EGFR inhibitors.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults receiving treatment with cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor, shows that applying vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 0.1% cream (Vigorskin, Merck Serono SpA) twice daily to the face and trunk for 12 weeks may modestly reduce the percentage of patients who develop a moderate to severe acneiform rash (91455). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. In patients with an existing rash after receiving the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and panitumumab, a small clinical study shows that applying vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 1% ointment twice daily for 8 weeks to half of the affected area does not reduce the number of acneiform eruptions when compared with using placebo ointment on the other half of the affected area (103919). Patients in this study were allowed to use concomitant antibiotics and moisturizing agents, which may have confounded the results.\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral vitamin K2 reduces the incidence or severity of muscle cramps in adults with kidney failure.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients on maintenance hemodialysis for at least 3 months with treatment-resistant muscle cramps shows that taking the menaquinone form of vitamin K2 360 mcg orally daily for 8 weeks reduces the frequency, severity, and duration of muscle cramps when compared with placebo (109917).\nless\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if vitamin K is beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with a stable kidney transplant for at least 1 year shows that taking vitamin K (menadiol diphosphate) 5 mg three times weekly for 1 year does not reduce aortic stiffness or coronary artery calcification, which are markers of cardiovascular disease, when compared with placebo (109913). The effects of long-term supplementation are unclear. Additionally, another very small study in adult kidney transplant recipients with vitamin K deficiency shows that taking supplemental vitamin K2 360 mcg daily for 12 weeks improves vitamin K status and prevents the progression of arterial stiffness but does not reduce serum calcification propensity when compared with placebo (112132).\nless\nLiver cancer. Small clinical studies suggests that vitamin K2 reduces mortality and the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.\nMeta-analyses of 9-11 small clinical trials in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma show that adding vitamin K2 45 mg daily for up to 3 years seems to reduce cancer recurrence by 9.5% and reduce the risk of mortality by 7% when compared with control. Meta-analyses of 3-4 small clinical trials in patients with non-resectable carcinoma show that taking vitamin K2 45 mg for up to 2 years seems to reduce cancer recurrence by 3% and reduce mortality by 16% when compared with control (105032). Most of the included studies were conducted in Japan, so it is unclear if these results are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nLiver disease. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces the risk of liver disease.\nA small observational study in patients with chronic liver failure due to cholestatic liver disease has found that receiving intramuscular vitamin K1 10 mg daily for an average of 16 days is associated with a lower risk of death when compared with control (103926).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces the risk of lung cancer.\nPopulation research has found that consuming greater than 42-46 mcg of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) daily is associated with a 62% lower risk of lung cancer occurrence and a 59% lower risk of lung cancer mortality when compared to those who consume less than 23-26 mcg of vitamin K2 daily. Dietary intake of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer or lung cancer mortality (85474).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if topical vitamin K reduces cutaneous adverse effects of MS treatment.\nIn patients with relapsing-remitting MS, burning and pain can accompany subcutaneous interferon treatment. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of vitamin K cream (dose not specified) for 8 weeks reduces burning by approximately 8% and pain by 9% when compared with no prophylactic treatment. Redness of the skin is also reduced with vitamin K (91453).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces overall mortality.\nObservational research in healthy older adults has found that serum vitamin K levels 0.5 nmol/L or less, which corresponds to consuming about 50% of the recommended vitamin K adequate intake, is associated with a 19% higher risk of overall mortality when compared with higher serum levels of vitamin K (103922). In a Danish cohort of adults with a median age of 56 years at baseline, the comparative risk for all-cause mortality between the highest and lowest quintiles of K1 intake over a period of 17-23 years was 0.76. The risk for cardiovascular mortality was 0.72, and the risk of cancer-related mortality in smokers or former smokers, specifically, was 0.8. However, the correlation tapered off above a daily intake of 100 mcg (109911).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nObservational research in over 100,000 Americans aged 55-74 years at baseline has found no association between dietary vitamin K2 intake and pancreatic cancer incidence over an average follow-up of 9 years.

It is unclear if vitamin K improves PCOS symptoms.\nSmall clinical study in patients with PCOS show that taking vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) 90 mcg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose, acne, hirsutism, or weight, although it improves depression and seems to reduce fasting insulin, when compared with placebo (105036, 109918).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of vitamin K reduces the risk of prostate cancer.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 (menaquinone), but not vitamin K1 (phytonadione), is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, particularly advanced prostate cancer (85443, 85474).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral vitamin K improves RA symptoms.\nOne small clinical study in patients with RA shows that adding the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) 100 mcg daily to treatment with conventional antirheumatic agents for 3 months improves disease activity and inflammatory markers when compared with antirheumatic agents alone. When compared to the control group, vitamin K2 reduced disease activity scores by 41% (91449). However, another small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate RA shows that taking vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 10 mg daily for 8 weeks with conventional antirheumatic agents does not improve disease activity or inflammatory markers when compared with placebo (100182). These contrasting outcomes may be related to the type of vitamin K used, the duration of treatment, and the severity of the illness.\nless\nRosacea.

Vitamin K has also been taken as part of fortified multivitamins (85461) or in combination with fat-soluble vitamins (85374). Clinical trials have used various types of oral vitamin K, including vitamin K1 (phytonadione) (91454, 100182) and the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) (91449).\n\nTopical vitamin K1 has been applied in creams such as Vigorskin. This contains 0.1% vitamin K1, in a base of urea, wheat germ oil, hydrolyzed wheat protein, ceramides, and phytosphingosine (91455).\n\nVitamin K is also used intravenously and intramuscularly (85367, 85425).",

Concomitant use of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K might increase the risk of clotting in people taking anticoagulants.\nless\nTIRATRICOL\nTheoretically, tiratricol might antagonize the prothrombinemic effects of vitamin K.\nTiratricol is related to thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine. Levothyroxine antagonizes the prothrombinemic effects of vitamin K by increasing catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (15). It is not known if tiratricol has these effects.\nless\nVITAMIN A\nTheoretically, large doses of vitamin A might antagonize the effects of vitamin K.\nAnimal research has shown that high doses of vitamin A (retinoids) antagonize the effects of vitamin K. However, this interaction has not been reported in humans (7135, 10560, 25510).\nless\nVITAMIN E\nLarge doses of vitamin E might block the effects of vitamin K.\nTaking vitamin E in doses of at least 800 IU daily can antagonize the effects of vitamin K, increasing the risk of bleeding in people who are taking warfarin or have low vitamin K intakes (93, 7135, 25511). Vitamin E appears to reduce the absorption of vitamin K and to bind to vitamin K-dependent enzymes, preventing their activity (7135, 11512).\nless",

            "Nutrient Depletions": "ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nProlonged therapy with antibiotic drugs might decrease levels of vitamin K.\nVitamin K produced by intestinal bacteria is absorbed from the ileum (4437, 4439, 9502). This contribution to overall vitamin K status is unclear, and likely varies (4439, 7135). Destruction of vitamin K-producing bacteria by antibiotics can sometimes lead to vitamin K deficiency, prolonging clotting times and increasing bleeding risk (4439, 9502, 11513, 11514, 11515, 11516). It's suggested that antibiotics such as cefamandole that are secreted into the bile in large amounts have a greater effect on vitamin K-producing bacteria (11514). Also, some cephalosporins have a methylthiotetrazole side chain that may interfere with vitamin K activity, directly inhibiting clotting factor production in the liver (4439, 11516). These cephalosporins include cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefmetazole, and cefotetan. This interaction is most likely to occur with prolonged antibiotic therapy (10 days or more) in people with poor dietary vitamin K intake (11514, 11515, 11516). Vitamin K supplements aren't necessary for otherwise healthy people taking short courses of antibiotics. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin K, see our chart.\nless\nANTICONVULSANTS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nCertain anticonvulsants might decrease levels of vitamin K in adults; some anticonvulsants may also decrease vitamin K levels in the fetus when taken during pregnancy.\nWhen taken during pregnancy, anticonvulsants that induce hepatic enzymes (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) can reduce vitamin K levels in the fetus and increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage soon after birth (11521, 11522, 11523, 11524, 11525). It's thought that liver enzyme induction by these drugs increases vitamin K metabolism (11521, 11522, 11523, 11525). This has a significant effect on vitamin K levels in infants, who haven't built up stores of the vitamin (11525). When anticonvulsants are needed during pregnancy, vitamin K 10-20 mg daily should be taken orally for the last month of pregnancy, and the baby should receive vitamin K immediately after delivery (11522, 11525). There is also limited evidence that chronic carbamazepine or phenytoin therapy can cause subclinical reductions in vitamin K activity in adults. There are rare reports of prolonged clotting times and bleeding in people with additional risk factors for vitamin K deficiency, such as poor nutritional intake (10582, 11533, 11534). These anticonvulsants don't significantly affect vitamin K and clotting parameters in most children and adults. For information on foods that are rich in vitamin K, see our chart.\nless\nBILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nBile acid sequestrants might decrease the absorption and levels of vitamin K.\nBy reducing absorption of dietary fats, bile acid sequestrants may also reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K. Some studies have found no changes in vitamin K levels or prothrombin times after up to 2 years of bile acid sequestrant use (4455, 4460, 10566). However, there are a few case reports of hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding, usually in people with other risk factors (4458, 11519).\nless\nMINERAL OIL\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nMineral oil might decrease the absorption and levels of vitamin K.\nMineral oil can reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin K. Chronic use, both daily and intermittently, has been associated with prolonged clotting times (4495). Advise patients against regular or long-term use of mineral oil.\nless\nORLISTAT (Xenical, Alli)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nOrlistat might decrease the absorption and levels of vitamin K.\nOrlistat can reduce the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins, although the extent of its effect on food-derived vitamin K hasn't been determined (1730). In healthy people, small decreases in plasma vitamin K levels can occur, usually without any change in clotting times (9595, 10570). However, prolonged clotting times might occur when orlistat is added to warfarin therapy. This may be due to both direct effects of orlistat on vitamin K absorption, and reduced intake of vitamin K-rich fatty foods that cause unpleasant side effects with orlistat (11520). The manufacturer of orlistat recommends that all patients take a multivitamin supplement containing all fat-soluble vitamins, separating the dosing time by at least 2 hours from orlistat (1730).\nless\nRIFAMPIN (Rifadin)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nRifampin might decrease levels of vitamin K.\nThere are occasional reports of vitamin K deficiency associated with rifampin therapy, leading to prolonged clotting times and, in one case, a cerebral bleed (11517, 11518). Suggested mechanisms include reduced intestinal absorption of vitamin K, destruction of vitamin K-producing intestinal bacteria, and interference with enzymes that regenerate vitamin K from its inactive metabolite. Symptomatic vitamin K deficiency is most likely to occur in people with poor dietary intake or other contributory factors (11517, 11518).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with vitamin K. A tolerable upper limit for vitamin K has not been established due to lack of known toxicity (7135).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe varying side chains of vitamin K differentiate the compounds in terms of intestinal absorption and bioavailability (57). The MK-1 and MK-7 forms of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) are well absorbed, with peak blood levels occurring 4 hours after intake (102352). Menaquinones MK-7 through MK-10 are synthesized by bacteria in the colon, but absorption from this location is limited (16403). Bile salts are required for oral absorption of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), but not vitamin K4 (menadiol) (15). In human research, the oral absorption of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) from vegetables is 5% to 10%, and from supplements is approximately 13% (85435, 109911); bioavailability from kale with added vegetable oil is about 5% (85476).\n\nThe absorption and bioavailability of oral vitamin K1 (phytonadione) from food depends on the type of food and/or meal that it is contained in. The presence of added fat or consumption of vitamin K1 in fat may increase absorption. Furthermore, diet types may also impact the amount of vitamin K1 that is absorbed and bioavailable (85435, 85510).\n\nSome research suggests that vitamin K1 is absorbed faster and better from a pharmaceutical concentrate (Konakion) when compared with a natural food source, such as spinach (85510). However, other studies have shown no difference in plasma increases of vitamin K1 when comparing supplementation of vitamin K1 from broccoli versus a vitamin K1-fortified oil (85358).\nDistribution\nThe varying side chains of vitamin K differentiate the compounds in terms of transport and tissue distribution (57). Only small amounts of vitamin K are stored in body tissues (64). However, with adiposity, it appears that more vitamin K1 is stored in adipose tissue resulting in reduced levels in the blood circulation (85472).\n\nAt least the longer sidechain forms of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) are transported with both low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and triacylglycerol-rich fractions of plasma lipoproteins, reaching the liver and many extrahepatic tissues. In contrast, vitamin K1 and shorter forms of vitamin K2 may be transported only with the triacylglycerol fraction and are mainly cleared by the liver (16405, 91450).\n\nPostmortem analysis has found that vitamin K1 may be recovered in all tissues, with the highest levels in the liver, heart, and pancreas, and lower levels in the brain, kidneys, and lungs (85509). The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) has been recovered from the brain, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and lungs. In the brain and kidneys, levels of MK-4 are higher than vitamin K1. Other menaquinones (MK-6-11) have been recovered in the liver, heart, and pancreas (85509).\nMetabolism\nSome mammalian tissues, such as the pancreas, testes, and arterial vessel walls, are able to convert vitamin K1 into the MK-4 form of vitamin K2. Even at high dietary vitamin K1 intakes, the accumulated vitamin K in these tissues is almost exclusively MK-4 (16403). Vitamin K4 (menadiol) is a synthetic, water-soluble salt of vitamin K3 (menadione) and is converted to vitamin K3 in the liver (15). However, in humans, a single dose of three different types of vitamin K, namely vitamin K1 (phytonadione), and the menaquinone-4 and menaquinone-7 forms of vitamin K2, resulted in an approximately 5% to 25% increased catabolism to menadione (85423).\n\nPolymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in vitamin K metabolism, including vitamin K epoxide reductase and gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, play a role in plasma levels of vitamin K1 (phytonadione) (85463).\nExcretion\nIn humans, a single dose of three different types of vitamin K, namely vitamin K1 (phytonadione), and the menaquinone-4, and menaquinone-7 forms of vitamin K2, results in increased vitamin K3 (menadione) excretion in the urine, peaking 3 hours after intake (85423). Vitamin K appears to be excreted in both urine and feces and the form and route of excretion may depend on the amount in the diet (85384). The MK-7 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) has a much longer half-life than the MK-1 form, resulting in more stable serum levels and accumulation during prolonged intake (102352).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nVitamin K is a generic term for a group of related compounds with a common central ring structure, resulting in similar activity (57). Vitamin K1 (phytonadione, phylloquinone) is obtained from dietary sources, such as leafy green vegetables, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, plant oils, and margarine (57, 7135, 11285, 109911). Vitamin K2 is a group of menaquinones which are classified by the length of their aliphatic, isoprenoid side chain, designated as MK-1 through MK-10, obtained from meat, cheese, and eggs, and synthesized by bacteria (64, 16403, 102352, 109911). Vitamin K4 (menadiol) is a synthetic, water-soluble salt of vitamin K3 (menadione) and is converted to vitamin K3 in the body (15).\n\nSymptomatic vitamin K deficiency is rare, usually occurring only with severe malnutrition or conditions causing gastrointestinal malabsorption such as extensive bowel resection (505, 15556). It has also been reported in severely disabled, bedridden children on prolonged enteral tube feeding (15555), and after prolonged therapy with some antibiotics (4439, 9502, 11513, 11514, 11515, 11516).\nAnti-cataract effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that a high dietary intake of vitamin K1 reduces the risk of cataracts in older adults, possibly due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (95936).\nAnti-rheumatoid arthritis effects\nIn clinical research, the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) improved the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of conventional antirheumatic agents when taken together. As shown in laboratory research, this may be due to beneficial effects of vitamin K on the proliferation and viability of synovial cells in the cartilage (91449).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, taking vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) 360 mcg daily for 12 weeks reduces atherogenic coefficient, triglyceride-glucose index, and atherogenic index of plasma when compared with placebo, but not after adjustment for baseline values. It also did not change lipoprotein indices or metabolic score for insulin resistance index (109914).\nBlood clotting effects\nVitamin K is a coenzyme for the hepatic synthesis of blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor or plasma thromboplastin component), and X (Stuart-Prower factor), and proteins C and S in the liver (57, 7131, 7135). Vitamin K is also involved in carboxylation of gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) proteins that facilitate binding of coagulation factors to platelets (57). In adequate doses, vitamin K reverses the inhibitory effects of coumarin and warfarin derivatives on the synthesis of clotting factors (15).\n\nIn healthy adults aged 25-40 years who are not receiving anticoagulants, taking vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) 90 mcg orally daily for 30 days does not alter prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), or levels of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, when compared with baseline. This suggest that it does not alter hemostatic balance (109909).\nBone metabolism effects\nVitamin K is a cofactor for carboxylation of matrix Gla proteins, including osteocalcin, which is produced in osteoblasts, regulates accumulation of bone minerals including calcium, and promotes transition of osteoblasts to osteoclasts (6797, 7130, 7131, 7135, 15552, 15553, 102354, 109915).\n\nUndercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC, also called free osteocalcin) has a lower affinity for hydroxyapatite and therefore lower calcium binding (15553, 15554). Increased serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin are sometimes used as a marker of low vitamin K levels in bone, and supplementation with vitamin K and calcium decreases ucOC, increases carboxylated osteocalcin (cOC), and decreases the ratio of ucOC to cOC (56, 6797, 6798, 7130, 7131, 7135, 15553, 106404, 102354, 109915, 112106). However, the usefulness of osteocalcin levels is controversial due to variations in testing methodology and inconsistent clinical findings (7135). Higher ucOC levels have been linked to reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of hip fracture in elderly females (55, 56, 7130). Whether any form of supplemental vitamin K can improve BMD and reduce fracture rates is unclear as study results are conflicting (7130, 16404). A meta-analysis of 10 trials shows that a combination of vitamin K1 or K2 and calcium is associated with increased lumbar spine BMD when compared with controls, but has no effect on total femoral or femoral neck BMD (109915). Some limited research also suggests that combining vitamin K with vitamin D improves BMD (103921).\n\nThere are other potential mechanisms of action for vitamin K that do not involve its ability to gamma-carboxylate proteins. Vitamin K may decrease bone resorption by decreasing prostaglandin E2 synthesis in osteoclasts, and by effects on calcium balance, and interleukin 6 production in bone (7131, 15553). As shown in laboratory research, vitamin K might also increase bone formation by regulating the transcription of osteoblast markers involved in bone formation, including bone alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, and matrix Gla protein (85397).\n\nWhether people taking vitamin K antagonists or oral anticoagulants are at increased risk of fracture is controversial (51, 52, 63, 7134). Oral anticoagulants might have some effect on the BMD of the radius of the arm, but no effect on the bones of the hip and back (7135). The most pronounced effects of vitamin K antagonists appear to be on rapidly growing bone (7133).\n\nLow serum and bone levels of vitamin K, and high ucOC levels are seen in patients with Crohn disease and are correlated with increased bone resorption and decreased BMD of the lumbar spine (15552, 15553, 15554). Factors contributing to low vitamin K levels in Crohn disease may include undernutrition, malabsorption, and bowel resections (15552, 15553, 15554).\nCardiovascular effects\nVitamin K might play a role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. The development of atherosclerosis is linked to low serum levels of vitamin K (53, 57). Vitamin K is a cofactor for activation of matrix Gla-protein by carboxylation. This protein is found in blood vessel walls, where it inhibits vascular calcification (16405). Vascular vitamin K deficiency is thought to increase the amount of under-carboxylated, non-functional matrix Gla-protein, leading to increased calcification and atherosclerosis (95937). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with arterial stiffness undergoing chronic hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin K2 375 mcg orally daily for 24 weeks does not improve carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity when compared with no intervention (114777).\n\nThere is interest in using vitamin K to prevent cardiovascular disease. Some population research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2, especially the MK-4 fraction, is associated with a reduced risk of coronary calcification (16405), as well as a reduced risk of and mortality from coronary heart disease (85, 482). However, overall it appears that dietary intake of vitamin K1 does not affect cardiovascular outcomes (16405, 85414, 85482). Additionally, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in subjects with varying levels of cardiovascular risk shows that taking vitamin K1 or K2 daily for 4-144 weeks modestly improves markers of insulin resistance, but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, cholesterol levels, or blood pressure, when compared with placebo. The validity of this study is limited by heterogenous populations, dosing regimens, and study methods (114774).\n\nIn hemodialysis patients, accelerated vascular calcification is common due to low intakes and circulating levels of vitamin K. The MK-7 form of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) appears to reduce levels of the undercarboxylated, non-functional matrix Gla-protein in these patients (91450). However, the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 does not seem to reduce the rate of vascular calcification seen in hemodialysis patients (102352).\n\nVitamin K2 is also thought to restore mitochondrial function in cardiac muscle, increasing production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and improving muscle function (95937). This might improve cardiac output during exercise and in people with heart failure."

Meta-analyses of small clinical studies show that vitex agnus-castus moderately reduces breast pain due to cyclic mastalgia.\nTwo small meta-analyses of low-to-moderate quality clinical studies in patients with cyclic mastalgia show that taking vitex agnus-castus moderately reduces breast pain when compared with placebo (101981, 111753). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Doses of vitex agnus-castus dried fruit extract range from 3.2-40 mg daily, for 2-6 months (90617, 96250, 101981, 111753). Vitex agnus-castus is commonly used in proprietary products, alone or in combination with other herbs (Agnucaston/Cyclodynon, Bionorica AG, Femicur, Mastodynon, Bionorica AG, Monoselect Agnus, ZE 440) (13395).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Clinical research shows that vitex agnus-castus produces modest improvements in PMS symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking vitex agnus-castus fruit extract orally for 2-6 menstrual cycles seems to reduce symptoms of PMS, especially breast pain or tenderness (mastalgia), edema, constipation, irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, anger, and headache (7055, 7076, 7078, 7079, 13394, 15065, 41483, 41489, 41490, 41494, 90619, 101981). Doses of fruit extracts have varied from 3.5-40 mg daily, usually for 2-3 menstrual cycles (7055, 7076, 7078, 7079, 15065, 41483, 41489, 41490, 90619, 96435). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research, including 17 studies involving 2,401 patients, shows that taking vitex agnus-castus is comparable to fluoxetine or oral contraceptives, and modestly more effective than placebo, for reducing the symptoms of PMS. A sub-group analysis indicates that efficacy is not impacted by the dose or form used, although the dried powdered berries appear to be ineffective. The low quality of the included studies and the high level of bias and heterogeneity limit the validity of these findings (96435). Another meta-analysis limited to three randomized controlled trials shows that taking vitex agnus-castus increases the likelihood of PMS symptom remission by 2.6-fold over placebo (101979).\n\nSome clinical studies have used a specific dried extract of vitex agnus-castus fruit (Agnolyt, Madaus AG) (7076). Other studies used a specific fruit extract known as Ze 440 (Prefemin, Zeller AG), which is standardized to casticin content (7078, 90619). Additional studies have used the fruit extract BNO 1095 (Agnucaston/Cyclodynon, Bionorica AG) (15065, 41483, 41489, 41490).\n\nVitex agnus-castus has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical trial in generally healthy adult females shows that taking a specific combination product (PREMEN-CALM, Naturlider S.A.) containing vitex agnus-castus fruit extract 125 mg, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), melatonin, pyridoxine, rhodiola, and other ingredients orally daily for 3 months does not improve PMS symptoms when compared with placebo (114509). The reason for the discrepant findings is unclear but may be related to poor methodology. Additionally, it is unclear if the lack of observed benefit is related to the combination of ingredients used.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nFractures. Limited evidence suggests that vitex agnus-castus does not improve fracture healing rates.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific vitex agnus-castus dried fruit extract (Agnugol, Goldaru Pharmacy Company) 4 mg, alone or in combination with magnesium oxide (Nature Made Company) 250 mg, daily for 8 weeks does not improve long bone fracture healing when compared with placebo (90618).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for acne, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nAging skin. Vitex agnus-castus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial in postmenopausal adults with wrinkles shows that taking one capsule orally daily of a combination of vitex agnus-castus 400 mg, evening primrose oil 500 mg, soy isoflavones 100 mg, and black cohosh 520 mg (Estosalus, Max Biocare Pty Ltd) for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, skin smoothness, and wrinkle density scores when compared with placebo (109440).\nless\nAmenorrhea. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nAnxiety.

It is unclear if oral vitex agnus-castus is beneficial in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking a specific vitex agnus-castus extract (Agnucaston, Bionorica AG) daily for 3 months reduces pain, as measured on a visual analog scale, similarly to ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg / drospirenone 3 mg (Yasmin) taken daily (104975).\nless\nFibrocystic breast disease. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for fibrocystic breast disease, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nHyperprolactinemia. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for hyperprolactinemia, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral vitex agnus-castus is beneficial for female infertility.\nPreliminary clinical research in infertile females with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea shows that taking homeopathic vitex agnus-castus (Phyto Hypophyson L, Steierl-Pharma GmbH) 50 drops orally three times daily for 3 months does not increase the chance of getting pregnant (41470). Also, one small clinical study in those with infertility due to secondary amenorrhea or luteal insufficiency shows that taking a vitex agnus-castus preparation (Mastodynon, Bionorica GmbH, Neumarkt/Opf.) 30 drops twice daily for at least 3 months does not increase the chance of pregnancy when compared with placebo, although the study was likely inadequately powered to detect a difference (7077).\nless\nInsect repellent. Limited research suggests that topical vitex agnus-castus has insect repellent activity.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a carbon dioxide extract of vitex agnus-castus seeds seems to repel ticks and fleas for 6 hours, mosquitoes for 3-8 hours, and biting flies for 3 hours (13396). It is unclear how this compares with commonly used insect repellants.\nless\nInsomnia. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nLactation. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for stimulating lactation, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nMenopausal symptoms. Clinical research suggests that vitex agnus-castus can relieve some menopausal symptoms; however, most research uses vitex agnus-castus in combination with other treatments.\nClinical research shows that taking vitex agnus-castus extract 15 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves some menopausal symptoms, including anxiety and vasomotor dysfunction, by 76% and 88%, respectively, when compared with baseline. However, there was no effect on depression or sexual dysfunction (101980).\n\nVitex agnus-castus has also been studied as a component of combination products. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of vitex agnus-castus, equivalent to 1000 mg dried fruit, black seed powder 500 mg, and citalopram 20 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces vasomotor, psychosocial, and physical symptoms of menopause when compared with citalopram alone (100325). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking one capsule orally daily of a combination of vitex agnus-castus 400 mg, evening primrose oil 500 mg, soy isoflavones 100 mg, and black cohosh 520 mg (Estosalus, Max Biocare Pty Ltd) for 12 weeks moderately reduces the severity of hot flashes, sweating, sleep problems, depressed mood, and irritability when compared with placebo. There was no effect on plasma lipids, joint discomfort, anxiety, exhaustion, or sexual problems (105102). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitex agnus-castus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenorrhagia. It is unclear if oral vitex agnus-castus is beneficial in patients with menorrhagia.\nA meta-analysis of two moderate quality clinical trials in patients who had heavy menstrual periods shows that taking vitex agnus-castus does not reduce menstrual bleeding over the next 1-2 menstrual cycles when compared with placebo (101982). However, preliminary clinical research in patients using an intrauterine device (IUD) shows that taking vitex agnus-castus three times daily for 8 days, starting on the first day of menstruation, and repeated for four consecutive menstrual cycles, reduces the amount of bleeding by approximately 48% when compared with baseline. This reduction was similar to the effects of mefenamic acid 250 mg daily after 4 months, although treatment with mefenamic acid was superior during the first three months (90620).\nless\nMigraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for migraine headache, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Vitex agnus-castus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oligomenorrhea due to PCOS shows that taking a traditional combination product (Aslagh) containing equivalent amounts of essential oils of vitex agnus-castus fruit, fennel, and wild carrot seeds orally daily for 3 months, either alone or in combination with metformin, improves rates of menstrual bleeding and menstrual cyclicity similarly to metformin alone. All three groups experienced a significant improvement from baseline. Aslagh was taken as two, 500-mg capsules twice daily, except during menses; metformin was titrated over one week to a dose of 500 mg three times daily (108974).\nless\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Limited evidence suggests that vitex agnus-castus might improve symptoms of PMDD.\nIn a clinical trial, vitex agnus-castus 20-40 mg daily for 8 weeks was similar to fluoxetine 20-40 mg daily for relieving symptoms of PMDD. About 58% of patients responded to vitex agnus-castus, compared to about 68% of patients taking fluoxetine. Vitex agnus-castus was more effective for physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, swelling, cramps, and food cravings (12207, 41493).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there is interest in using oral vitex agnus-castus for RA, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of vitex agnus-castus for this condition.\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral vitex agnus-castus is beneficial in patients with sexual dysfunction.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy females under 44 years of age with sexual dissatisfaction shows that taking a specific vitex agnus-castus product (Agnugol, Goldaru Herbal Pharmaceutical Company) 3.2-4.8 mg orally once daily for 16 weeks modestly improves scores of sexual satisfaction, function, arousal, and desire when compared with placebo (109437). Additionally, a moderate-sized clinical study in females 50-69 years old with sexual dysfunction conducted in Iran shows that taking vitex agnus-castus 40 drops daily for 8 weeks improves sexual dysfunction scores from mild dysfunction to no dysfunction at 6 and 8 weeks when compared with placebo but does not improve scores at 4 weeks (112361).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of vitex agnus-castus for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of vitex agnus-castus.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of the vitex agnus-castus tree are the fruit and seed. The active constituents of vitex agnus-castus berries are the essential oils, iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, and diterpenes (7012, 7013, 10121). The primary essential oils consist of limonene, cineol, pinene, and sabinene (7013). The primary flavonoids include casticin, kaempferol, quercetagetin, orientin, isovitexin (7013) and apigenin (41473). The primary diterpenes include vitexilactone, rotundifuran, and 6-beta,7 beta-diacetoxy-13-hydroxy-labda-8,14-dien (10122). The relevant iridoid glycosides are aucubin, agnuside, and eurostide. Many vitex agnus-castus extracts are standardized to contain 6% agnuside (7012, 13393). It also contains the bitter principle, castine (13393). Vitex agnus-castus berries also contain several essential fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid (7012).\nAnalgesic effects\nLaboratory research suggests vitex agnus-castus might have analgesic activity (12649, 12650).\nAnti-allergy effects\nIn vitro, vitex agnus-castus has been shown to prevent the activation of mast cells via downregulation of the Fyn gene. Vitex agnus-castus has also demonstrated in vitro inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B , leukotriene C4 , interleukins-1, -4, and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and human monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (96435).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that vitex agnus-castus might inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells and other cancer cells including ovarian, cervical, gastric, colon, and lung (9990, 9991, 12648). However, due to the possible estrogenic effect of vitex agnus-castus, its safety in estrogen-sensitive conditions is unknown.\nAntihistamine effects\nLaboratory research suggests vitex agnus-castus might have antihistaminic activity (12649, 12650, 96435).\nAntimicrobial effects\nExtracts or essential oils of vitex agnus-castus have moderate in vitro activity against a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (12838, 41517), as well as fungi (41516).\nFertility effects\nAnimal research in female rats shows that taking vitex agnus-castus fruit extract 365 mg/kg daily orally during pregnancy, or while planning to become pregnant, may increase the risk of infertility, low fetal body weight, abortion, and stillbirth (109439).\nHormonal effects\nThe therapeutic effects of vitex agnus-castus have primarily been attributed to its indirect effects on various neurotransmitters and hormones. In females with hyperprolactinemia, vitex agnus-castus seems to suppress prolactin release. This may normalize luteal phase defects in the menstrual cycle (9988). In healthy men, the hormonal effects of vitex agnus-castus seem to be dose dependent. At doses around 120 mg of extract per day seem to increase prolactin release. Higher doses seem to suppress prolactin release (7016). Vitex agnus-castus does not appear to affect testosterone (7016). Preliminary research suggests that vitex agnus-castus might have estrogen and progestin activity (10979, 11456). The linoleic acid constituent of vitex agnus-castus appears to have estrogenic effects. Vitex agnus-castus appears to be selective for beta estrogen receptors (41473). The beta estrogen receptor predominates in the heart, vasculature, bone, and bladder but not the uterus (11456, 13397).\n\nThere is also interest in using vitex agnus-castus to treat hormonal changes from diabetes. Animal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that taking vitex agnus-castus fruit extract 100-400 mg/kg daily for 7 days normalizes diabetes-induced changes in body weight, as well as serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estrogen, and progesterone (109438).\nNeurotransmitter effects\nThe therapeutic effects of vitex agnus-castus have primarily been attributed to its indirect effects on various neurotransmitters and hormones. Vitex agnus-castus seems to affect dopamine, and possibly acetylcholine and opioid receptors (7014, 7015, 10122, 111754). Vitex agnus-castus extracts contain multiple active constituents that seem to have agonistic effects at pituitary dopamine (D2) receptors when used in higher doses. This dopaminergic activity inhibits basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated prolactin release (7014, 7015, 11456, 41502)."
